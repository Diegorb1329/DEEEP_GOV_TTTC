    I am writing grants with added functionality: 1. allocating a part of funds to dependencies and 2. affiliate program. (See the linked paper about science in danger and how this project saves science.) We can also create a liberal Web3 clone of arXiv and welcome scientists publish there and receive funding.

I mostly finished to write a [technical design document](https://github.com/vporton/salaries-science/raw/main/financing-science-algorithm.odt). Today I started to write [Motoko](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko) code for [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org) (a blockchain with powerful computer, not ZX Spectrum like Ethereum). Even L2 is of too much cost for storing dependencies on-chain, but it can be implemented at a reasonable cost using Internet Computer. I use CanDB database to store what in Solidity would be `map`.

I am welcoming other builders to join my project. Please, study Motoko, it is not very difficult. I (now unofficially) propose this project to receive GTC financing and be (when finished) linked from GitCoin site and Allo grants.

Should I now make official funding proposal?

Now the personal story why I decided to do this project:

As I mention in the linked to article I discovered something called _ordered semigroup actions_. It is an extremely important scientific discovery but for certain reasons (a chain of unfortunate events) I failed to publish it. We need to develop a new system of financing scientific publication to save science from such egregious failures of publishing and funding system.

Comments to this post are very welcome.
