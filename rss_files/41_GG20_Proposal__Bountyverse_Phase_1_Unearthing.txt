https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-proposal-bountyverse-phase-1-unearthing/18342
    **1. Name of Proposed Round**
Bountyverse Phase 1: Unearthing

**2. How many times has this round been run during a Gitcoin Grants round?**
This is our first time running a grants round. We have been grantees since GG14.

**3. How big is your team that will run this round? Who is your team?**
The team running this round will be

**Reviewers:**

* [Nakul](https://twitter.com/NakulVReddy)

**Operations:**

* [Madhav](https://twitter.com/madisampi04)
* [Gopika](https://twitter.com/gopika_sampat)

**4. How does this round align with Gitcoin’s [mission ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/update-gitcoins-adopted-mission-and-vision-statements/15039)and [essential intents](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/update-gitcoin-s-ratified-essential-intents-2023-2024-and-a-recap-of-our-successes/16818)?**

Bountyverse is a comprehensive program, developed by [Atlantis](https://twitter.com/AtlantisDAO1), This program merges the best aspects of hackathons, grants, and the focused direction of theme-driven innovations. Few months back [we floated the idea](https://x.com/AtlantisDAO1/status/1727420060388745711?s=20) with the community and [received positive signal](https://x.com/AtlantisDAO1/status/1750041609000141242?s=20) to further develop the program.

Our goal with Bountyverse is to assemble seasoned climate leaders **(Bounty Masters)** and scout for emerging climate talents **(Bounty Hunters)** and forge dynamic teams comprising of these changemakers. These teams then embark on a quest to conquer specific climate challenges (around resilience and regeneration) and eventually culminating in the creation of **Climate Artifacts** – invaluable resources for climate resilience and accelerating the adoption of [regenerative life support systems.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0273117794903298)
![image|690x292](upload://5kcP4BCfa071QuFlnFiLl8arwWh.jpeg)

This year’s edition, Bountyverse 2024 will consist of 3 phases and span over 9 months. **In this proposal we explain how we are using Gitcoin’s technologies for determining and allocating funds for the execution of Phase 1, titled “Unearthing”.**


![Bountyverse 2024 Roadmap|690x371](upload://reXjW1uh5hwjVtXGW4LOhCkpssg.jpeg)

With Bountyverse we aim to addresses the crucial **"last mile impact tracking"** challenge in public goods funding, by developing a system that quantifies the impact of the funds allocated. Atlantis' suite of impact tools ensure complete transparency, offering all funders, including Gitcoin, end-to-end traceability regarding utilizing their funding to effect tangible change.
>  Bountyverse is designed for maximizing the impact of builders and is directly in alignment with ***Gitcoin’s mission of creating technologies to enable communities to build, fund and protect what matters.***

**Bountyverse is closely aligned with Gitcoin’s essential intents**

> Network Effects -  Maximizing the network effects of our ecosystem to grow product adoption.

The aim of Bountyverse is to identify high quality founders who will in turn bring their established community members to the Gitcoin ecosystem. The eligibility criteria and fund allocation mechanism will drive grantees to onboard more community members hence maximizing the network effects of the Gitcoin ecosystem.

> “Community First - Cultivating a community that thrives on providing positive change and meaningful engagement”

Bountyverse brings new utilities to existing GTC holders and Passport holders as both these primitives are being integrated into Atlantis suite of Impact tools. We believe the program will bring more meaningful community engagement.

> “Financial Longevity - Ensuring the economic health and vitality of Gitcoin”

Bountyverse will bring novel usecases to :
- GTC (via Impact Bounty rewards), 
- Passport (used to protect bounties from sybil attack). 
- Increase the GMV of Allo protocol by using QF in multiple instances across Bountyverse ( in Phase 1 and in Phase 3)

**5. What do you anticipate the size of the matching pool will be (either fundraised from partners, raised independently through your connections, or a combination of both)?**
* Total Target: **$60K**
* Already Committed: **$15K**
* Seeking matching amount from GG20 Pool: **$25K**
* Team’s Remaining Target: **$20K** (from Bounty Sponsors + Existing Connection)

**6.Please describe the eligibility criteria you envision for this proposed round.**

* **Leadership Transparency:** Eligible projects must have identified and doxxed leaders who are accountable and accessible. This transparency fosters trust and ensures project leaders are committed to their initiatives.
* **Proven Expertise:** We seek founders with a solid track record in developing solutions that enhance climate resilience or have demonstrated capabilities in creating regenerative life support systems. This expertise is crucial for the success and impact of the funded projects.
* **Commitment to Community Engagement:** Founders must commit to deploying at least 80% of the total funds received as bounties through the Citizen App. This approach ensures that the broader community is engaged and benefits from the project, fostering a collaborative ecosystem.
* **Transparency in Fund Utilization**: Founders must be willing to share the outcomes and impacts of their fund deployment publicly. This transparency builds trust and provides valuable insights and lessons for the broader community.
* **Community and Project Maturity:** Eligible projects should have been operational for at least three months, possess a healthy and engaging community, and have a verifiable online presence. This criterion ensures that funded projects have a solid foundation and are well-positioned to utilize the grant effectively.

**7.How large is your community approximately?**

* Twitter: 4.3K
* Beta Testers: 4.1K

**8. What type of projects would you like to fund?**

* **Climate Resilience Initiatives**: We aim to fund projects that actively enhance the resilience of communities and ecosystems against the adverse impacts of climate change. This includes but is not limited to, initiatives focused on disaster preparedness, adaptive infrastructure, and sustainable resource management.
* **Regenerative Life Support Systems:** Our funding priority includes projects dedicated to developing and implementing regenerative practices that restore, renew, and revitalize our planet's ecosystems. Key areas of interest include wetland restoration, agroforestry, circular economy models, permaculture, and soft path energy & water systems.
* **Proven Impact and Artifact Creation capability:** We are looking for projects with a track record of producing high-quality outputs, be they in the form of code, concepts, or content, that contribute significantly to their field. The ability to create tangible artifacts that demonstrate clear benefits and scalable impact is a critical factor in our funding decisions.
* **Community Engagement and Maturity:** Eligible projects should have established a robust and active community presence. They must demonstrate a history of meaningful engagement, collaboration, and a commitment to collective action. We value projects supported by a dedicated following and show potential for broader community mobilization.
* **Beyond Decarbonization:** While we acknowledge the importance of decarbonization efforts, our funding focuses on projects beyond carbon reduction. We seek to support initiatives that offer holistic and integrated solutions to environmental challenges, emphasizing restoration and regeneration over mere mitigation.

**9. Approximately how many grantees do you believe will be eligible to apply to this round?**

We are placing a strong emphasis on high quality founders leading established communities, hence we are enabling participation for a maximum of 20 projects.

It is imperative to note the second order effects these grantees will produce when they bring their community members to the Gitcoin ecosystem. Further, the eligibility criteria and the fund allocation mechanism of Bountyverse will ensure the infusion of a larger number of high quality members to the Gitcoin ecosystem. 

**10.Impact Assessment: If and how do you intend to assess grantee impact over successive rounds?**

Atlantis has developed a suite of impact tools to capture, assess and measure end to end impact of projects within Bountyverse -

* Impact Foundry : Grantees use this tool to deploy funds via impact bounties
* Impact Miner : Grantees’ communities use this product to take on impact bounties, capture data and get rewarded
* GTC will be used as the token reward for Impact Bounties and will be integrated with Impact Foundry and Impact Miner.
* Gitcoin passport will be integrated within the Impact Miner for sybil resistance and minimise double accounting of impact.

![Phase 1_ Unearthing Flowchart|588x499](upload://qMkEzbpKpX0N9TyDCGWTYsa3VGS.jpeg)


**11.Is there anything else that community members should consider when voting for which rounds to focus on in the upcoming GG20 grants round?**

This is our first application to run a grants round and we would love the opportunity to demonstrate the concept we have developed for last mile impact tracking which can be used to create high impact outputs and in the process produce high utility public goods artifacts.

Since Bountyverse is an annual event which spans 9 months, the program in its current format provides two unique opportunities every year to use Gitcoin’s technologies to build what matters. It also comes with promising potential to bring novel use cases to GTC, Passport and Allo especially in emerging markets and frontiers of web3 adoption.

            <p>I’m glad to see that <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/atlantian001">@Atlantian001</a> and the Atlantis team are taking this step.<br>
They are seasoned grantees known by raising red flags when others are trying to game the system.</p>
<p>They have been focused on weaving together the different projects challenges into a one-stop-shop where people can find how to help them and obtain rewards, this is the Citizens App.</p>
<p>Also, they have experienced with local events and hackathon with the Green Pill Festival.</p>
<p>Even if my voice in this decision is not counted, I come here to morally support them. Rooting for Atlantis is rooting for common good.</p>
