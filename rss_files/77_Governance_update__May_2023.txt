    # Gitcoin Governance Report

## May 2023

Find attached the Gitcoin Governance Report. This report chronicles governance activity for the month of May of 2023 and looks forward to the month of June. As always, we welcome any feedback to make this report better.

The objective of this communication is to:

* Improve governance transparency.

* Provide a go-to platform for proposal and comment summaries.

* Highlight a couple governance initiatives during the period

* Illustrate GCP and non GCP efforts being worked or evaluated.

May was a bit of an adjustment as we attempted to limit time to 20-25 hours per week as per [[GCP-007] S18 Fund Thin Governance](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gcp-007-s18-fund-thin-governance/14149) so we can evaluate the accuracy of the proposal. According to the [time tracker](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gTLsNBFhrsqYXFocqUFS-ysfoz0qD3WzMelQRAjRE1M/edit?usp=sharing), time spent high but, but we will continue to course correct in June.

### Governance proposals and performance during the period:
![image|690x233](upload://eZBevefE6z9y9eXWXdQWEtIK51V.png)

This chart can be an illustration of 1) governance engagement during the period and 2) individual proposal performance.  Over time, we will be able to illustrate if governance changes influence token voting and in later versions, individual voter influence. To note ‚Äì Gitcoin has 8 stewards who hold between 800K to 1.6M tokens ‚Äì which can influence the variability in tokens cast during any single vote.

### Deep dive of governance activity during the period:
**DAO Delegation week: May 22 to 26**
Gitcoin partnered with [Tally.xyz](https://www.tally.xyz/) on the first ever [delegation week](https://delegationweek.com/gaslessdelegation) where Gitcoin, Arbitrum, Uniswap, Pool Together and ENS pitched in to cover the cost of delegation. Participation from Gitcoin was primarily to show solidarity with the ecosystem and to build leadership equity. During the week, we encouraged GTC token holders to 1) [delegate](https://delegate.gitcoin.co/) governance tokens2) review your delegate [performance](https://twitter.com/gitcoin/status/1661469189801144320?s=20) and 3) [drop some love](https://grants.gitcoin.co/) to delegates.

The delegation results were not astronomical, but Gitcoin did see a slight bump in delegation and redelegation activities as seen in charts below.
![image|690x214](upload://fIExZGKCEt1zqtKFfsXaaxYINAH.png)

Gitcoin hosted or participated in the following three twitter spaces related to the week:

* https://twitter.com/gitcoin/status/1661402268543991808
* https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1eaKbrAjOkkKX

And thanks to MMM, Gitcoin had some of the best delegation memes:

* https://twitter.com/gitcoin/status/1661469183811682306
     
Increased spam activity on the Gitcoin forum:
In late April and early May, Gitcoin experienced a bump in spam activity on the forum.  While most of the activity has muted, we are looking to Passport to help us gate activity on the forum.  This move can be viewed as a gating or centralizing mechanism, prior to implementation we expect to take this to a token holder vote before implementing.  Target timeline is late June / early July. 
![image|690x353](upload://9QbssZBDR2R8a5XF7jgCCUmpUP6.jpeg)
### Looking forward ‚Äì governance work coming up in June

We have five ‚Äúbig rocks‚Äù of work planned in June, however I am not sure we will get all of them completed in the period, Variables in delivery include other last moment priorities and effort required to pass proposals:

**Big Rocks for June**

* [[Proposal] - Amendments to the Steward Council](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-amendments-to-the-steward-council/15118/3)

* [[Proposal] - Gating who can make a Snapshot governance proposals](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gating-who-can-make-a-snapshot-governance-proposals/15050/4)

* Steward Council Nominations & Elections

**Smaller Rocks for June**

* Quadratic Voting in the DAO ‚Äì it is time?

* Voting privacy ‚Äì exploring shielded voting

* Gating the forum using Passport

* Snapshot voting clean up (QV subsite)

* Keep or kill AI efforts related to forum summaries.

* Using Push protocol for governance communications

* Redesign of the monthly report ‚Äì make it MMM friendly.

The entire list of governance project work along with daily movement can be seen [here](https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/7e87f59bd8b5406abf2fe27c2644389d?v=516683c86577466990b706aed22ff80a&pvs=4). This includes GCP-007 work and extracurricular deliverables.
![image|690x278](upload://sAtkOx2VOE1rDZEC9mbNEkWkR4T.png)

Thanks for reading this month‚Äôs summary ‚Äì we appreciate any and all feedback. For our next steps, we will request a Tally vote to transfer 1/3rd of the approved budget ($6800 of GTC) for the work completed in May.

            <p>**May 29 update:<br>
Doing what we can to make governance fun, or at least easy.  Ok how about just ‚Äúeasier‚Äù. Last week was a blur as we took a couple days off but still managed to go all-in on Delegation week thanks to MMM.  Here is your weekly Governance update.</p>
<p><strong>Last week</strong><br>
<em>Voting:</em><br>
Last week we saw the passage [GCP-011] - Support the Funding the Commons Hackathon and Conference on  (<a href="https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0x1bf4e07b5919f9fd92e2e08ddbcb681f5e84f16f2621aa0844690a7d9b73aff5" class="inline-onebox">Snapshot</a>).  Note this proposal had several funding options and the winner was to fully fund the initiative with the requested resources and matching pool funds ($100k in Matching Pool Funds $60k in production support).  This proposal will now move to Tally to move funds.</p>
<p>Also last week we saw the passage of the S18/S19 <a href="https://www.tally.xyz/gov/gitcoin/proposal/57">MMM</a> Workstream Budget Request on Tally and the S18-S19 Gitcoin <a href="https://www.tally.xyz/gov/gitcoin/proposal/58">Public Goods Funding</a> Workstream Budget.</p>
<p><em>Outreach:</em><br>
Last week Gitcoin partnered with <a href="https://www.tally.xyz/">Tally.xyz</a> on the first ever <a href="https://delegationweek.com/gaslessdelegation">delegation week</a> where Gitcoin, Arbitrum, Uniswap, Pool Together and ENS pitched in to cover the cost of delegation and hyped up the need to</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://delegate.gitcoin.co/">delegate</a> your governance tokens</li>
<li>check if your delegate is still voting on <a href="https://twitter.com/gitcoin/status/1661469189801144320?s=20">your behalf</a>
</li>
<li>find a <a href="https://twitter.com/gitcoin/status/1662173310560669696?s=20">new delegate</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://grants.gitcoin.co/">drop some love</a> to those working hard on your behalf.</li>
</ol>
<p>Want even more delegation?? Here were a couple Gitcoin twitter spaces:<br>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/shawn16400">@shawn16400</a></p>
<p>For your pains to kick off the spam users, how about to integrate Gitcoin passport in Discourse (forum)?<br>
which means we need to develop a plugin for Discourse (most DAO used it as governance forum).</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle">@kyle</a> your thought?</p>

            <p>**May 22 update:<br>
Stewards, contributors and citizens, here is your governance update for the week of May 22th. We are playing with the format of this newsletter to make is easy to navigate and consume:</p>
<p><strong>Last week</strong><br>
Last week we saw the passage [GCP-010] Evolving Gitcoin Grants: The Q.E.D. (Quadratic Experimentation and Development) Program on (<a href="https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0x8b8e0ed4ec6ef5031b407d4abbc41a604c2f14528a12ec87e21aa5f9e04cabc7" class="inline-onebox">Snapshot</a>) but the failure of S18 Gitcoin Allo Budget and the S18 Gitcoin Passport Workstream Budgets on Tally due to a failure to reach quorum (2.5M).  Remember votes on Tally are not actual decisions, but just the execution of decisions made on Snapshot.  This being the case, these two proposals will be posted again on Tally and we will have to chase the significant token holders to help us get past quorum.  Note, this does not mean those proposals are at risk.  It means our on chain-execution could use some improvement.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/supreme">@Supreme</a> Solid question.  After I kicked out about 200 users I had a moment of panic‚Ä¶ like I might have just ejected the next generation of Gitcoin fans who happened to be attracted to the increased governance discussion.  But no, they were just fake accounts.</p>
<p>Here is a chart with some artistic wizardry that illustrates sign ups in relation to our past budget cycles.   Net, we typically have a bump around budgets as there is more governance chatter, but this round was more like the March surge.<br>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/shawn16400">@shawn16400</a> having a rundown like this is so very helpful to keep up to date! Thank you!!</p>
<p>I would like to comment on the spike in accounts made on the forum. It is great so many spam accounts were able to be purged.</p>
<p>I also can‚Äôt help but to notice a direct correlation between the spike in new accounts and the voting of workstream budgets.</p>
<p>While this could be a coincidence, I have to wonder if there is any  data around previous workstream budget voting periods.</p>

            <p>**May 15 update: updated Gitcoin Vision MIssion and Purpose, governance proposals, and forum noise.</p>
<p>Stewards, contributors and citizens, here is your governance update for the week of May 15th.  We are playing with the format of this newsletter to make is easy to navigate and consume:</p>
<p><strong>Last week</strong><br>
Last week we saw the passage of all four workstream budgets, in addition to three GCPs for a total spending of ~$6.57M in spending over Season 18 and 19, not including reserves or treasury carryover.  While this number might seem high, recall most of this spending is driven by the move to a 2x per year budgeting cycle.<br>
Note, last week we also saw a spike in new signups mostly attributed to a spam attack.  We squelched about 300 accounts in a 5 day period but we ask for your continued diligence to report suspected spam comments and accounts.<br>
<img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/6/68ceaa05cc685b987b67da92e356524b3ed783f3.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="eXaqPN3AAwOZlICmphY4tAJY6Wv" width="470" height="308"></p>

S18 Gitcoin Passport Workstream Budget (<a href="https://www.tally.xyz/gov/gitcoin/proposal/55">link</a>)<br>
This week we will likely see tally votes for the GCPs as well as the other budgets.  Recall this is a procedural vote as decisions have already been made in snapshot.</p>

<p><strong>S18/19 - Gitcoin Passport Workstream Budget Request</strong><br>
<strong>VOTE ENDS May 9, 2023, 10:00 AM EST</strong><br>

<strong>Proposal Summary:</strong><br>
Gitcoin Passport workstream aims to achieve four key outcomes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Grow adoption and usage of Passport through on-chain mechanisms, user experience improvements, and DevRel initiatives.</li>
<li>Generate upside through strategic tests, including at least two revenue experiments, for long-term sustainability.</li>
<li>Gather a plurality of scoring mechanisms for communities to adopt, encouraging innovation and versatility.</li>
<li>Galvanize community experiences around Passport by researching and potentially enabling custom community experiences and integration capabilities.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Measurement of progress:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Growing adoption: Increase Passports by 5x, maintain average stamp count of 8 or higher, and increase integrators by 5x.</li>
<li>Generating upside: Test at least two experiments and generate at least $1 in revenue.</li>
<li>Gathering scoring mechanisms: Ensure at least 5 mechanisms available and at least 4 are used.</li>
<li>Galvanize community experiences: Research and decide on building custom community experiences.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Economics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Requesting 832,372 GTC (equivalent to $1,323,472) for S18-19, excluding reserves and rolled over amounts.</li>
<li>GTC amount and reserve value will be adjusted based on market value at the time of proposal.</li>
<li>Funds will be requested through one Snapshot vote but released over two Tally votes for accountability and price fluctuation mitigation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary of the discussion</strong></p>
<p>The discussions of this DAO proposal are generally supportive of the Passport team and their initiatives for the next two seasons. However, some concerns were raised about the measurement metrics and the effectiveness of Passport‚Äôs sybil defense. The team was urged to focus on measuring what matters instead of capturing vanity metrics. There was also a suggestion to allocate additional budget for an IRL activation in the fall. Overall, the sentiment is positive and the proposal was moved to snapshot for voting.</p>

<li>Abstain</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary of the discussion</strong></p>
<p>The overall sentiment of the replies is supportive of the proposal to fund Gitcoin Governance for Season 18 and 19. Many of the replies praise the work of Shawn, the proposed Governance Coordinator, and emphasize the importance of governance in the DAO. Some concerns are raised about the potential risks of using a temporary funding mechanism like the GCP for operational work and the possibility of overpaying for a service that could be delivered by a lower-cost resource. However, the majority of the replies express confidence in Shawn‚Äôs abilities and the importance of funding this work for the success of the DAO. There is also some discussion about the scope of the proposal and the need for transparency and accountability in the GCP process. The proposal outlines deliverables that can be used as a barometer for success, and there is a desire to make it simple for stewards to maintain context. The work of governance is seen as a hard problem that takes lots of hours, and Shawn is praised for his thoughtful, fact-based approach to governance work. Some suggest funding for one season to see how the steward council and other items listed perform.</p>

<strong>Proposal Summary:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Proposal is for Gitcoin to refine the Quadratic Funding (QF) model and explore novel solutions to enhance security and fairness</li>
<li>Q.E.D. (Quadratic Experimentation and Development) program aims to develop collusion-resistant QF mechanisms for Gitcoin Grants</li>
<li>Q.E.D. will deliver a tailored mathematical framework, empirical analysis, product roadmap, educational articles, and bi-weekly updates to the Gitcoin community</li>
<li>A ‚Äòyes‚Äô vote is not a vote to change Gitcoin‚Äôs core QF algorithm, but to fund R&amp;D aimed at giving Gitcoin a button it could press to change the core QF algorithm</li>
<li>Voting ‚Äòyes‚Äô supports allocating the necessary funds for staffing costs ($27,240 in USDC) and collaborating with experts in the field</li>
<li>Voting ‚Äòno‚Äô means the current QF mechanism would remain unchanged and the resources allocated for this proposal would not be used for the Q.E.D. program.</li>

However, there are suggestions for providing more entry-point materials and measuring success in terms of traction built with community chatter around the project. Overall, the sentiment is positive and supportive of the proposal.</p>

According to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gTLsNBFhrsqYXFocqUFS-ysfoz0qD3WzMelQRAjRE1M/edit?usp=sharing">time tracker</a>, time spent high but, but we will continue to course correct in June.</p>

<p>This chart can be an illustration of 1) governance engagement during the period and 2) individual proposal performance.  Over time, we will be able to illustrate if governance changes influence token voting and in later versions, individual voter influence. To note ‚Äì Gitcoin has 8 stewards who hold between 800K to 1.6M tokens ‚Äì which can influence the variability in tokens cast during any single vote.</p>

<p><strong>DAO Delegation week: May 22 to 26</strong><br>
Gitcoin partnered with <a href="https://www.tally.xyz/">Tally.xyz</a> on the first ever <a href="https://delegationweek.com/gaslessdelegation">delegation week</a> where Gitcoin, Arbitrum, Uniswap, Pool Together and ENS pitched in to cover the cost of delegation. Participation from Gitcoin was primarily to show solidarity with the ecosystem and to build leadership equity. During the week, we encouraged GTC token holders to 1) <a href="https://delegate.gitcoin.co/">delegate</a> governance tokens2) review your delegate <a href="https://twitter.com/gitcoin/status/1661469189801144320?s=20">performance</a> and 3) <a href="https://grants.gitcoin.co/">drop some love</a> to delegates.</p>
<p>The delegation results were not astronomical, but Gitcoin did see a slight bump in delegation and redelegation activities as seen in charts below.<br>

<p>Increased spam activity on the Gitcoin forum:<br>
In late April and early May, Gitcoin experienced a bump in spam activity on the forum.  While most of the activity has muted, we are looking to Passport to help us gate activity on the forum.  This move can be viewed as a gating or centralizing mechanism, prior to implementation we expect to take this to a token holder vote before implementing.  Target timeline is late June / early July.<br>
