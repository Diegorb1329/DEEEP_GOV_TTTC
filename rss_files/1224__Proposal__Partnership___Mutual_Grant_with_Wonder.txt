https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-partnership-mutual-grant-with-wonder/10170
    
## Summary

This proposal, if passed, would issue 100,000 GTC for governance rights equating to 2,500,000 $WONDER tokens (2.5% of total supply) when Wonder‚Äôs token is live.

The purpose of this alliance is to solidify the partnership between Gitcoin and Wonder where we can work together to enable DAOs to succeed.

## Motivation

Gitcoin and Wonder are pursuing aligned missions.

Gitcoin‚Äôs mission is to build & fund the open web; Wonder is building the necessary tools to facilitate thriving projects on the open web.

Wonder‚Äôs task management system allows DAOs to intuitively organize projects, pay contributors with their native token, and onboard new members with ease.

Gitcoin, a DAO of DAOs, benefits from partnership with projects that provide the infrastructure for a nascent DAO ecosystem. Specifically, Wonder can help Gitcoin-funded projects better onboard and retain contributors, improve productivity, and increase visibility within the DAO. In addition, it would allow for:

* Integrations that help Gitcoin source, fund, and scale more public good projects
* Collaboration on job fairs, hackathons, and events for DAOs
* Co-Creating tools to help the Gitcoin DAO operate more efficiently
* Enabling Gitcoin to have a voice in the future direction of Wonder

Overall, this partnership between Gitcoin and Wonder would likely mark the first of many collaborations with projects in the 'DAO tooling' space.

## Background on Wonder

[Wonder](https://www.wonderverse.xyz/) was founded by [Andros](https://twitter.com/0xAndros) (Kernel Block 4), [Adam](https://twitter.com/Adam_Ha_Yes), and [0xtocqueville](https://github.com/terryli0095) to help empower builders with the tools they need to change the world for the better. We believe in an intentional approach to crafting the future of work and play.

In just over two months Wonder has launched their private alpha and grown into a community with over 11,000 members and 45,000 people on their waitlist.

Wonder has been collaborating proactively with impactful DAO partners for their alpha launch. Highlights and examples of purposeful collaborations include:

* Helping [Unchain DAO](https://app.wonderverse.xyz/organization/UnchainDAO/boards)‚Äôs coordination efforts to raise $4m USD in humanitarian aid for Ukrainian civilians.
* Onboarding and partnering with Developer DAO to establish a standard around credentialing for work/tasks in web3.
* Onboarding and partnering with Radicle to establish best practices around streaming payments via [drips](https://www.drips.network/).
* Onboarding and working with Orca protocol to bring pod membership and fine-grained permissions around multisig on chain.

## Specification

The passing of this proposal would transfer 100,000 GTC to 0x231F77F0c4D7a9F2E20767c7B76ae745A6c547f9, Wonder‚Äôs specified Treasury address.

On the launch of Wonder‚Äôs token, 2,500,000 $WONDER would be transferred to 0xde21F729137C5Af1b01d73aF1dC21eFfa2B8a0d6, Gitcoin‚Äôs multisig address.

In addition, upon launch, 1% of Wonder‚Äôs treasury will be used for QF rounds via [Gitcoin Aqueduct](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-aqueduct/9684), to fund projects that are on or will be started on Wonder.

Use of Funds

To ensure long term alignment, Wonder will hold no less than 50% of the tokens received through 2024 and act as a meta-delegate in the Gitcoin ecosystem.

To ensure long term alignment, Gitcoin will hold no less than 50% of the tokens received through 2024 and act as a meta-delegate in the Wonder ecosystem.

1% of Wonder‚Äôs treasury will be used for QF rounds via [Gitcoin Aqueduct](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-aqueduct/9684), to fund projects that are on or will be started on Wonder.

## Benefits

* A long term collaboration between Gitcoin and Wonder
* Integrations of Gitcoin on Wonder‚Äôs platform
* 2,500,000 $WONDER tokens
* 1% of $WONDER treasury would flow back into QF PGF mechanisms

## Drawbacks

100,000 GTC would be removed from the treasury.

            <p>Thank you everyone for your feedback! Really respect the Gitcoin community and this is definitely a great example of DAO governance working <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/pop">@Pop</a> <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/fishbiscuit">@Fishbiscuit</a> we‚Äôre keen to work with your suggestions on more due process and creating an escrow contract for when our token is live. We assumed the token swap would only happen when our token was live, but would want to formalize that in the proposal to make it clear.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we‚Äôre planning on working with the DAO tooling work group to use Wonder for setting up per-project bounties/tasks so we can get some feedback there as well!</p>

<p>In that case since deliberation during this proposal lead to the proposal being changed perhaps a different post with a new proposal would make sense. I would also ask <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/pop">@Pop</a> here. But I believe the process should start again.</p>

</aside>
<p>I think the issue we discussed in the Steward Council yesterday is that <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-dao-governance-process-v2-updated/7860">the governance flow</a> requires a proposal to be up for 5 days and have 5 stewards commenting. I know it a technicality but I think this is one point.</p>
<p>The second was around the lack of a token at present that a few of the steward council brought up - not without merit in terms of implications for the DAO. I think establishing a committee to evaluate, vet and recommend suitable proposals based on an established matrix would be incredibly valuable.</p>
<p>Also - an escrow contract should be established for any such mutual grants.  Both parties would put the tokens into said contract - this is especially important in this situation where the $WONDER token doesn‚Äôt exist yet. So then the GTC swap would only activate once the $WONDER token is also in the escrow. Does this make sense?</p>

            <p>after much deliberation, I decided to vote against this proposal in its current form for 2 reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Proposal needs closer review</strong> - as some stewards pointed out, and as <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation">@ceresstation</a>  <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/constructing-a-mutual-grants-committee/10347/3">noted in his post here</a> we need a formal process for how we conduct swaps. I‚Äôd like to take this chance to bump up in priority the call for a mutual grants review committee and include Wonder as our first candidate for review. this is to ensure Gitcoin remains credibly neutral and have an unbiased approach to conducting these token swaps as we are not only committing to help provide funds to the project but also to become a partner in each others‚Äô journey through governance. I‚Äôd like to work with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/pop">@Pop</a>  and <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation">@ceresstation</a>  to make this a reality as soon as we can!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Procedural</strong> - per the <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-dao-governance-process-v2-updated/7860/12">new governance rules</a>, after stewards have given comments, an updated proposal needs to be available on the forum and then finally be posted onto the snapshot. this is to ensure consistency and as part of keeping processes open and preserved for posterity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>a path forward would be to 1) engage the Wonder team for a revised proposal 2) update the proposal by working closely with stewards that volunteered to be on the mutual grants committee 3) post on forum and proceed with the voting process</p>

<p>That is true. And imo that was a mistake. I strongly believe token swaps should happen only if both tokens are live.</p>

<p>Seconding <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/lefterisjp">@lefterisjp</a> on his comment this proposal request a budget of 100,000k GTC while we can see on the Snapshot the amount is at 50,000k GTC, from this post I can still see the requested amount is 100,000k witch differ and I do think we did not had enough time to deliberate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs not clear on how or where the funds will be used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wonder token has not launched yet so there is no guarantee.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Ideas: Why don‚Äôt we just do a token swap at this point once you guys have launched your token? Why do you need 100,000k - 50,000k GTC?</p>

[Proposal] Partnership & Mutual Grant with Wonder
lefterisjp

            <p>I voted against this mutual grant. I already explained the line of reasoning to my fellow stewards in the call we had today. Let me sum up here:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I don‚Äôt believe this proposal has followed due process. The original proposal was for 100k GTC. In fact as of right now the post still says 100k. The snapshot is for 50k GTC, but it links to this post which says 100k GTC. The amount changed somewhere in the middle of the discussion but not enough time has been given to deliberate and the proposal has not been updated accordingly.<br>
</p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/8/858989e8df83b4a28f9ce8384552273874e8b4a0.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/j3kb5FVYE1aHVd3SARn0aIr3G5G.png?dl=1" title="2022-04-14_17-08" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/8/858989e8df83b4a28f9ce8384552273874e8b4a0_2_690x245.png" alt="2022-04-14_17-08" data-base62-sha1="j3kb5FVYE1aHVd3SARn0aIr3G5G" width="690" height="245" srcset="/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/8/858989e8df83b4a28f9ce8384552273874e8b4a0_2_690x245.png, /uploads/db4391/original/2X/8/858989e8df83b4a28f9ce8384552273874e8b4a0.png 1.5x, /uploads/db4391/original/2X/8/858989e8df83b4a28f9ce8384552273874e8b4a0.png 2x" data-small-upload="/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/8/858989e8df83b4a28f9ce8384552273874e8b4a0_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is a mutual grant acting as a bet for something that may exist in the future. Wonder does not have a token yet. We are effectively setting up a price floor for their token which is not something I believe gitcoin should be touching at all. I am not againt such mutual grants with projects that already have tokens in the market but a grant for a promise of a token is not something I think gitcoin should do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel (this could be my personal shortcoming) that not enough deliberation and discussion has happened on this proposal. I learned about it 2 days ago. We got an explanation by Scott in the stewards call today. But the snapshot already ends in less than 24 hours. For such proposals I really think stewards should be given a heads up and context much earlier in the process.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The partnership is positive sum in the sense that it helps Wonder to have GitcoinDAO in its network, and it helps GitcoinDAO to have stakes in Wonder since that implies a say in the direction of a DAO tool that is already serving large DAOs and making them more efficient. This will make Wonder more decentralized and transparent by bringing the Gitcoin community to it, and it will make Gitcoin more efficient and productive since the Wonder team will start building features that specifically fit GitcoinDAO‚Äôs needs.   Another good illustration of the positive sum nature of this collaboration is that 1% of the Wonder treasury will be dedicated to quadratic funding of Gitcoin grant rounds that use Wonder for project management.</p>

Also, having large DAOs on the platform that are already doing work and have high throughput productivity requirements means that the contributors on Wonder are all typically experienced with web3 projects and decentralized work environments .</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gitcoin, a DAO of DAOs, benefits from partnership with projects that provide the infrastructure for a nascent DAO ecosystem. Specifically, Wonder can help Gitcoin-funded projects better onboard and retain contributors, improve productivity, and increase visibility within the DAO. In addition, it would allow for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrations that help Gitcoin source, fund, and scale more public good projects</li>
<li>Collaboration on job fairs, hackathons, and events for DAOs</li>
<li>Co-Creating tools to help the Gitcoin DAO operate more efficiently</li>
<li>Enabling Gitcoin to have a voice in the future direction of Wonder</li>

            <p>I am supportive of this proposal and think the revision of the amount to 50K is a good one.</p>
<p>I will acknowledge that I have been part of conversations we‚Äôve been having internally at the DAO around partnerships &amp; mutual grants strategy which many folks who are commenting may not be privy to, and we should do a better job surfacing these with stewards and coming to alignment collectively on the strategy, in addition to this specific proposal. I think <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation">@ceresstation</a>‚Äôs <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/constructing-a-mutual-grants-committee/10347">post from earlier today</a> does a great job in starting to surface this discussion.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/griff">@griff</a> <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/philh">@philh</a> <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/lefterisjp">@lefterisjp</a>  thank you for your thoughts and feedback!</p>
<p>Totally understand your concerns but I would like to highlight parts of the proposal.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, this is not an investment, but a partnership like the ones previously passed with <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/0xfafbac6a39f5991497856ac2c4b941c0b020d442280eea8eeebe0b88bd6f913c" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Developer DAO</a> and <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0x29eaaff1ca752785b508298b4aaf5d4bf3173e9b3859b9832cc84c5b12b48847" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Prime DAO.</a></p>
<p>With this partnership, we want to build tooling that GitcoinDAO uses and closely work with GitcoinDAO to improve our platform in a way that specifically serves the needs of the DAO as well as Gitcoin funded projects.</p>
<p>We also want to help those in Kernel better collaborate on their projects since Wonder was actually started in KB4. Specifically, this would be tooling that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helps onboard new contributors and gives context to work that needs to be done in the GitcoinDAO</li>
<li>Makes it easier to pay Gitcoin contributors for tasks/bounties and through retroactive/recurring payments</li>
<li>Sets up more nuanced permissioning and token gating around who can create/review tasks</li>
<li>Helps create better task workflows within the DAO across the different working groups</li>
<li>Enables contributors to build up their web3/on chain profile (we‚Äôre part of <a href="https://daostar.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">DAOStar</a> where we help build standards around credentialing).</li>
<li>Helps Kernel fellows build their projects in public and invite other fellows to collaborate on those projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, 1% of our treasury will also be dedicated towards <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-aqueduct/9684,">aqueduct</a> to help improve the aqueduct technology as well as to ensure part of the funding of Wonder projects flows back into the Gitcoin ecosystem.</p>
<p>This is why we think this is more of a partnership, not an investment. Happy to attend the Steward‚Äôs meeting or set up a separate call/meeting to discuss more!</p>

<p>Reading through this post it sounds more like an bet than a partnership and it is complete news to me that Gitcoin is in the business of making bets.</p>
<p>I think we have to discuss this on the stewards call this Thursday. Will ping in the channel to make sure it is in the agenda.</p>

            <p>Let me say, I tried to start a similar product with the Swarm City team in 2018 called <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/ethkan-project-management-and-funding-bb829d5a0286" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">ETHkan</a> and am a big fan of what Wonder is doing! I also really like <a href="https://twitter.com/deworkxyz" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Dework</a> and would love to personally support any and every project that is integrating the Kanban approach with web3 tooling. Very needed!</p>
<p>That said, 50k GTC is a lot of money, more than most working groups get, and the convo in this thread feels like trying to justify throwing money to our friends more than it feels like this is an awesome opportunity that we should go out on a limb to support, so I am going to vote AGAINST to help get a discussion going and reserve my right to change my after the Stewards Council meeting.</p>
<p>My biggest issue is understanding if being part of this is in scope of Gitcoin DAO? If so, thats cool, and we should get a group together around it, and it‚Äôs not a bad move, Metacartel and ETHDenver do this sort of work for their ecosystem incubating Kernal projects could be an awesome move towards making Gitcoin DAO regenerative while also supporting the ecosystem‚Ä¶ but I doubt making a full DAO vote for every move would be the way to go for that.</p>
<p>So yeah‚Ä¶ I am on vacation this week but will try hard to make the 8am (my time) Stewards Call on Thursday to better understand this, and I might change my vote to ‚ÄúFor.‚Äù</p>

            <p>I just read the thread, and for the first time as an occasional GD voter, I‚Äôm leaning towards voting against the majority here.<br>
There are many positive aspects to this partnership, very well articulated by <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/andros">@andros</a>. I acknowledge all of the pros, I‚Äôm just not convinced enough that they balance the cons.</p>
<p>As mentioned by <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/linda">@linda</a>, funding early-stage projects is a different activity than treasury diversification. A token swap can have other purposes, like solidifying an incubation process or expanding an existing partnership. As many people mentioned here, GD doesn‚Äôt have processes in place to incubate early-stage projects (while Gitcoin has a long history of funding such projects through grants). Unless I missed it, it has never been an approved strategy with associated policy, structure, and budget. I understand and approve of the usefulness of having meta-delegates, but it sounds like a rushed and ad hoc measure that covers only a small part of what such activity would entail.</p>
<p>My main concern is that the proposal would set apart Wonder from other projects supported by grants (or not supported at all). There are so many new open source projects for DAO tooling right now (Dework, Charmverse, Otterspace, Crew3, Station, etc.). I‚Äôm concerned about the unintended and unforeseen consequences that may result from forming a special relationship with one of them without the justification of an existing and successful partnership, or the existence of a seed investment program.</p>

            <p>I‚Äôm supportive of the new 50k GTC revised amount.</p>
<ul>
<li>It seems Wonder is doing good work and would be a positive partnership for Gitcoin</li>
<li>I was initially hesitant about the 100k GTC amount, especially since at the time GTC was at $8. An $800k early-stage token swap didn‚Äôt really seem to me what Gitcoin DAO should be focused on directing funds to. A smaller amount to foster long term collaboration is something I can be supportive of though</li>
<li>I think in anticipation of future similar proposals, it‚Äôs worth Stewards discussing how we feel about Gitcoin DAO directing treasury funds into early-stage projects as this feels different to me than standard treasury diversification (moving some funds into more stable or liquid assets)</li>
<li>I think it‚Äôs also worth a discussion among Stewards on meta-governance if we have the proper structures/processes in place for it and if this is what we want to dedicate resources to. Thanks <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/pop">@Pop</a> for offering to be the meta-delegate in the case of Wonder!</li>

            <p>Thanks for clearing that up. I liked the green flag detail, but you‚Äôre right about the negative connotation of the word ‚Äúred flag‚Äù, it‚Äôs an interesting point.</p>
<p>I would personally prefer to see gitcoin invest in products that we can test ourselves and to buy tokens that can be independently valued by the market. But it seems that those who have actually seen the product and have some way to evaluate the value of the promised tokens are more excited, which is definitely a good sign.</p>

            <p>Based on my conversations with people from Kernel and our team, I am satisfied with the answers given.</p>
<p>I am still making up my mind, but leaning towards support. I‚Äôd like to see projects go from Hackathons, to grants, to kernel, to partners. This is an exciting opportunity.</p>
<p>The aqueduct will set a great precedent as well. While I am still unsure if we should be investing in early stage products AND I have reservations around not having any sort of comparison to the overall budget and treasury of the DAO, I am hesitantly supportive at this point.</p>

I think it does require more answers before I‚Äôm ready to support.</p>
<p>Decentralizing our treasury, or risk, should be done with a portfolio mentality and this proposal doesn‚Äôt take that into account.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd like to know how much of the treasury we are supposed to spend on this tool we have not used. Why is that allocation the proper allocation for our treasury diversification plans? Why does Gitcoin want governance responsibility for Wonder?</p>

            <p>First, congratulations for Wonder team on the project and I hope you a lot of success. DAO toolings are definitely super needed and I hope we can see more of them in the future.</p>
<p>Having said that, here are some weird red flags for me:</p>
<p><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/cn.png?v=12" title=":cn:" class="emoji" alt=":cn:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> You are asking $800k dollars to be invested in a token that doesn‚Äôt exist yet. We have no way to properly know how to define the market price of such token and I don‚Äôt think Gitcoin should be in such early stages of buying pre-market tokens. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a white paper somewhere that defines how the token governance will work, but until you have it live on main net, these are no guarantees</p>
<p><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/vietnam.png?v=12" title=":vietnam:" class="emoji" alt=":vietnam:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> The project page has no links to the working app. In fact the only two links on the project page are one asking my phone number to be on the ‚Äúwaitlist‚Äù and another to join the discord. Why are you collecting phone numbers and not addresses? Are doing some analytics on phone numbers? I have bad associations with phone numbers and crypto projects: they remind me of stolen SIM cards, 2fa hacks, phone spams, country blocking etc. I find that GitHub and twitter should be much better tools for sybil protection.</p>
<p><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/tr.png?v=12" title=":tr:" class="emoji" alt=":tr:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> It seems you have a private beta. I‚Äôve even seen some videos on YouTube of a working product. But I am extremely skeptical of projects that I haven‚Äôt used, as there are tons of little details that make or break the experience. The fact that the project seems huge and complicated doesn‚Äôt help my fears. I work for ENS DAO and was recently considering using Colony as a tool for our working groups: instead of asking the DAO to put money, I set up my own colony, with my own funds and started paying people out of it. My experience was a bit turn off and I had to shut down the project and will wait a few more months before judging if it‚Äôs a good tool for ENS. Same here: I don‚Äôt know if Wonder is a good tool for Gitcoin and believe we should test before committing such large amounts of money.</p>
<p><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/morocco.png?v=12" title=":morocco:" class="emoji" alt=":morocco:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> No GitHub. Where‚Äôs the project? Sure, maybe you want to have a limited amount of users in your private beta not to overload your servers with early success. But why can‚Äôt I fork and run it on my own? Are you afraid someone will steal your ideas (<img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/samoa.png?v=12" title=":samoa:" class="emoji" alt=":samoa:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/denmark.png?v=12" title=":denmark:" class="emoji" alt=":denmark:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/switzerland.png?v=12" title=":switzerland:" class="emoji" alt=":switzerland:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">!)?</p>
<p>So in short:</p>
<ul>
<li>If this is an investment proposal, I don‚Äôt believe Gitcoin is an early stage investment firm and we don‚Äôt have the tools to judge the investment potential of pre-launch tokens.</li>
<li>If this is a collaboration proposal, I don‚Äôt see how we can commit to use your tools if they are not accessible for everyone to use</li>
<li>If this is about supporting DAO toolings, then I don‚Äôt see any evidence that your code is open source which would be a requirement for me.</li>
