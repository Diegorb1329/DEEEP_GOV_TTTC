S17 Proposal DAO Ops Budget Request - Integrated
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s17-proposal-dao-ops-budget-request-integrated/12741
    *Original Draft: February 1, 2023*
*Updated Post: February 13, 2023*

## Integrated DAO Operations Budget Proposal

**S17 will be the last season that DAO Operations functions as a formal workstream.** As such, the following post describes how we prepare the DAO to function without a core operations workstream in S18.

In preparing this integrated proposal, we ran several scenarios that we ultimately decided were unrealistic based on 1) feedback from stewards and 2) how it would impact DAO contributors. So the following post will not discuss various scenarios. Instead, this post will focus on what we think is the most realistic alternative to our original S17 budget proposal. We believe this proposal is responsive to the expressed desire to see all teams reorganize this season, while minimizing disruption ahead of the launch event and next grants round.

DAO Operations will wind down or hand off its initiatives over the next 10 weeks. During that time, we’ll prioritize the following work:

1. Setting DAO leadership up for successful project-based governance initiatives
2. Ensuring a soft landing for the Support squad as they transition to Product teams 
3. Facilitating the team retreat at the end of February
4. Clean bookkeeping and tooling closeout or handoff.

## Essential Intent

Our revised S17 priorities are focused on the following intents:

* Protocol Growth + Adoption
* Program Success
* DAO Organization

## Amount

**DAO Operations is requesting nothing from the DAO treasury this season.** Instead, we plan to use the reserves and underspent S16 budget available to us in our multisig to meet our S17 commitments. To facilitate this, we will convert most of our funds to stables.

This assumes that the Foundation will pay for approximately $35,000 of the Team Retreat (February 24-27, 2023). It also assumes that:

* CSDO may fund Steward Council remunerations through its multisig and 
* Workstreams will fund approved professional development during S17*.

**Note: As of the date of this post, there is approximately $9,500 in professional development funding approved by workstream leadership.*

Any funds remaining at the end of the season will be reimbursed to the Foundation on or before April 30.

## Preparing the DAO for Nimbler Operations
We recognize that the teams that comprise Gitcoin have become more agile and self-sufficient. Ideally, removing centralized management of certain systems and processes will allow these teams to move faster and with  greater autonomy.  Those initiatives that are still managed by DAO Operations (e.g. professional development, steward engagement & management, OpSec, discord management, hiring, etc.) can be decentralized or decommissioned with a few months of runway. 

As described in the introduction above, we will refocus our efforts in S17 and make immediate changes to the team’s composition to streamline handovers and closeouts. Five contributors will end their service to the DAO on February 28. Professional development, governance tooling, and future consulting funding are removed from this budget.

# Conclusion

As the DAO sets a new vision and course for the protocol work to come, we want to thank the DAO Ops contributors for their hard work and all that they built and maintained over the past few seasons.

We believe that when a core operations practice is working well, it functions in service of an organization's vision and business strategy. It's with gratitude that we close out our final season recognizing that everyone involved in operations showed a relentless commitment to staying nimble and solving problems. It's because of this hard work that the DAO can evolve its operating system.  For that, we can't thank them enough and we hope a number of our super talented contributors can find new roles during our last season. 

Finally, we want to thank DAO Stewards for their constructive feedback. Since we are no longer requesting funding in S17, **we propose that this budget not go to Snapshot vote, unless Stewards feel strongly that components of our refined scope should be voted on**. Please let us know in the comments below.

            <p>Hey Kris. Thanks for your answers. The following isn’t a critique on this budget, but is important to mention just as a record of where the DAO is today:</p>
<p>For transparency purposes, the top stewards (by voting power) are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kevin.olsen">@kevin.olsen</a> (core contributor)</li>
<li>
<a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/j9leger">@J9leger</a> (core contributor)</li>
<li>
<a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle">@kyle</a> (core contributor)</li>
<li>Austin Griffith (doesn’t really vote)</li>
<li>
<a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/linda">@linda</a> (not really sure, but not in core. early investor?)</li>
<li>
<a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/griff">@griff</a> (an advisor/community member)</li>
</ol>
<p>The fact that it takes a handful of stewards to create such a large restructure in a budget proposal is a testament to where we are right now. I think it’s important to be transparent that, as it stands right now, this process is not community driven on the decision nor execution layer (although there is a lot of community input through discussion and social layers). Perhaps this fact is good. These stewards are very mission-aligned and perhaps serve as good guardrails for us to progressively decentralize. But the evolution of this DAO Ops budget is an important snapshot of how power and influence (both social and voting) works to produce decision within Gitcoin.</p>

<p>There is not a whole lot you’re missing here. You see above that 3 of our 4 top delegated Stewards would be voting no. Through a conversation on Friday with Kyle we heard Kevin would also be voting no, which means 4/4. We also heard that no matter what changes we made the vote would be no, if it did not include dissolving the workstream. So that’s what we did.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the feedback. More coming soon!</p>

            <p>Alright. It seems like we’re rolling the dice here. I’m going to vote no because I think DAO Ops is important and defunding it completely without a clear path forward seems wrong, but I also am confident that we will be able to build back better. Thank you for your timely and clear responses kris. If you and <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/shawn16400">@shawn16400</a> need an extra pair of eyes or need a hand on governance work at all please let me know. Shawn knows but I am always looking to help in that department. Thank you.</p>
<p>Also, was there an off-forum conversation that spurred on the new defunded DAO Ops budget proposal? I know there was a lot of dissonance in the forum, but I find it hard to believe that this alone convinced DAO Ops to propose a new, unfunded budget request. In the spirit of transparency, I think it’d be beneficial for the community to know how we got from the old request to the updated one.</p>

<p>We will probably transition some of the ongoing (and often invisible) tasks into separate RFPs in S18. We use S17 to get us ready for this in S18. The CSDO Digest will continue to be sent by <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kylejensen">@kylejensen</a> for this upcoming season, together with scribing the various meetings. We’ll try to ‘package’ some of the fantastic work he does into a request for funding for the next season.</p>

<p>I share your concerns and personally also worry about the scenario you describe. Our top priority for this season is to avoid going into S18 without a clear plan for Governance. <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/shawn16400">@shawn16400</a> and myself will work on building a clear proposal here in the coming months, and bring this both to CSDO and the Stewards. Even with changes to the process, I imagine here as well for S18 an RFP, unless CSDO decides we drastically limit the role of Stewards in the upcoming seasons, and actually decide to function in a more centralized way for the time being. So, a lot to figure out, but we will come up with a plan, just give us a few days to find our balance again, as the decision to not fund DAO Ops is not a decision by DAO Ops, it is a decision by the Stewards who have the most tokens delegated to them.</p>

            <p>I have abstained from voting. I have been waffling on and off about voting “yes” to this new proposal (of not funding DAO Ops this season). I do think that Gitcoin’s operations need an overhaul and, from what I’ve experienced these past few seasons at CSDO, there seems to be burnout around these conversations by much of the leadership team.</p>
<p>I suspect it’s because the decisions we’re trying to make collectively are not directly and frequently aligned to overarching organizational goals and we lose sight on why and how structures can serve us or hinder us season over season.<br>
Questions like: How does our budgeting process serve or detract from what we’re trying to achieve as an org? How is our org structure serving the needs of our business goals? What functions should be consistently funded vs. project-based?</p>
<p>I have not seen questions like these surfaced by DAO Ops and I think we will find that these kind of unanswered questions will continue to remain pain points but now there will be no one accountable to solve them.</p>
<p>This move feels risky to me but I’m also willing to set us loose and see what happens. I’m cautiously optimistic that we can all rally together to make it work and am hoping that in Denver we can lay the foundations for a more thoughtful reorientation…</p>

            <p>I am quite surprised to learn that we will no longer have a DAO Ops workstream in future seasons. I think this is a penny-wise but pound-foolish decision.</p>
<p>I fully understand and share the frustrations w/ the DAO’s current Governance/budgeting process and agree it needs to be fixed. The issue is, these are huge problems and solving them isn’t something that happens in 3-6 months. as kris states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Operating a DAO is tough, as DAOs are a new beast and we need to find answers to some of these questions collectively - this is not something just Gitcoin is struggling with, all DAOs are. As owocki mentioned yesterday, ‘solving’ governance is probably as hard as sybil resistance. I’d even argue it’s much harder</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Blaming DAO Ops for not solving these problems is unfair and cancelling the workstream seems like the wrong approach to solving the problems IMO. Especially when this is something they are actively working on. I think a more reasonable approach would be to get DAO Ops to commit to trying X number of new governance experiments next season etc until we start to find better governance “product market fit.”</p>
<p>There are many things that DAO Ops is doing a great at and I don’t think we are giving enough value to those tasks. I suspect many DAO contributors are going to feel the pain of not having the DAO Ops team when all of the sudden no one is owning these tasks. Good operations are like the air we breathe, easy to take for granted when they are working well, but when they aren’t, we feel their absence acutely.</p>

<p><strong>we propose that this budget not go to Snapshot vote, unless Stewards feel strongly that components of our refined scope should be voted on</strong>. Please let us know in the comments below.</p>

</aside>
<p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/jodi_gitcoindao">@Jodi_GitcoinDAO</a>  thanks for all the time and energy you put into this proposal.  I am in this particular workstream so I am refraining from commenting on the proposal itself.</p>
<p>Related to the ratification of this proposal and speaking from a governance perspective, I think we need to take this to a vote on snapshot.<br>
Why?</p>
<ol>
<li>It allows for the dissonant votes to be cast - those who disagree.</li>
<li>An official vote eliminates/reduces the risk of later noise related to “unilateral decisions”.</li>
<li>The vote authorizes reserve spending on projects vs. compensating for GTC fluctuations (the original intent of reserves)</li>
<li>A vote hardens spending proposals under the “Amount” section</li>
<li>A vote keeps the decision process consistent - introducing this precedent allows for future cases to argue for circumventing the vote.</li>
</ol>
<p>With no funds changing wallets, I do not see a need a Tally vote, just the snapshot.</p>
<p>I might be shooting myself in the foot, but from a principled governance position, this is what I think should happen.</p>

            <p>Who will be in charge of the CSDO digest? What about other org-wide operations requirements?</p>
<p>I definitely agree that our governance model should be revisited from a first principles perspective. However, even setting that up will take effort. Who will undergo that effort if we don’t have a place for it?</p>
<p>My concerns include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Governance evaporates into the ether. Occasional ideas pop up on the forum, but none of them are executed</li>
<li>The steward program currently in place remains in place, and since no one is officially in charge of managing it, the program deteriorates in effectiveness over time</li>
<li>After some seasons, someone wields their token-power in an unpopular way, and now we try to put a big band-aid on a problem we should have thoughtfully considered seasons earlier</li>
<li>After many seasons, Gitcoin slowly devolves into what is essentially a digital, stock corporation. Our primary concerns become about increasing the price of GTC, rather than fulfilling the mission</li>

<p>I am supportive of the new path, very grateful for the hard work to get us here… and also immensely glad we still get to have folks at the retreat.</p>
<p>If the facilitation sessions are not shaping up to be great, perhaps we can recoup those funds and have a couple of us host the team with sessions instead?</p>
<p>I don’t see a need to go to a vote personally.</p>

</aside>
<p>CSDO has rotating facilitation and this change in DAO Ops will likely not impact that dramatically.</p>
<p>Governance is something I would love to see some thought put into… perhaps via proposal to fund experiments in the future. IMO we are finding the governance models that were developed and rolled out during the bull market, with lots of fever for what we were doing, are not serving us today. Times are different and we have not started from first principles on what we want to accomplish with governance now that multiple protocols are live, “always on” development is occurring, and we want to encourage emergent work from the DAO. this is just my .02 gwei.</p>

            <p>For the new integrated post:</p>
<p>It looks like from this we’re moving in the direction of workstreams becoming more autonomous, with operations being embedded in each product team, as opposed to a seaparate DAO-wide operations team. However, there are still some unavoidable DAO-wide operations requirements: CSDO and community governance. Where will these live?</p>

            <p>For the record, I support this budget, but I also support it being a last season for the workstream.</p>
<p>I think Governance should likely be it’s own “thin” workstream. Contributor support such as People Ops &amp; Hiring might be a part of this if we frame it as “Stakeholder Relations” serving contributors, stewards, &amp; token holders.</p>

<p>our support function is immensely important during our alpha rounds, but it should likely live within each respective protocol team to ensure they are truly internalizing the feedback they receive.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m not sure how this would work considering the communication flow for user support deals with inbound requests. It would be a huge change to have support saying, “I’m the Passport support, let me get you the Program Manager support”. Perhaps this could be mitigated by moving from real-time support to scheduled support with a chatbot submitting requests to the proper channels. There would likely need to be at least 1-2 full time people as a hub to the product team support spokes.</p>

<p>I would like to see this budget pass so we can jointly align on a path forward in person at EthDenver. However, I do see that a No vote isn’t a no to this workstream this season, but could also be a request to rework this budget to lower its cost, clarify deliverables, or commit to future structural change. For this reason, <em><strong>I’d urge any stewards planning to vote no, to directly address what requirements you have for an acceptable update to this proposal.</strong></em></p>

            <p>I have been really conflicted on how to approach DAO Ops budget this season. I feel DAO ops has struggled to unlock its secret powers. <strong>I am partially responsible for this and it kills me as I love each of these people immensely.</strong></p>
<p>So much of what Griff has mentioned resonates, and I am finding myself wanting to double down on “<a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s17-musing-gitcoins-most-important-thing/12875">the most important thing</a>.”</p>
<p>I will likely vote no on this budget this season and take option 3.</p>
<p>One alternative might be to have a commitment to fund DAO Ops in S17 with the expectation there is no DAO Ops in S18 (ie, the current path FDD is on). The critical functions can be moved to other workstreams, or they can be dropped. ie, our support function is immensely important during our alpha rounds, but it should likely live within each respective protocol team to ensure they are truly internalizing the feedback they receive. Governance work likely needs a revamp to be more nimble and “always on.” I have some idea on how that might work, but it will be scrappy.</p>
