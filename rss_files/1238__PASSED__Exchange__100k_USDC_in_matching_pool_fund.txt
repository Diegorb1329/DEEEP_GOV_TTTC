    ### Title: [GCP-00x] - Exchange $100k USDC in matching pool funds for $100k Glo Dollar
Author: Garm Lucassen, CTO of Glo Dollar 

Version 2.0, a revision to the previously [posted v1.0](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-diversify-gitcoin-stablecoin-holdings-by-exchanging-usdc-for-glo-dollars/16398/28)

### Summary

We propose that Gitcoin exchange 100k of its matching pool USDC for 100k Glo Dollars, the stablecoin that helps end extreme poverty, and plan to hold the Glo Dollars for at least 12 months.

Doing so has two benefits:

1. Enable Gitcoin’s matching funds to have additional impact through Glo Dollar’s basic income funding mechanism that reduces extreme poverty
2. Support the development of an alternative US regulated stablecoin that benefits the public and the broader crypto ecosystem, instead of a few shareholders

The Gitcoin matching pool currently holds a little over [$13 million of assets](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0xde21f729137c5af1b01d73af1dc21effa2b8a0d6). Exchanging $100k for Glo Dollars would mean swapping approximately 0.7% of the matching pool funds for an equivalent amount of Glo Dollars.

### The Case to Embrace Glo Dollar

Glo Dollar is the stablecoin that enables holders to help end extreme poverty, without donating anything.

Glo Dollar is US regulated and 1:1 backed by a reserve of cash and US Treasuries. When the Glo Foundation receives revenue from the reserve, they donate it to [GiveDirectly](https://www.glodollar.org/articles/givedirectly)’s basic income programs that lift people out of extreme poverty. (See [this article](https://www.glodollar.org/articles/why-glo-foundation-donates-to-givedirectly) for why we donate to GiveDirectly.)

At scale, we expect every [$20,000 of Glo Dollar market cap](https://www.glodollar.org/articles/from-bootstrap-to-high-impact) to lift 1 person out of extreme poverty. At [Tether’s current market cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/), that corresponds to lifting four million people out of extreme poverty. Even at smaller caps, this amounts to millions of dollars of money generated for GiveDirectly.

By choosing to put some of its treasury into Glo Dollar, Gitcoin can [embed philanthropy](https://www.glodollar.org/articles/embedded-philanthropy) into its everyday operations and leverage Gitcoin’s matching pool funds as an additional tool for funding public good creation. We think choosing Glo Dollar as one of the stablecoins in its treasury aligns with Gitcoin’s stated mission to build and fund digital public goods. Though not digital, a global basic income for anyone who falls below the extreme poverty line [can be considered](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0313592622000856) an important public good. Glo Dollar is a donation-independent funding mechanism that can support such a basic income perpetually and at scale. Anyone holding Glo Dollars contributes to this funding mechanism at no cost. Affecting 700 million people, extreme poverty is a highly costly problem in terms of human potential and wellbeing, but [it is solvable through unconditional cash transfers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DUlYQTrsOs). The bottleneck for these programs is funding.

As a final consideration: the incumbent stablecoins already function as a public good, yet are managed by for-profit entities incentivized to choose the benefit of shareholders over the benefit of the ecosystem. Even if you do not hold USDC or USDT yourself, most of DeFi runs on them under the hood. It’s time the ecosystem adopts a stablecoin that is managed as a public good.

Glo Dollar previously participated in Gitcoin’s [Web3 Open Source Software round](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/10/0x8de918f0163b2021839a8d84954dd7e8e151326d/0x8de918f0163b2021839a8d84954dd7e8e151326d-133) and [metacrisis funding round](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/1/0x8aa06b3b8cac2970857f4e0fd78f21dc01aade94/0x8aa06b3b8cac2970857f4e0fd78f21dc01aade94-25). Check out the [Glo Dollar website ](https://www.glodollar.org/)for more information on everything you might want to know about Glo Dollar, such as [how Glo Dollar works](https://www.glodollar.org/articles/how-glo-works) and [how we issue Glo Dollars](https://www.glodollar.org/articles/brale-and-the-glo-foundation) in a regulatory compliant manner by partnering with [Brale](https://brale.xyz/).

### Proposal

We propose that the Gitcoin matching funds pool exchange $100,000 in USDC for Glo Dollar and commit to holding the Glo Dollars for a period of 12 months.

To execute upon this effort, we propose to carry out these steps:

1. Appoint a DAO coordinator that collaborates with the Glo Dollar team on this proposal
2. Allocate $100,000 USDC to a matching pool diversification wallet address
3. Swap USDC for Glo Dollar using Uniswap or an OTC desk
4. Transfer exchanged Glo Dollar to Gitcoin’s matching pool multisig wallet
5. Co-market the completion of diversification efforts with the Gitcoin community and the broader world
6. After 12 months, evaluate whether to exchange the Glo Dollars back to USDC or to continue to hold on to Glo Dollars for an extended period of time

Glo Dollars are always exchangeable 1:1 for USDC with our issuing partner [Brale](https://brale.xyz/), should the need arise to revert this position sooner than 12 months.

### Vote

We propose the vote to be a yes / no vote.
Swap $100,000 USDC in the matching pool funds for $100,000 Glo Dollars, or do not swap.
1 - Yes to swap $100k USDC for Glo Dollars
2 - No do not swap USDC for Glo Dollars

Our objective is for everyone to prosper through this proposal: Gitcoin, Glo Dollar, and, most significantly, the 700 million individuals living in extreme poverty.

            <p>Thanks for that thorough update <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle">@kyle</a> - we’re super excited this got finalized and that Gitcoin is joining the Glo Consortium. Onwards and upwards <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> !</p>
<p>A big thank you to everyone for voting, supporting, sharing feedback, and asking the tough questions. Your input greatly helped us to work toward a better proposal that’ll benefit both our communities.</p>
<p>With the swap completed, Gitcoin’s immediate impact is clear: with time, this $100,000 held in Glo Dollars is enough to lift 5 people out of extreme poverty.</p>
<p>But there’s a second –perhaps even more important– reason why Gitcoin joining our mission means a lot to us. Gitcoin is helping us to get the ball rolling. Spreading the word about Gitcoin holding Glo Dollars and joining the consortium has already resulted in an increase in inbound interest.</p>
<p>If you’d like to keep track of Glo’s trajectory, there’s a section right below the hero on our website <a href="http://glodollar.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">glodollar.org</a> showcasing the following: market cap, Glo holders, people lifted out of extreme poverty, and amount donated to GiveDirectly.</p>
<p>We’re already ruminating on the next steps in the Glo Dollar x Gitcoin journey and will share more about that soon. If you have any questions or ideas for further collaboration please feel free to reach out to me!</p>

<p>Concurrent with this exchange, Gitcoin has also joined the Glo Consortium. The Glo Consortium is a collective focused on harnessing the potential of Glo Dollar to address global challenges. By joining this consortium, Gitcoin:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expands its Ecosystem Presence: Enters a new collaborative space, broadening our ecosystem presence and engagement.</li>
<li>Holds Glo Dollars: Holds Glo Dollars as part of our treasury diversification, supporting Glo Dollar’s unique mechanism aimed at contributing to global social impact.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="future-updates-and-community-engagement-4" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#future-updates-and-community-engagement-4"></a>Future Updates and Community Engagement</h2>
<p>We’ll ensure the community is kept informed about any significant updates concerning our role in the Glo Consortium and our Glo Dollar holdings. Your input and engagement are invaluable in these strategic decisions. We’ll continue to provide updates, especially regarding the use of these funds in our treasury, and we’ll revisit our next steps with the Glo Dollars in the next 12 months, as outlined in the original proposal.</p>

</aside>
<p>I see on Coingecko the 24hr trade volume is ~$13k and the only two Uniswap markets have very low liquidity, selling &lt;$100k USDC would more than drain every LP. So using Uniswap currently isn’t an option (for the initial swap or a hypothetical future swap out). I do believe your partner will exchange them 1 to 1 for USDC, but if there was an active/efficient OTC market you’d expect there to be more people leveraging the 1:1 swaps to arbitrage or add to the LPs, given there does seem to be some small fluctuations above/below $1. I expect this initial $100k USDC swap from Gitcoin into Glo would have to be done through this one specific OTC desk yes? And that those funds will go towards providing liquidity for clients doing the opposite trade?</p>
<p>A few sites report the market cap is ~$1m, not sure if that’s accurate but if it is then Gitcoin would be acquiring 10% of the supply. Would either side be concerned with this?</p>

</aside>
<p>Are these two alternatives the only ones worth considering? Ie. is the expectation to buy, hold, and then either sell or hold forever? I think there could be some cool ways to utilize the token a bit more, for example paying out matching funds in Glo. Can create more of an ecosystem and utility to it - but I also would have some concerns about liquidity and large sell pressure (grant owners need to pay their bills and fund their projects).</p>
<p>I think this is a really interesting idea and would be a fun experiment if expanded a bit, but I do feel it would be “safer” to take on once Glo Dollar matures more. Either way snapshot vote has passed so excited to see where it goes. Still wanted to ask a few questions though to alleviate any areas of concern.</p>

<p>I agree that their public website isn’t best in class, although I disagree that it doesn’t withstand <em>any</em> scrutiny. On their website you find their NMLS ID (<span class="hashtag-raw">#2376957</span>) with which you can verify their money transmitter licenses: <a href="https://www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org/EntityDetails.aspx/COMPANY/2376957" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org/EntityDetails.aspx/COMPANY/2376957</a>. Money transmitter licenses have to be obtained on a state-by-state basis, i.e. Brale went to tens of separate diligence processes (a multi-million dollar investment).</p>
<p>The MTLs require Brale to have recurring audits from third party firms which are reviewed by state regulators. This includes the reserve backing of issued stablecoins. It also includes Brale’s own financial condition, compliance audit, penetration testing, SOC2 audit, and smart contract audit. So Brale is definitely regulated, and you can verify this yourself.</p>

<p>They are spread across multiple US financial institutions. Brale does not publicly disclose them (makes sense, as most US financial institutions avoid crypto associations these days), but the Glo Foundation knows them. It is a diversified set of robust institutions, and one of the key reasons we’re working with Brale.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering how Brale is able to do this, it’s useful to consider the reputable team. Brale is headquartered in Des Moines, IA where the team has been building fintech products for more than a decade. CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bpmilne/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Ben Milne</a> previously founded Dwolla, a company that facilitates over $50B in transaction volume annually. He also served as advisor to a prominent US government financial agency and was a board member at a regional bank.

<p>Circle issues USDC under the cover of the same Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs) as Brale.xyz issues USDGLO. Both issuers back their stablecoins with cash and short duration US Treasuries and cash equivalents (think money market funds holding short term treasuries). As far as where reserve funds are held, Brale holds reserves across several US financial institutions while Circle’s reserves are heavily concentrated in BlackRock and Bank of New York Melon.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I looked into Brale.xyz, and there are no real details beyond a sort of spiffy website that doesn’t withstand any scrutiny.  Are you just trusting that Brale is legitimate and bringing up Circle’s reliance on two of the largest firms as somehow being a negative to USDC?  Where are the reserves held, and how do you know they are indeed there?</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>Glo Dollar is US regulated and 1:1 backed by a reserve of cash and US Treasuries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is there any proof of this assertion?  Who is holding these reserve assets?  Seems like a great idea, but are we all just blindly trusting that the assets are even there?  In this environment it isn’t exactly easy to have an actual non-sketchy financial institution holding Treasuries and USD for stablecoin reserves…</p>

            <p>Regretfully, I voted no on this proposal. I think the project is great and I’m definitely personally values-aligned!! Seeing the back and forth on this proposal, it feels like there are still a few loose ends of how this proposal might explicitly benefit the DAO’s goals and what resources are needed to make this initiative successful.</p>
<p>Happy to change my mind but I would want to understand what exact resourcing would be needed on our side to make this successful. If it’s as simple as <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ccerv1">@ccerv1</a> is stating then I could be a “yes” but the more lift needed from us, the more I’d like it to align to our roadmap.</p>

</aside>
<p>I actually didn’t notice that either. I’m not for this - we are constantly hit up by other orgs looking to use Gitcoin’s legitimacy to promote their project. As fantastic of a project Glo Dollar is, imo this is more of that same behaviour.</p>
<p>I’d be open to abstaining or voting yes if this is can be removed. Glo dollar can promote this as much as they want, but the marketing team should stay 100% focused on their commitments outlined in the <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-mmm-s20-budget-request/16909">S20 Budget Request</a> and should not be taking on requests like this (it also doesn’t specify the amount of co-marketing which is problematic as well since the scope is undefined). Sorry for bringing this up last minute - only just noticed now.</p>

            <p>I am voting YES on this proposal. I shared some comments on the <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-diversify-gitcoin-stablecoin-holdings-by-exchanging-usdc-for-glo-dollars/16398/9">original proposal</a>. My concerns were (mostly) addressed via the revised proposal and some of the other commentary here.</p>
<p>Is this on Gitcoin’s critical path? No. Is it the type of thing we should be spilling lots of ink over on governance forums? No. But those are sunk costs. To implement the proposal is just a few transactions.</p>
<p>I want this project to succeed. I want to see more stablecoin projects do cool things with their yield. And I think GiveDirectly is a great cause to support. So that’s why I’m voting yes.</p>

            <p>I really appreciate the thoughtfulness that’s gone into this thread and willingness to revise. I’m also a big fan of what you’re building! I am still planning to vote no on the proposal and am signaling this publicly since I currently have not-insubstantial voting power (600k gtc i think.)</p>
<p>Especially as we get ready for GG19, I am noticing a TON of coordination and ops overhead at Gitcoin. This feels like an initiative that adds to that operational overhead (eg - will require product support, grantee education, etc) without substantially impacting our Essential Intents.</p>
<p>That said, if the proposal passes I will gladly support with needed in-product allowlisting, etc.</p>

            <p>I think the aim of the proposal and the rethinking of the role of stables in general is very well aligned with Gitcoin’s mission, though unconventional compared with treasury + matching pool management in the past.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/garm">@garm</a> - would be great to have some more context if Glo is approaching other DAO’s/grants programs with similar proposition, or if this is planned as a bit of a pilot?</p>
<p>Overall - I’m personally in support and excited about the future the Glo team is building.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the revisions here. I would vote yes on this in the current form. It feels like it is not without risk, but that the risk is fairly contained and worth the investment to show our support for the initiative.</p>
<p>I would be happy to help partner so that we don’t see slippage and can coordinate the transfer of USDC to GLO, if that is necessary.</p>

            <p>Thanks for taking the time to draft a response! Good to know Glo dollar would take on swapping costs &amp; have used gitcoin products before</p>

<p>Gitcoin will be able to leverage this in their own marketing, so it’s not purely a charitable endeavor</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m still not fully convinced by this part - if for whatever reason Glo dollar loses its peg in the future, the reputational backlash of gitcoins endorsement would outweigh any short term marketing benefit</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Moreover, right now the yield is being donated to Circle’s shareholders instead.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Some part of this yield would be going to Brale’s shareholders too, is that correct? Would be curious if you can dive deeper into the numbers here of how much goes to them versus GiveDirectly.</p>
<p>Overall i appreciate Glo Dollar’s intent and would be more sympathetic if their approach was more flexible than only GiveDirectly , such as contributing a part of the yield to our matching funds. As it stands the reputational risk of gitcoin’s endorsement of an unproven stablecoin and the danger of losing our assets in case of a de-peg is not worth the questionable marketing benefits we obtain.</p>
