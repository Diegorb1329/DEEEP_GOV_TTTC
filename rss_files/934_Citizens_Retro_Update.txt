    # Citizens Retro Update

This is to provide an update to the Citizens Grants Program, specifically Citizens Retro #4. As outlined in [this post](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-citizens-retro-4-update/19004), some changes are underway to the Retro round. **Citizen Grants as a whole is currently undergoing review, with a potential major redesign.**

Given our strategic shifts to make the Gitcoin 2.0 vision a reality, we are currently redesigning the program from first-principles (with the help of the Grants Program Canvas!) so that we can ensure it further aligns to our goals and creates more clarity for community members on where their contributions will create the most impact in the Gitcoin Ecosystem. The current working group consists of myself (@MathildaDV) @owocki, @deltajuliet, @Viriya, @CoachJonathan, consulting @sejalrekhan.

Other notes worth mentioning:

* Moving forward, I‚Äôll be taking the lead on the Citizens Retro. We feel that an important next step in the evolution of this program is to appoint a high-context contributor to drive and hold the vision for the program for the time being.
* **We are still hiring!** I will share a job description for a full-time grants coordinator position via [my Twitter very soon](https://x.com/mathildawrites) (so if you‚Äôre interested in getting involved, please keep an eye out!). All candidates that have applied to the Citizens Retro will still be considered for this new position.
* I would like to extend my gratitude and admiration to @krrisis, who has taken the lead on getting the Retro round to where it is today. It has been wonderful to see it grow into what it is, and I deeply appreciate Kris‚Äô hard work.

Continue to keep an eye out for exciting updates ahead! More details to follow.

<p>Hopefully following this strategy it will <strong>still</strong> be an inclusive program for all who consider themselves a citizen. whether they have received funding or not previously.</p>
<p>Essentially anyone who has supported, will be supporting, or continues to support the ecosystem.</p>

            <p>Thank you for sharing. It‚Äôs very nice that we are up to date with any new decisions. As a suggestion, the style that Charmverse has for milestones it‚Äôs incredible. Maybe we can take a look at this.</p>
