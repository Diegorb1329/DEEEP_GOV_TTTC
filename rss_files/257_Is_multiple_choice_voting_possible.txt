    We seem to be using snapshot.  Can it only do yes/no voting on proposals?

There are 5 Akita proposals in the [proposal discussion category](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/governance-proposals/5).

I would love to have the option to do [ranked choice voting](https://ballotpedia.org/Ranked-choice_voting_(RCV)).

Or since we like [quadratic voting, voice credits](https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/quadratic-voting/) :smiley:
