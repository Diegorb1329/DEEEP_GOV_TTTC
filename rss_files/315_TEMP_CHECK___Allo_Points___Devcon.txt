    # Allo Points - Devcon Launch 

As part of the Allo Devcon Launch, I think we should consider launching a website entitled "Allo Points".

## What are Allo Points?

Allo Points is a website that updates weekly and tracks those who are generating GMV on Allo. The more GMV an agent gets, the more points they get.

Ways to earn points:

1. Generate GMV (as a round operator)
2. Generate GMV (as a grantee)
3. Generate GMV (as a contributor)
4. Generate GMV (as a dev)
5. Generate GMV (as a L2)

This reinforces the community weekly for positive behavior.

Creating value which compounds over time.

## This is an opportunity to:

1. Track who is generating value in the Gitcoin community.
2. Get the Community generating more GMV to complement Grants Labs efforts.
3. Invite ex-Gitcoin ecosystem ppl to participate in our renaissance and send a signal to Ethereum ecosystem that Gitcoin is back.
4. Explore the points meta & airdrop meta and how it might converge with Allo designs one day.

## How

1. Regendata.xyz pipeline by Umar/Owocki. Architecture: [Click Here](https://www.figma.com/design/eQhRgnx6kgSybRF6ZDwjAY/Allo-Points?node-id=0-1&t=9zyk4GvUwJ1VNBuK-1)
2. Site coded by cristina.
3. Octavian designs it. Design: [Click Here](https://www.figma.com/design/eQhRgnx6kgSybRF6ZDwjAY/Allo-Points?node-id=0-1&t=9zyk4GvUwJ1VNBuK-1)

## Timeline

1. MVP app by early Sept
2. Shared to DAO contributors for review September.
3. Final tweaks in October.
4. Weekly updates every week thereafter

## Hazards:

1. Should the points ever translate into something more tangible?  Or is strategic ambiguity strategic here? What if we never do anything with the points?
2. We attract ppl to do extractive or negative behavior due to Goodharts Law.
3. Are points really the right lever? Are there other ways we can inspire engagement, reward users, and maintain security?

## Bonus Opportunities:

1. Does this plug in to $REGEN?
2. Give Disruption Joe credit for [this idea](https://x.com/DisruptionJoe/status/1805959610857038130).

TEMP CHECK - Allo Points - Devcon
Sov

            <p>I love this idea.</p>
<p>I was on a call just this morning with a service provider who was curious how to find all the current builds on Allo and see which of them has received traction in terms of the GMV amount allocated.</p>
