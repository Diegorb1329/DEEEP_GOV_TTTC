https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/3-layers-to-a-dao-to-dao-partnership/10657
    I keep getting pulled onto calls with DAOs who want to partner with Gitcoin.   I want to lay out how I think about these things + solicit feedback from the DAO.

IMO there are 3 layers to a DAO to DAO partnership.  They go in order from more casual to more serious (from less commitment to more commitment).

1. Social interoperability
2. Product/Technology interoperability
3. Governance Rights interoperability

More about these layers:

# 1. Social interoperability

In this stage, there are strong relationships being built between members of each DAO across-DAO.  DAO members might be invited to speak at Gitcoin events like [Schelling Point](https://schellingpoint.gitcoin.co/) or our Public Goods are Good twitter spaces, or DAO Vibes.  This is the relationship/rapport/trust building stage of of a DAO to DAO partnership.

# 2. Product/Technology interoperability

The product/technology interop stage is when the DAOs start to invest resources into seriously building [Practical Pluralism](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/practical-pluralism-essay-draft-req-for-feedback/10462/2) between the products of each system.

Examples of this I've seen at GitcoinDAO.
1. Gitcoin leverages [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/) or [BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/) or [Idena](https://www.idena.io/) for Gitcoin Grants
2. Gitcoin launches [a podcast on the bankless network](http://greenpill.party/).
3.   I'm sure there are many others.

# 3. Governance Rights interoperability

The Governance Rights interoperability stage is when the governance rights of each DAO is extended to the other DAO, likely via a [Mutual Grant](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/constructing-a-mutual-grants-committee/10347/7).

Past examples of this
1. Gitcoins incubation of [KERNEL](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/kernel-evolves-a-new-leaf-for-gitcoin-dao/9912).
2. Gitcoins mutual grant with [DeveloperDAO](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-partnership-mutual-grant-with-developer-dao/9217).
3. Gitcoins incubation of [dComipass](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-dcompass-season-13-budget-request/9794).

# Summary

One thing I think is really important about web3 is [Practical Pluralism](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/practical-pluralism-essay-draft-req-for-feedback/10462/2).  Instead of web2 companies elbowing out each other for market share, web3 networks of DAOs are fundamentally modular + interoperable.  I fantasize about a world in which the Ethereum ecosystem becomes a DAO of DAOs that all rises and falls together, building a beautiful world of immense utility from a diverse fauna of protocols that serve our shared mission.

Feedback welcome.

            <p>After the rough market conditions of 2022-2023, many token swaps, including the collaboration between PrimeDAO and Gitcoin, which I was personally connected to, didn‚Äôt realize their potential.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm optimistic about the DAO-to-DAO coordination topic regaining interest. We‚Äôre getting closer to a world where D2D collaboration will be net positive. One of the great examples is the co-funded Gitcoin Community Rounds, which aligns the interests of multiple ecosystems to achieve shared objectives.</p>
<p>Eager to explore what type of D2D collaborations are possible with the next iteration of Allo!</p>

            <p>I think it is to Gitcoin‚Äôs credit that it does not see itself in an adversarial relationship with other DAOs, but instead operates in a kind of curated collaboration. In order to differentiate the wider Web3 commons from the inherited economic structures of constant competition we need to have porous borders. As a Bankless listener I especially appreciate how your podcast has slotted in there because in my mind there is a shared ethos with the Bankless crew. So yes, it‚Äôs great and please keep it up!</p>
