https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/climate-coordination-network-ccn-the-future-of-the-climate-solutions-program/16777
    As recently summarized in the Gitcoin Governance Post ([link](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/update-climate-program-shell-turning-challenges-into-opportunities/16770)) by DeltaJuliet and the post ([link](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg19-outline-and-strategy/16682)) by Sov, the Climate Solutions Round will transition to being a decentralized Community Round in the upcoming GG19 scheduled to take place November 15-29, 2023.

Introducing the Climate Coordination Network (CCN). The new decentralized Climate Solutions Program will be managed by the Climate Coordination Network ‚Äî a global group composed of the former Gitcoin Climate Advisory team who have dedicated many hours to support the Climate Solutions Round over the past 18+ months. Since GR12, the Climate Solutions Round has enormously impacted the web3 Climate space. We have crowdfunded nearly $1M and distributed nearly $3.6M in funding to hundreds of projects.

Driven by the belief that climate action is the ultimate public good because climate change increasingly affects all of humanity, as well as a mission to accelerate climate action, the Climate Coordination Network is excited for the opportunity to take the Climate Solutions Program to the next level of effective and focused global impact. As an independently managed Community Round, the Climate Solutions Program will now be able to chart a more expansive course and explore new growth avenues, including becoming a legal entity, onboarding and networking new grantees from all over the world, and unlocking new funding mechanisms.

To our committed climate community around the globe: This transition will unlock new opportunities for collaboration to foster meaningful and sustainable climate action worldwide. You can look forward to closer communication and more ways to participate in the Climate Solutions Round operations in order to help navigate and shape our shared future.

To begin with, we are launching a new profile on Twitter (X): [@climate_program](https://twitter.com/climate_program) and will be hosting spaces soon to gather community input and ideas for the future of the Climate Solutions Round. Be sure to follow us so that you can stay updated on the latest developments including revised eligibility criteria and opportunities for involvement.

Our first request for community support is in forming an advisory team that can help guide us as we formalize our team and structure. We are looking for advisors representing different blockchain enabled climate solutions use cases and geographic areas to help advance the mission of the Network. Drop a note in the comments or reach out directly if you want to get involved.

Finally, we‚Äôd like to thank Gitcoin for its commitment to addressing global challenges such as climate change and for providing the technology ‚Äî e.g, Quadratic Funding, Allo, Grants Stack, Passport ‚Äî that will enable a successful transition to decentralized grant funding for climate solutions. We appreciate the support of Gitcoin and all its contributors and, in the words of Taiwan's Digital Minister Audrey Tang (and the beloved Star Trek series), our wish is that we all continue to work together to ‚Äúlive long and prosper.‚Äù 

Public Goods are Good.

            <p>So excited for the future of CCN and to continue experimenting with new funding mechanisms. When we bridge the gap between ‚Äúimpact = profit,‚Äù we empower more people to build, work, and fund climate solutions for a thriving planet <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>Happy to support with sustainable funding mechanism designs, Hypercert integration, dApp development, and product testing for real-world use cases.</p>

Climate Coordination Network (CCN) - The future of the Climate Solutions Program

            <p>Summary of the top 35 GG19 CCN projects by their total funds raised to date and some other tidbits.</p>
<p>This bucket (top 1/3rd) of projects declared a total of $7,217,372 before the round even started in their applications.</p>
<p>Between them they took home $75,879 in matching funds - slightly more than half of what was available for the whole round. An additional $69,184 was garnered from the opt-in round from Shell for a grand total of  $166,523 including the $21,460 they raised for themselves.</p>
<p>For that initial raise these projects garnered an average of 6.48 ‚ÄòExcess‚Äô votes between them (the difference between ‚Äòvotes‚Äô and ‚Äòvoters‚Äô) while the average for the whole round was 5.</p>
<p>For the $hell donations there was an additional column that did not cover those who opted not to go for the extra matching labelled ‚ÄòDirect Donations‚Äô which would be interesting to explore if that ever comes available, might be some good insight there.</p>
<p>Also took some snapshots of how the average amount donated to each project changed over time courtesy of data from <a href="https://gitcoin-grants-51f2c0c12a8e.herokuapp.com/#grants-leaderboard" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Streamlit</a> that showed some big changes towards the end of the round.</p>
<p>For most of the round one completely new project (although they are most likely running others too) was maintaining an unbelievable average of between 9 and 7 USD per donation. In the final hours the Grownations really came in thick and fast for one project, leaving them with a final avg of nearly $10 ; incl 20 ‚ÄòExcess Votes‚Äô and the high score of $750 difference between funds raised and ‚ÄòDirect Donations‚Äô.</p>
<p>Should have really made a gif of how this changes over time, could have been fun to look at but don‚Äôt think that this should be seen as a game.</p>

<p>Overall it seems like the final results squelched some of the most damaging social centrality seen amongst grantees and their focus on obtaining matching funds at the expense of others that was obvious in previous rounds. Seems like QF is working as intended this round.</p>

    As social centrality comes into focus, cluster-match QF is going to break some online friendships for the greater good (jk‚Ä¶:sweat_smile:). 
Kudos and gratitude to the entire team and the supporting community crew for this analysis and protecting the funds for public goods!

<p>Data below; you can copy+paste into whatever you are using to organise the results by w/e you want. Excess votes; was not sure what to call it but it‚Äôs simply difference between voters and votes. Difference C/E is the difference between USD Raised and Direct Donations. Capture one was taken on the 16th from the Grants Leaderboard showing the USD amount raised divided by the number of votes, last capture was taken just before the round ended. TFRTD not been verified, all are taken from projects round applications.</p>

            <p>Firstly, I would like to thank Gitcoin and the former climate advisory team from the bottom of my heart for their efforts to grow the Climate Solutions Program. As a grantee myself, I can testify to the fact that Gitcoin Grants for Climate Solutions have been instrumental for projects like ours, enabling us to build with momentum.</p>
<p>Gitcoin Grants offer a mechanism that can support climate projects in today‚Äôs market, a place where most traditional funding mechanisms fall short. The match amount distributed during this bear market stands as a testament to the team‚Äôs and Gitcoin‚Äôs commitment to fund what truly matters.</p>
<p>As we aim to elevate the Climate Solutions Program, I hope to see the Gitcoin Passport become more accessible to those on the frontlines of climate change. The current scoring mechanism makes adoption challenging in these regions. I also hope we introduce more appropriate metrics to measure the impact and performance of each project. As someone who has received not only funding but also the support of a community, I am keen to dedicate my energy to advancing the network‚Äôs mission.</p>
<p>I believe the next chapter will add further nuance and credibility to the Climate Solutions Program. Having interacted with the team leading the CCN, I am confident the community will accelerate climate action even more. We‚Äôll witness not only consistent growth in matching and crowdfunded amounts but also, importantly, see an increasing number of credible climate projects from around the world benefitting from Gitcoin Grants.</p>

<p>I‚Äôd love to be enrolled as part of the advisory council. I‚Äôve coordinated the Regen Network matching donations participation for 3 years in partnership with the Climate Round, as well as I have approved project submissions in past rounds.</p>
<p>I would also love to see someone from Blockchain for Climate represented on the Advisory Council, so it can serve all the member organizations of that network effectively as well.</p>

            <p>Sounds like a great new direction and I hope that together we find ways to involve non-Web3 people to the space. Passport made it so difficult to donate, that we decided to not bother participating in GR18.</p>
<p>I would make myself available to help shaping the CCN that we can also reach regular people, which have a significant impact on climate soluations, but won‚Äôt be going through all the hoops we built in our space.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we continue onboarding people to the <a href="https://twitter.com/7EnergyDAO" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">7Energy - Citizen Energy Community</a> using <a href="https://twitter.com/monerium" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Monerium</a> EURe token and a Safe contract based system for the automated financial transactions between members. It would be great to get donations for the extensive work that has to be done for this real world use case and I very much hope that CCN can be of help there as well.</p>

<p>Introducing the Climate Coordination Network (CCN). The new decentralized Climate Solutions Program will be managed by the Climate Coordination Network ‚Äî a global group composed of the former Gitcoin Climate Advisory team who have dedicated many hours to support the Climate Solutions Round over the past 18+ months. Since GR12, the Climate Solutions Round has enormously impacted the web3 Climate space. We have crowdfunded nearly $1M and distributed nearly $3.6M in funding to hundreds of projects.</p>

<p>Driven by the belief that climate action is the ultimate public good because climate change increasingly affects all of humanity, as well as a mission to accelerate climate action, the Climate Coordination Network is excited for the opportunity to take the Climate Solutions Program to the next level of effective and focused global impact. As an independently managed Community Round, the Climate Solutions Program will now be able to chart a more expansive course and explore new growth avenues, including becoming a legal entity, onboarding and networking new grantees from all over the world, and unlocking new funding mechanisms.</p>
<p>To our committed climate community around the globe: This transition will unlock new opportunities for collaboration to foster meaningful and sustainable climate action worldwide. You can look forward to closer communication and more ways to participate in the Climate Solutions Round operations in order to help navigate and shape our shared future.</p>
<p>To begin with, we are launching a new profile on Twitter (X): <a href="https://twitter.com/climate_program" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">@climate_program</a> and will be hosting spaces soon to gather community input and ideas for the future of the Climate Solutions Round. Be sure to follow us so that you can stay updated on the latest developments including revised eligibility criteria and opportunities for involvement.</p>
<p>Our first request for community support is in forming an advisory team that can help guide us as we formalize our team and structure. We are looking for advisors representing different blockchain enabled climate solutions use cases and geographic areas to help advance the mission of the Network. Drop a note in the comments or reach out directly if you want to get involved.</p>
<p>Finally, we‚Äôd like to thank Gitcoin for its commitment to addressing global challenges such as climate change and for providing the technology ‚Äî e.g, Quadratic Funding, Allo, Grants Stack, Passport ‚Äî that will enable a successful transition to decentralized grant funding for climate solutions. We appreciate the support of Gitcoin and all its contributors and, in the words of Taiwan‚Äôs Digital Minister Audrey Tang (and the beloved Star Trek series), our wish is that we all continue to work together to ‚Äúlive long and prosper.‚Äù</p>
<p>Public Goods are Good.<br>
