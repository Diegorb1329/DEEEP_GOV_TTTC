Asking questions is a great way to get supports or helps as a Gitcoin user. But it is important to know how to ask good questions so support team can effectively help you.

In this post, I would walk through how to ask good questions on Gitcoin (discord and knowledge base).

## Do your research before asking
There is a great post from freeCodeCamp named [Read - Search - Ask](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-get-help-when-you-are-stuck-coding/19514). So before asking, make sure to do some research by yourself, there are lots of informations and tools you could choose. 

Here I would like to introduce some tips:

- Mee6 bot for FAQ
- Support knowledge base
- Search feature on discord
- Google it

If you have any questions related with Gitcoin product, you should join our [Gitcoin Discord Server](https://discord.gg/gitcoin). 
Choose a `support` role in #start-here channel. And then join #general-support channel. In support channel, we have deployed Mee6 bot for the FAQ list. 

Please issue the command `!faq` to get the faq list.

### Use Mee6 bot for FAQ
Once you issued the command `!faq` in #general-support channel, you can see following text:

```
`!faq` â€” Get the following commands list. 

Use the following commands to learn more about a specific topic: 

`!kb` â€” See our whole knowledge base 
`!missing` â€” Add your missing contributions 
`!grant-status` â€” Check your new Grant status 
`!grant-inactive` â€” Learn about why your Grant is inactive 
`!grant-appeal` â€” Appeal your denied Grant 

Don't see what you're looking for? Check out the whole knowledge base at https://support.gitcoin.co or create a ticket
```

For now we covered several FAQ questions, you can issue the different commands to get the help.

### Use support knowledge base
Don't see what you're looking for? Check out the whole knowledge base at https://support.gitcoin.co 

There are rich knowledge on the support kb. please visit and search the keyword.

click `Search` on the top right and input the keywords as example:
![search-on-support-kb|664x500, 50%](upload://3oVcgFSGbDJM6j3JD4BlwqESHNW.png)

### Use search feature on discord
If still didn't solve your question, you can search the keywords on discord, here is an example.

click `Search` field on the top right and input the keywords as example:
(keyword `in:` means only search in specified channel)

![search-on-discord|620x500, 50%](upload://cEnLDXtQjN4hfWXTNpOZ8AfSfMy.png)

### Use Google
If still didn't solve your question, you can search the keywords, try the great google tool as following:
![search-on-google|522x500, 50%](upload://woID4UowJBMxZxq2JBjCyL09Igc.png)

So if you can solve your question by yourself, 
Congratulations! you learned!

If still have questions, please continue to read.

## Ask specific questions and provide details of the problem
If you cannot solve your questions, you can raise questions on [Gitcoin Discord Server](https://discord.gg/gitcoin). 

If there is no privacy in the question, just ask it in #general-support (public) channel, but if there is privacy info in your question, you can create a ticket in #create-a-ticket channel.

### Ask questions in public channel
Here is an example question like: 

`When is GR14?`

### Ask questions in ticket (private) channel
If you created a ticket, please provide detailed information for your question like:

-   The question description
-   Gitcoin user profile (like https://gitcoin.co/username)
-   the grants link (like https://gitcoin.co/grants/id/grant-name)
-   your wallet address 
-   the transaction link (etherscan or zkscan or polyscan)
-   Screenshot (better to have)

# Conclusion
Remember `Research before asking` , thanks a lot for your coordinations!
