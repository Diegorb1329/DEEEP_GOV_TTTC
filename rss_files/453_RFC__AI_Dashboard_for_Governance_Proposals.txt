https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/rfc-ai-dashboard-for-governance-proposals/16561
    ## The problem of governance

We are a team of Web3 builders, working on ways to help DAOs make better decisions, *faster*.

One pattern we have found in different DAOs is that they are impacted by *excessive* *governance burden*, which comes from the need to:

* Moderate online forums (like discourse)
* Consume proposals easily (getting to the point)
* Differentiating proposals (the good from the bad)

## A Visual solution for governance burden

We are exploring ways of representing proposal information visually, so it can be consumed quickly & easily. We use a combination of AI customized specifically for DAOs, and other software libraries.

#### Visual Summaries

For example, the general sentiment of comments on a proposal can be presented visually, so that a quick glance (rather than a 10 minute read) will give the reader an idea of the receptivity of the proposal.

![image|688x213](upload://9o5bmwHBtDS2C23unmU7EQsvKIu.png)


*In this example, users strongly favor the proposal.*

#### Mind Maps

Another way that proposals can be distilled is through mind-maps, to help users quickly gauge the benefit of a proposal. The mind map below has been generated from: [[GCP-009] - Upgrading Gitcoin‚Äôs Governance Contracts](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gcp-009-upgrading-gitcoin-s-governance-contracts/14010)

![image|690x368](upload://lL1alypZfXNZOhajQRO1XSOVpbu.png)


#### Tables

Tables can also create a way for quick proposal consumption. The table below has been generated from: [[GCP-009] - Upgrading Gitcoin‚Äôs Governance Contracts](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gcp-009-upgrading-gitcoin-s-governance-contracts/14010)

![image|690x365](upload://cqYUKXmmx0xgIRaQX2LcVPvGqsj.png)


## Our offer

We are looking for DAOs to participate in our alpha version of our dashboard. By offering our service free to the first DAOs that sign up, we hope to:

1. Use live proposal data to generate dashboards for the participating DAO
2. Get feedback and iterate to give the DAO better proposal management tools

#### To Participate

To accomplish this, we need participating DAOs to provide a read-only API key of their discourse platform. This will allow us to pull proposal data and package it in a way that is easy to consume for DAO users.

In summary, we are offering:

1. A way to reduce the governance burden through AI digests of proposals
2. To participate, Gitcoin needs to provide a read-only key of the discourse platform
3. Being read-only, this is risk-free and allows us to provide a dashboard for easy AI digests
4. Feedback from the community will allow us to improve the AI digests
5. This service is offered free to Gitcoin DAO, as it helps us improve our product.

            <blockquote>
<p>Can you share more on what this combination looks like?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pretty straightforward, actually. Most of the lifting is done using <a href="https://js.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">langchain</a>. To simplify a proposal, several LLMs are chained together. E.g. one‚Äôs job is is to fetch context online around a proposal, another one is to decide what context is needed to fetch, another one summarizes, another highlights, etc.</p>
<p>The prompts are specifically designed to work with proposals, so it‚Äôs not something throwaway like: ‚Äúsummarize this‚Äù. Each type of analysis (e.g. pros &amp; cons of a proposal) will go through maybe 5 LLMs. After that, simple javascript libraries to convert generated markdown to html, or to a mindmap. Happy to share more details.</p>

<p>Actually really cool ideas. Right now, it‚Äôs super alpha and rough so we want to get ideas from the DAOs and polish it up so it‚Äôs good. (In weekly short sprints). Since we have the structure set up, should be super easy to polish up. It still makes occasionall mistakes for now.</p>

We propose that Gitcoin diversify 10% of its stablecoin treasury holdings into Glo Dollar - the stablecoin that helps end extreme poverty. Doing so has three benefits: 

Reduce Gitcoin‚Äôs reliance on USDC - the current highly concentrated stablecoin allocation now has a single point of failure.
Enable Gitcoin‚Äôs treasury to have additional impact through Glo Dollar‚Äôs basic income funding mechanism that reduces extreme poverty.
Support the development of an alternative US regulated stableco‚Ä¶

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/skyfoxx">@skyfoxx</a> this looks great. Do you have any case studies of other DAOs using this kind of visualization and seeing tangible upticks either in participation or comprehension?</p>
<p>Also, would you be willing to do another example from another recent post, just to get a sense of some more visualizations? Maybe something that is not as comprehensive as GCP009 (since most posts are not very comprehensive and might not be as data rich).</p>
<p>I love the idea of visualizing more info in the gov forum (which is currently very text heavy).</p>

            <p>This looks great!</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle">@kyle</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/deltajuliet">@deltajuliet</a> are probably the people who could sign off on an experiment like this, not entirely in the loop on steward governance plans</p>

            <h2><a name="the-problem-of-governance-1" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#the-problem-of-governance-1"></a>The problem of governance</h2>
<p>We are a team of Web3 builders, working on ways to help DAOs make better decisions, <em>faster</em>.</p>
<p>One pattern we have found in different DAOs is that they are impacted by <em>excessive</em> <em>governance burden</em>, which comes from the need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moderate online forums (like discourse)</li>
<li>Consume proposals easily (getting to the point)</li>
<li>Differentiating proposals (the good from the bad)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="a-visual-solution-for-governance-burden-2" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#a-visual-solution-for-governance-burden-2"></a>A Visual solution for governance burden</h2>
<p>We are exploring ways of representing proposal information visually, so it can be consumed quickly &amp; easily. We use a combination of AI customized specifically for DAOs, and other software libraries.</p>
<h4><a name="visual-summaries-3" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#visual-summaries-3"></a>Visual Summaries</h4>
<p>For example, the general sentiment of comments on a proposal can be presented visually, so that a quick glance (rather than a 10 minute read) will give the reader an idea of the receptivity of the proposal.</p>
<p><img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/4/41cc8103200745570528797ed0c6f77b3b96a346.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="9o5bmwHBtDS2C23unmU7EQsvKIu" width="688" height="213"></p>
<p><em>In this example, users strongly favor the proposal.</em></p>
<h4><a name="mind-maps-4" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#mind-maps-4"></a>Mind Maps</h4>
<p>Another way that proposals can be distilled is through mind-maps, to help users quickly gauge the benefit of a proposal.

<h2><a name="our-offer-6" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#our-offer-6"></a>Our offer</h2>
<p>We are looking for DAOs to participate in our alpha version of our dashboard. By offering our service free to the first DAOs that sign up, we hope to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use live proposal data to generate dashboards for the participating DAO</li>
<li>Get feedback and iterate to give the DAO better proposal management tools</li>
</ol>
<h4><a name="to-participate-7" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#to-participate-7"></a>To Participate</h4>
<p>To accomplish this, we need participating DAOs to provide a read-only API key of their discourse platform. This will allow us to pull proposal data and package it in a way that is easy to consume for DAO users.</p>
<p>In summary, we are offering:</p>
<ol>
<li>A way to reduce the governance burden through AI digests of proposals</li>
<li>To participate, Gitcoin needs to provide a read-only key of the discourse platform</li>
<li>Being read-only, this is risk-free and allows us to provide a dashboard for easy AI digests</li>
<li>Feedback from the community will allow us to improve the AI digests</li>
<li>This service is offered free to Gitcoin DAO, as it helps us improve our product.</li>
</ol>
