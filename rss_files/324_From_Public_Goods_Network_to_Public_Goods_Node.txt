    I think PGN is a very cool project, and it's such a pity that it's going to be shut down.

However, providing sustainable funding for public goods remains a valuable issue that we need to continue exploring. I am currently initiating the Public Goods Node project at LXDAO, which is designed to continuously raise funds for public goods. Compared to PGN, it has two improvements. On the one hand, we don't need to create a new ecosystem but actively participate in the existing one, providing more developers to the ecosystem. On the other hand, by participating in the existing ecosystem, we can access more existing funds and then allocate these funds to public goods.

Additionally, PGNode will focus on the L1 ecosystem, providing on-chain transparency for the L1 ecosystem, allowing users to understand the condition of the ecosystem they are participating in.

If you are interested, we can discuss this together.

            <p>This is the project right? <a href="https://forum.lxdao.io/t/proposal-establish-pgnode-group/1918" class="inline-onebox">Proposal: Establish PGNode Group - Proposals - LXDAO</a></p>
<p>You should talk to Octant. They are doing something similar and I think your product roadmaps might intersect!</p>
