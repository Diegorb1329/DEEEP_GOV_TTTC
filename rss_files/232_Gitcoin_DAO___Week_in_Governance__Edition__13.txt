https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-dao-week-in-governance-edition-13/8711
    This weekly post has the ambition to summarize what‚Äôs been going on in the Gitcoin DAO Governance. Topics, ideas, proposals, and votes will be listed with links for further reading and discussion. If there‚Äôs anything missing please reach out! üìù

### [ü§ñ Meta-Governance](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/governance-meta/6)

* @owocki authored a thread on [Gitcoin Grants Side Rounds](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-side-rounds/8660). Side rounds are ‚Äútypically for ecosystems that are Ethereum-adjacent, and they are run during the same time as the main Ethereum round every quarter.‚Äù.

* @Sujiyan from Mask Network [proposed](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-from-mask-network-conduct-token-swap-with-maskdao/8655) a ‚Äútoken swap between $MASK and $GTC to further diversify both treasuries and strengthen the interaction between our communities.‚Äù The post on strategic token swaps on the MaskDAO forum can be found [here](https://we.mask.io/t/approve-maskdao-to-pursue-strategic-swaps-with-holdings/515).

* @AcceleratedCapital [added more information](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-treasury-vision/8254/3) to their thread on [Gitcoin Treasury Vision](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-treasury-vision/8254/); ‚ÄúWe are currently in the process of creating financial reporting and doing some legal work with Gitcoin Holdings on how best to implement these decisions‚Äù

* @owocki shared an ‚Äúoverview post about Gitcoin, so that prospective DAO participants know the why/what/how of GitcoinDAO‚Äù in a thread titled [TLDR - What is Gitcoin? [Updated Sept 2021]](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/tldr-what-is-gitcoin-updated-sept-2021/8694).

* @alisha [replied](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/what-are-the-kpis-that-gitcoindao-optimizes-for/8497/10) to the discussion around [What are the KPIs that GitcoinDAO Optimizes for](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/what-are-the-kpis-that-gitcoindao-optimizes-for/8497) with thought on ways to measure ecosystem impact with three main areas of importance; Impact of Discoverability, Community and Matching.

* @krrisis did a quick revision of the [GitcoinDAO homepage](http://gitcoindao.com) to make it easier for new contributors to find their way around. He also created [a new typeform](https://form.typeform.com/to/DiMdHaWe) which will help us evaluate new contributors more easily.

* The proposal to [Issue a 40k Grant to CLR.Fund](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-issue-clr-fund-a-40k-gtc-grant/8240) will soon be [live on Tally](https://www.withtally.com/governance/gitcoin/proposal/6) to get ratified onchain.

* The public library has started to become a key place to jam on public goods related topics, the group is discussing starting a shared Mirror publication.
* RFP initial winners and honorary mentions are set to be announced in the next week.

[Public Goods Prototyping (Moonshot Collective)](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-public-goods-prototyping/130)

* Every Friday the Moonshot Collective gets together to show off their progress. Individual projects demo what they‚Äôve been working on, and this week we had five projects demo.
* Key demos include Open Signal, Tip Party, Tokenstream, Scaffold Directory, and the Figma Community Design Kit.
* Demo videos for each project can be found on [ the YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVupIN3GgLtgYXXo87yq8plbR_Xm4wo5G).

[Decentralization Workstream](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-decentralize-gitcoin/180)

* A new team member from the community has joined our team! This new member was found through a Gitcoin hackathon and built a prototype of the Curation Game.

üíô [Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD-WG)
](https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/Fraud-Detection-Defense-f1a2969a9f324f57a02ef69a60b25cae)

* @DisruptionJoe authored a thread on [Threats to the Success of GitcoinDAO](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/threats-to-the-success-of-gitcoindao/8641) on the series of open workshop sessions FDD will be conducting to ‚Äúidentify threats & weaknesses of the GitcoinDAO during the first couple weeks of October.‚Äù.
If you want to attend please add your availability to [this group calendar](https://lettucemeet.com/l/b387p).
* GR11 ended last week and @DisruptionJoe authored a thread on [Expected Timeline for Completion, Ratification, and Payout of GR11 Matching Funds](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/expected-timeline-for-completion-ratification-and-payout-of-gr11-matching-funds/8673) with information on ‚Äúwhat needs to be done and when grant creators can expect payouts.‚Äù
* @erich [added](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/fdd-grant-approval-policy-for-daos/8537/6) to the conversation on [FDD Grant Approval Policy for DAOs](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/fdd-grant-approval-policy-for-daos/8537) with a [link](https://pol.is/34rdajkfxk) to a ‚ÄúPol.is conversation on this issue that we can leverage to find rough consensus with the community.‚Äù

* The [Steward Report Cards](https://stewards.eth.limo) are live! The Steward Report Cards provides the most valuable metrics on engagement for each Steward in the Gitcoin DAO. The cards aggregate public data from Discourse, governance participation and workstream involvement and calculate an overall Health-score. The project will be explained in more detail in an upcoming forum post by the workstrea.

* The second iteration of [Memepalooza](https://www.addevent.com/event/kb9034231) will take place in Discord on Friday. Memepalooza is not a contest - it's a collaborative jam session and a celebration of meme lords and great memes on the topic of public goods, web3 and the values of Gitcoin DAO, and it‚Äôs super fun!

That‚Äôs it for this week in Gitcoin DAO governance. Feel free to join the discussions via the links above and on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/gitcoin), and visit the [Gitcoin DAO Event calendar](https://www.addevent.com/calendars/pz351122/) to keep yourself updated on what‚Äôs to come!
