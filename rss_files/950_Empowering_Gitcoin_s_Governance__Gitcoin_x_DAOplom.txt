Empowering Gitcoin's Governance: Gitcoin x DAOplomats
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/empowering-gitcoins-governance-gitcoin-x-daoplomats/18615
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

Gitcoin has entered into a collaboration with [DAOplomats](https://www.daoplomats.org/), a community of experts passionate about fostering strong DAO governance. DAOplomats will be partnering with us to enhance several key aspects of Gitcoin's governance framework for a multi-month trial period.

<h2>How DAOplomats Will Support Gitcoin</h2>

Through this partnership, DAOplomats will be instrumental in:

* **Supporting DAO-Led Proposals:** DAOplomats will lend their expertise to streamline the process for DAO-initiated proposals, ensuring clear communication and efficient execution.
* **Empowering Stewards:** DAOplomats will work with our Steward program to ensure new and existing Stewards have the resources and support they need to effectively fulfill their roles.
* **Driving Robust Conversations:** DAOplomats will help us cultivate a vibrant and inclusive forum where Gitcoin community members can engage in constructive discussions and decision-making.

The compensation for DAOplomats' services will come from the previously approved [Ecosystem Collective budget](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/ecosystem-collective-s21-22-budget-proposal/18240).

<h2>Gitcoin's Commitment to Robust, Decentralized Governance</h2>

This collaboration underscores our commitment to building a robust, transparent, and democratic governance system for Gitcoin. We believe DAOplomats' expertise will be invaluable in strengthening our community's voice and shaping the future of Gitcoin.
