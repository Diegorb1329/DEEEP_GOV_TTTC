https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/update-reference-of-gg23-desci-community-round-applicatioin/20113
    We sincerely appreciate Gitcoin, our sponsors, grantees, donors, communities, and all Web3 contributors for their continuous support, funding, participation, and dedication to the growth of DeSci. 

Since 2022, this marks our fifth time organizing a DeSci community round, reflecting our commitment to advancing decentralized science. With over 400 members in our Telegram group and 129 DeSci projects in the KarmaGAP community, we have built a strong and engaged ecosystem. Thanks to our teamâ€™s experience and newly secured funding of ~$5,600, we are ready to make the GG23 DeSci round impactful and aligned with Gitcoinâ€™s mission.

Thanks Judges detailed feedback and score to us. Below are updates regarding our community, alignment with Gitcoin, team experience, and funding status:  

### **1. Community Size & Engagement**

- **129 DeSci projects** are actively involved in our [KarmaGAP DeSci community](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/community/desci-on-gitcoin).

  - **Donors:** 3,267  
  - **Small Donations:** 107.3K  
  - **Projects Supported:** 225  
  - **Matching Funds Distributed:** $706K

**Multi-language support**

In Gitcoin Grant 20 and 21, the DeSci round was the first and only community round to accept grantee applied in three different languages: **English**, **Chinese**, and **Spanish**. This multilingual approach has helped broaden accessibility and inclusion within the DeSci ecosystem, allowing more projects from diverse backgrounds to participate. We are committed to continuing this initiative for GG23, ensuring that language is not a barrier to innovation and collaboration in decentralized science.
