RFP: GG22 Grantee Onboarding/Education Program
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/rfp-gg22-grantee-onboarding-education-program/19364
    ## Overview

Our goal is to create a community-led onboarding program for grantees that will be delivered the week before GG22 goes live. We are seeking experienced grantees within the Gitcoin ecosystem to lead this onboarding program; they will be our Onboarding Partners.

## Scope of Work

Throughout this program it is important for Onboarding Partners to educate grantees and builders on:

* How QF works
* How to apply for GG22 (application process, understanding qualifications, connecting with GitHub)
* Assisting with and reviewing applications
* Understanding Checker
* Markdown
* How to use Grants Stack / Live Demo
* How to market rounds
* How to report any bugs throughout the application process

We expect onboarding partners to host their own onboarding sessions on Gitcoin‚Äôs Discord. Gitcoin will support the marketing and amplification of these onboarding sessions to assist with directing grantees to your sessions.

Additionally, we expect experienced grantees to submit an after-action report and answer a quick survey from the Gitcoin Team at the end of the Onboarding/Education Program to help the team understand the effectiveness of this program.

## Deliverables List

Google Slide Deck

Live demos

Video tutorials

Office Hours

It is up to those proposing to outline what the program will look like, and clearly include the ‚ÄúScope of Work‚Äù and the ‚ÄúDeliverables List‚Äù.

## Selection Criteria

We will be selecting 1 proposal within our ecosystem that includes one or a group of grantees that have participated in a minimum of 3 grants rounds. You will need to have experience with Gitcoin‚Äôs product suite. Have a time commitment of at least one week where you can spend 1-2 hours daily to successfully onboard and educate GG22 grantees and builders. We will amplify efforts and direct grantees to this program.

The sessions should include live demos, slideshows and space for AMA. The onboarding program should remain in the scope of work set out above.

## Timeline

Submissions are open until October 1 at 23:59 UTC

By October 4, experienced grantees will be selected and added to a Telegram chat or designated Discord channel for communication.

Between October 14 - 23, onboarding partners are expected to onboard, educate, and assist with any questions or concerns that grantees may have.

## RFP Managers

@MathildaDV (Grants Program Lead)
@DaeYunique (Grants Coordinator)

## Budget

$5000 to be paid in GTC

## Funding & Commitment
This will be funded through the Citizen Grants Program budget.

## Evaluation & Announcement

At the close of the submission, the RFP Managers will select experienced grantees according to the criteria. If there are any adjustments in the criteria, the adjustments will be published.

## Commencement of Work

The selected grantees will commence work between October 14 - 23.

For preparation,Onboarding Partners should create an onboarding plan for onboarding and educating grantees. The selected experienced grantees will also be added to a Telegram chat or dedicated Discord channel for communication.

Compensation will be dispersed upon the completion of the Onboarding/Education Program.

## Evaluation and Lessons Learned

Upon conclusion of the Onboarding/Education Program, we will provide a retrospective with feedback from the grantees, an after action report, and responses from the RFP managers.

## How to Apply
Upload your proposal as a reply to this post. Please make sure to include all the relevant details of the onboarding program, including who will be on the team. Proof of 3 GG round participation required.

<p>Would that qualify?  It would be 4 total.</p>

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kmllc">@KMLLC</a> ! Great proposal, but I have a few questions. You have quite a number of onboarding partners listed here. How do you plan to split the 5k? Also, I notice that a few of your onboarding partners don‚Äôt have the minimum of 3 GG rounds as a requirement. In order to strengthen your proposal, I would recommend removing them!</p>
<p>LMK if you have any questions/concerns!</p>

            <p><em>Thank you for opening up my permissions. Resubmitting the RFP here with links:</em></p>
<p><strong>GG22 Onboarding Program Proposal</strong></p>
<p>I am Cori, co-founder of Regens Unite and grantee of previous Gitcoin rounds + Gitcoin Citizens rounds. I am also a graduate of the first Gitcoin Round Manager Training in Dec 2023.</p>
<p>Together with my co-founder Guil, we have personally hosted multiple IRL onboarding sessions teaching web3 newbies about Gitcoin, either as stand-alone meetups or as a session within larger Regens Unite events.</p>
<p>Our sessions have always started with a high-level introduction to QF, a introductory walkthrough of the Gitcoin platform, and discussion around the strategy for fundraising including campaigning and communications.</p>

            <p>If anyone is wanting to team up, the Omniacs crew wouldn‚Äôt mind being part of a group and tackling a portion of the tasks.  We could do:</p>
<p>Video Tutorials - We‚Äôve been making Gitcoin tutorials for a while and have several on our Youtube channel up now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjwdCaWBK20" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/qexGbe-CMIA?feature=shared" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/SD8yWFtm7Vg?feature=shared" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD8yWFtm7Vg&amp;list=PLPA5Op1Vzgxy33Gzf8u0kFTA1EAyYB3wh&amp;index=16" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">playlist here</a>.</p>
<p>Google Slide Decks - We‚Äôve made several for Gitcoin in the past and could do a few for ‚ÄúAssisting with and reviewing applications‚Äù, ‚ÄúUnderstanding Checker‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow to report any bugs throughout the application process‚Äù, and maybe some other stuff not listed like ‚ÄúFinding your favorite grant‚Äù or ‚ÄúDeciding on what to fund‚Äù.</p>
<p>There is quite a bit of stuff we‚Äôd like to do, but don‚Äôt want the full responsibility of doing <em>everything</em>. So, with that said, if anyone is looking to squad up for this, respond back here and we‚Äôll link up!</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs say I have a project, where I could build an event with it, including 5 different thematic as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Art (design, animation, (more‚Ä¶))</li>
<li>Code (blockchain integration, imagery generator, (more‚Ä¶))</li>
<li>Sustainability (coordination, regenerative solutions, (more‚Ä¶))</li>
<li>Optimization (speed, cost, energy input-output optimization, (more‚Ä¶))</li>
<li>Education (video, onboarding sessions, group participation, (more‚Ä¶))</li>
</ol>
<p>So, the part that is not clear to me is, should I prior filling up this application, I should already have the necessary funds available ~5000$ in the form of GTC token (current price valuation for example), and offer a fraction of this amount distributed in the different thematic as above, or, we do create a proposal, and if this proposition is accepted, then we will move to round 2. as to you ‚ÄúGitcoin‚Äù, will fund this initiative with the 5K$?</p>
<p>If you could guide me or give me more details around my question, I would appreciate it!</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply! Have a wonderful day!<br>

            <p>Super! I love the decentralization effect by Gitcoin and enabling other grantees to educate and onboard even more grantees building OSS. Looking forward to it!</p>
