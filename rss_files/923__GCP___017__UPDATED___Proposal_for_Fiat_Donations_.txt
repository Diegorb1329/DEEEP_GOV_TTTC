    During GG21, the viaPrize team added a way to donate with PayPal to the Open Civics round.

**Overall stats**:

$3,778.70 in crowdfunding

141 donors

337 total donations

$11.21 average donation

**PayPal stats** (after PayPal and viaPrize fees and not including transactions sent for test purposes):

$272.60 in crowdfunding

12 donors

13 donations

$62.30 average donations

**7.21% of donation volume came from PayPal**. Upon review, Umar Khan the head of data for Gitcoin said that the proof of personhood through PayPal is sufficiently strong for sybil resistance. More details [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/we-donated-to-gitcoin-projects-with-credit-card-review-of-paypal-fiat-payments-in-gg21/19287/4)

We believe **this number would be much higher if the option were added directly into Grants Stack** because this was a new, unfamiliar feature only found on a separate website.

If it were directly in Grants Stack, **perhaps** the number would be **10-30%** immediately (impossible to know until we try it.)

Almost all of the ongoing Allo volume is through Grants Stack at this point with roughly 2M in donations per year. A **10-30% increase would mean 200k-600k more Allo GMV within a year**.

Across the long-term, **adding fiat capabilities to Grants Stack means that Allo Protocol is accessible to billions more people, increasing the potential user base by 100x**.

Not only that, making the platform more accessible means **easier partnerships with major corporations and governments**. Grants stack would no longer be another crypto platform just for crypto users, it would be a blockchain-based platform that anyone can use.

Maybe in 5 years Allo GMV will be 10x thanks to this capability.

These numbers are conjecture. It is impossible to know until we try. That is why we propose a one-time set up fee + a usage-based deal.

We are likely converting viaPrize into a nonprofit and launching a second company specifically for making web3 platforms more accessible to non-crypto users. We are already lining up clients in our waitlist who are sending us deposits. Visit [normie.tech](https://normie.tech) to sign up for a consultation.

We would like to **negotiate a contract with Gitcoin** to build these features directly into Grants Stack.

The system works by generating a wallet for each fiat user and sending stablecoins from a crypto reserve through the users‚Äô wallet and into the smart contract.

We propose to charge a **one-time set-up fee** (essential so we have funds in the crypto reserve) and an ongoing **percentage fee on fiat donations with a revenue split with Gitcoin**. This would add valuable insight into how users would respond to a platform fee which is a potential **way Gitcoin could become self-sustaining long-term**.

**Does the community want this?**

Open Civics community has noted fiat capabilities as one of the most demanded capabilities for their rounds. Full retrospective [here]([retrospective](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-retrospective-opencivics-collaborative-research-round/19313))
![Screenshot 2024-09-29 at 6.28.09 AM|690x225](upload://mWnpCx3ZqT3tp5YC7oxlBPp1hC8.png)

During GG21, a majority of community round teams asked for us to set this up for them when they saw what we made with Open Civics. We didn't have the resources to set up a crypto reserve for all of them.

We already have 4 groups applying for community rounds asking us if we can do this with them for GG22 and also Monty of the Celo rounds.

![Screenshot 2024-09-29 at 6.33.14 AM|690x195](upload://jzYIse8vTRUkV5oNnlLsJKPfgWL.png)


**We believe meeting this community demand directly within Grants Stack in time for GG22 would be the best solution**. We expect the Gitcoin team is extremely busy, so we look forward to hearing if that is a feasible time frame or if we should plan for something further into the future. The demand on dev time for Gitcoin would be minimal as we just need to add a button and our system takes care of the rest. Upon review we also found that this feature would be unaffected by the transition to Allo 2.1 

To my knowledge, this is the biggest action Gitcoin could take with the potential to massively and quickly increase Allo GMV by opening up Grants Stack to 100x as many people. 

And of course, we invite community input on this thread. 

It is thanks to the [support of this community](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-appreciations-thread/18332?u=noahchonlee) that our team exists and we want to know what would genuinely be helpful for the ecosystem. Grateful to @umarkhaneth @owocki @MathildaDV @masterhw @omniharmonic @deltajuliet @rohit @Sov @thedevanshmehta for their encouragement in this process as we've gradually learned how Allo works over the past year.

If you have thoughts on what fiat donations would mean for Gitcoin, please leave a comment.

            <p>Yes, those prices are unrealistic, seems like the reporter didn‚Äôt make a good job at the math.</p>
<p>Those accounts go for way less, price depends on many variables, but you may be surprised how much of legacy payment system accounts are up for sale on the internet.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: It is cheaper to attack Stripe, PayPal, and others legacy payment systems than to attack the Model-based Detection built by Passport Team, because of centralized points of failure and similar risks associated with the Legacy Payment System.</p>
<p>If add additional friction to verify those payments then yes it could lower the risks, yet if the Red Team decides to attack the Rounds consistently then you may face two problems; the merchant reaching out to close the account or asking a higher fee because your transactions are labeled as ‚Äúhigh-risk‚Äù.</p>

            <p>Hi Wasabi, I took a look and this report says there‚Äôs hacked PayPal accounts available on the dark web for purchase for $161.59 each. That‚Äôs much too expensive per account for it to be a realistic sybil attack</p>

            <p>Yes, it is unfair, it makes it more easy for some than for others. In Brazil for digital payments we use something called Pix, not Paypal. So imagine if the Round had allowed Pix donations, but not Paypal ones, how would the non Brazilian grantees feel? If Pix was allowed, I would get my mother, family and friends to donate. But Pix is not used in other countries, so it would be unfair with Paypal donors, and would of course only favor Brazilians.</p>
<p>Imo the safe method, where everyone can participate in a democratic way is for grantees to invest in educating their supporters about autocustody and web3 tooling for public goods.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/luukdao">@LuukDAO</a> comments, I agree with him that donating with Paypal &gt; not donate at all. To solve this problem maybe round operators could add a box for the project‚Äôs Paypal/Pix/Stripe/etc addresses and people could donate in fiat directly to them if they prefer. However letting these donations get matched with community funds is very unsecure, inequal and maybe not aligned with Gitcoin intents.</p>

<ul>
<li>If Sybil Defense relies on PayPal alone, then it is weak and have many attack vectors.</li>
<li>If a Payment can be disputed <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/security/buyer-protection-resolution" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">180 days via Buyer Protection</a>, then whoever is receiving the PayPal Funds is liable for 6 months on the possibility of having a claim opened against you.</li>
<li>If a central entity/group (people who provide the list of ‚ÄúFiat Donors‚Äù to the Round Manager) have the decision-making over Model-based Detection, then you‚Äôre introducing another attack vector that relies on a workflow that already introduced few attack vectors (PayPal)</li>
<li>If a merchant is being used to ‚Äúreceive‚Äù the PayPal funding and convert this into $USDC and charge a fee during this process then this is considered a ‚Äúsale or purchase‚Äù and applies the same 180 days Buyer Protection; meaning that if Red Team decides to attack a round then you may not notice the issue until Chargebacks Claims start to pile up and your merchant start calling.</li>
<li>If a merchant is being used to process global payment for anything crypto related then i guess this will be a ‚Äúhigh-risk‚Äù merchant, if this merchant provides the assurances that they handle Chargebacks then yay you have 1 less problem in your plate but still if your Sybill strategy relies on PayPal then it is weak because PayPal as a TradFi System have many attack vectors on its own.</li>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I‚Äôm glad we can discuss the merit of certain features.</p>
<p>I believe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helping someone acquire/earn their first crypto to donate &gt; having someone donate with Paypal.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, I also believe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having someone donate with Paypal &gt; having someone not donate at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can understand where the concerns related to PayPal donations come from as: 1. It‚Äôs harder to validate their independence than onchain donations and, to a lesser extent, 2. Many underserved communities can‚Äôt access PayPal (as easily).</p>
<p>We should continue to monitor these effects, but I feel the largest wins can be made by continuing to make it easier and more rewarding to donate onchain and stick around!</p>

            <p>I would like to note this chart is taken out of its original context. It was a simple simulation to show what round results might have looked like if verified PayPal transactions didn‚Äôt receive quadratic funding, though it‚Äôs not a fully accurate counterfactual since presumably some portion of those donors would have still contributed via crypto instead. In other words, please do not rely on this chart for empirical data.</p>

            <p>Tests about what in specific? Because if you refer to my statement about PayPal and Fiat Payments Security, this is public information, and you can verify it with a simple google search.</p>
<p>Whoever receives PayPal and give $USDC in exchange is at risk of many legacy issues, I don‚Äôt need to run a test to know that because it is public domain already and plenty of research about it.</p>

            <p>The table I showed previously shows how Paypal use is skewed to a few northern countries what is very undemocratic, I hope that <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/thedevanshmehta">@thedevanshmehta</a> can join this forum, once he was the one who suggested adding paypal after the round was approved by the community.  I also hope that other round opperators also join this discussion,  like <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/montymerlin">@MontyMerlin</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/luukdao">@LuukDAO</a> from Regen Coordination and BioFi, and the operator of the Youth in Need Round.</p>
<p>Please be aware that my concern is with the integrity of the Gitcoin Community that voted for rounds aligned with their democratic and safety measures, It‚Äôs easy to judge that I am here trying to get some crumbs, but it is not the case. I am very found and thankful for the relationships I have built with all of you over these years.</p>
<p>We haven‚Äôt been presented the round results yet, but in the round‚Äôs Signal group <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/metahands">@metahands</a> ran simultations without the Paypal donations, which shows clearly that from the 4th to the 15th places there would be significant changes in the results:<br>

<p>If you can show us a decent collusion protection and democratic use of fiat donations, I would support Viaprize. But this opaque and inequal functioning only raises concerns about the reliability of the tool, and there‚Äôs a chance that the Gitcoin Community wouldn‚Äôt approve giving 20k for allegedly ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù rounds. I reinforce that this happened not because of operators will but simply because of demographics of Paypal users and lack of transparency of fiat tx.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/noahchonlee">@noahchonlee</a> My perception is that you basically made it so easy that you brought in every mother, aunt, brothers. sisters, cousins, entire families and friends‚Ä¶ but overwhelmingly from the North‚Ä¶ am I wrong?</p>
<p>as a personal opinion you would be a lot more democratic for the world if you could take regional QFs to Paypal for folks in these Paypal markets , and regular no Paypal rounds for the global community.</p>
<p>It would be nice if for compensation all  the Paypals operators joined a Global  South Round</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not wondering, I know it is easier to ‚Äú<strong>Make, Buy or Hack</strong>‚Äù PayPal verified accounts than to make wallets with enough on-chain history that doesn‚Äôt look like a Bot to pass the COCM &amp; Passport Model Based Defense.</p>
<p>This is why if your Sybil Defense is ‚ÄúPayPal said this is a verified user‚Äù then you have a problem as the introduction of PayPal and other FIAT Methods it is just introducing new attack vectors for; <strong>custodian of Fiat, Round Operator, Matching Pool, Grants Stack and Gitcoin</strong> as a whole, because those attacks will be ‚ÄúAllow listed‚Äù and its weight would count for matching.</p>

<p>Again, if your sybil resistance relies on the data that is coming from paypal then this may be flawed due to how easy is to do ‚Äúshady stuff‚Äù on PayPal.</p>
<p>If you decide to implement other forms of verification that the donation actually came the real customer then yes it becomes way more resistant, PayPal alone won‚Äôt cut it unless you introduce ‚Äúfriction‚Äù that makes the process safer.</p>

<p>I am not a round operator yet, but if i venture into trying to bring FIAT to my QF Round, i won‚Äôt rely solely on what PayPal said as by default PayPal transactions aren‚Äôt final and you could get a chargeback even 180 days down the line.</p>
<p>Easy way to improve the actual flow? Do extras verifications on each transaction no matter the amount; you could leverage a Blockchain-native KYC Provider and this could be a Trojan Horse to ‚ÄúOnboard‚Äù that person into Web3.</p>

            <p>Thank you for sharing the stats! &gt;40% in all those countries is actually a lot more than I was expecting.<br>
Definitely agree that work you do onboarding people to web3 who don‚Äôt have access to tradfi and bank accounts is AWESOME and exactly the sort of work that crypto ecosystem should be doing that provides value by letting everyone access these systems.<br>
I also think adding in fiat doesn‚Äôt affect any of that, it just adds an additional payment method that‚Äôs easier so that way more people participate in these blockchain systems, the ecosystem grows, there‚Äôs more alloGMV and easier partnerships for Gitcoin as they appeal to wider groups, etc.</p>

<li>The best way to onboard newbies imo is through purpose and usecase. If in your example your mother didn‚Äôt learn how to have autocustody and participate in the rounds it‚Äôs because there are not enough incentives for her to go through the trouble of learning. This is why every Gitcoin grantee is incentivized to concentrate their efforts in onboarding community. Gitcoin community is aligned with this democratic Purpose. We have to cultivate this commons soil, spread the news and more users will join. Fair funding allocation already creates a lot of network effects, believe me. We‚Äôve been onboarding unliterate rural brazilians because they believe in our purpose, and if we can learn than I‚Äôm sure anyone can. Remember, banks and large companies are not democratic, unbanked people <strong>can‚Äôt</strong> use them. Your mother however <strong>can</strong> use web3 platforms because they are indeed democratic, but maybe she just haven‚Äôt seen the Purpose yet.</li>

            <p>i think the biggest problem with PayPal isn‚Äôt related to the flow between ViaPrize, Grants Stack, Sybil Defense and the ‚Äúuser‚Äù, what Diogo explains is something that could be ‚Äúexploited‚Äù big time if the <strong>Red Team</strong> figures out a way to join the Round as a Grantee but also Attack the Round via PayPal &amp; Fiat donations unless some other security measures are implemented after the donation is made via FIAT.</p>
<p>If no verification is made on the payment because it came from a ‚Äúverified PayPal address‚Äù, then this is a choke point for Red Team to exploit due to how cheap it is to get Verified PayPal Accounts out there.</p>
<p>If you get this API to verify people legal names, this doesn‚Äôt mean this is not an attack unless you KYC every transaction beyond the ‚Äúverified‚Äù status coming from PayPal.</p>
<p>Bank Account transfers via Stripe won‚Äôt clear instantly and kinda defies the purpose; for the Cards via Stripe scenario, I would say this one is way more secure as long as 3D Security is enabled via SMS to verify cardholder actually is making the transaction, if Visa/Mastercard 3D security is done via Email or Pin Codes then it has a higher degree of a malicious transaction.</p>

            <p>Hey Diogo! Great feedback.</p>
<ol>
<li>Super intriguing point. I‚Äôm curious <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/umarkhaneth">@umarkhaneth</a> thoughts on this</li>
<li>Great point. Though PayPal is available in most all countries, by far most existing users are western countries. I‚Äôm wondering if we can get bank account transfers through Stripe and Visa card payments instead (we‚Äôre trying to get API access that lets us check people‚Äôs legal names for sybil defense.) Do you think that would have the same issue or be an improvement?</li>
<li>My thought process towards this is that web3 users can still choose to rely on more privacy preserving on-chain sybil defense while also allowing anyone to participate. I love the ideal of democratization in web3, but if we build platforms that my mom can‚Äôt use then what are we democratizing?<br>
Definitely agree that these points should be considered <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></li>

            <p>I was a grantee in the Land Regenerators Round, which experimented with disabling Gitcoin Passport and allowed the same match impact for crypto and Paypal‚Äôs donations above $5, and will share my perceptions about it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Crypto donations are transparent and can use social graphs to flag collusion, while Paypal donations can‚Äôt. I have been in rounds where a project was flagged because it distributed crypto funds to wallets that then donated back to the project. In Paypal Rounds this is not possible to flag.</li>
<li>Paypal is a northern company unknown in the global south so its use obviously benefits grantees from  Europe, USA, Australia and other Paypal markets. It makes obsolete the saying ‚ÄúI came for the money and stayed for the tech/community‚Äù, doesn‚Äôt incentivize learning about web3 tools, financial autonomy or public goods and brings in legacy finance intermediaries culture.</li>
<li>Not clear to me whats the point of using web3 infrastructure if the round doesn‚Äôt consider web3 reputation and security. Seems to me like if crowd wisdom was replaced by individual agency in convincing tech able donors. It could be done in a web2 way just using the QF formula, Paypal could fund a matching pool and do it within their network, the Paypal Rounds.</li>
</ol>
<p>I praise the experimental aspect of a Land Regenerators round,  so worth analyising the results to prevent unwanted outcomes in the future. We participated in joy and are very grateful for the dedication of operators, grantees and donors. Will use our funds carefully over the next six months. They represent ~0.8% of a matching pool of 200k distributed among 30 grantees.<br>
In our end, thanks to the support we had in past rounds we built a small treasure and will continue stewarding food forests irl and onboarding people to web3 public goods, and will start managing the funds in a multisig with local team newbies. Resilience in practice.</p>
<p>I understand and respect if this is the intention of <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/metahands">@metahands</a> the Land Regenerators Round, but truly hope that <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/jon-spark-eco">@jon-spark-eco</a>, Coreen, the CCN and Gitcoin consider these aspects in community before accepting fiat in future rounds.</p>
