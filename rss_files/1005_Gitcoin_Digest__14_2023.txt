# üî• Hot Topics:

* At EthCC, Supermodular announced the launch of a new integration with Lens Protocol that will bring Quadratic Funding (QF) to web3 social apps. The pilot launch was [QuadraticLenster.xyz](https://www.quadraticlenster.xyz/), a web3 social media app with funding mechanisms embedded in the newsfeed. Get up to speed on how the experiment went and watch the full talk about social media and public goods by @owocki in the [QuadraticLenster.xyz Launch Wrap-Up](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/quadraticlenster-xyz-launch-wrap-up/15962).

* @koday requests feedback on the [GG18 Round Eligibility Criteria](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-feedback-request-gg18-round-eligibility/15942), outlining the general policy that all grants must meet to be considered for acceptance into any of the four core rounds. Additionally, grants must meet additional criteria specific to the round they are applying for, which will be provided in the description of each round's eligibility criteria.

The updated version incorporates previous feedback, including a basic ROI analysis with an ongoing metrics website, outlining the strategic value of the OpenData Community to Gitcoin and highlighting the positive impact derived from supporting decentralization at the data layer.

# üß≠ Weekly Workstream Update

## Allo

* The development is currently in week nine, MVP end-to-end flow and Strategy library are completed, and the main components of the project are in place, with minor adjustments still needed.

* A library of nine strategies has been completed, making it easier for users to implement custom strategies with low auditing expenses.

* Protocol testing is a priority this week, aiming for close to 100 tests covering each and every component.

* Upcoming focus on documentation preparing for the audit next week, including guidelines for both auditors to understand the protocol and for developers to use the protocol effectively.

* The team had a successful and well-received presence at conferences like EthBarcelona, EthCC, and Schelling Point. Educational talks and workshops were delivered, generating around 50 leads for potential partnerships and integrations, exceeding the results from previous conferences.

## Grants Stack

* PGN mainnet was launched on Grant Stack, completing support for both testnet and mainnet. A collaboration with the Supermodular team on a Gitcoin-hosted bridge is in progress.

* The next priority is to release the multi-round checkout, with significant progress already made on the changes required for Allo V1 and the new contract, allowing users to checkout across different rounds and chains all in one cart.

* Spike on matching estimate calculations is done. Matching estimates at checkout are in progress.

* The drip campaign continues, with an upcoming article on identifying high potential grantees. Additionally, refining the channel strategy is underway, with a focus on supporting direct grants in the future.

* The [Manager Toolkit](https://manager-toolkit.super.site/) is being updated as a more robust guide and inspiration for running a Quadratic Funding grants program.

* Support Ticket Stats (July 17-23) increased: 216 new tickets via live chat and 70 new tickets via email, revolving around Passport score, twitter stamp, and fb stamp. Use support@gitcoin.co or [intercom](https://intercom.help/gitcoin/en/) for filing issues.

* Progress has been made in defining the service offerings, estimating the costs and resources needed for program rounds (Core + Featured). Collaboration with the MMM team and others is ongoing to refine the roles and responsibilities.

* Upcoming focus will be on further developing the functions of sales and partnerships to drive revenue. The next steps involve managing the expenses and overhead of the workstream to acceptable levels, creating and maintaining an ongoing P&L analysis.

* GG18 plan is near final, and planning for GG19 has begun, scheduled for November 1st to 15th. Mark your calendars now (and check out the [PGF Calendar](https://gitcoin.notion.site/94f8ea7ed6cd48acb1c4b78be55987b7?v=90cc8a7dcf234697af3896473e5d34f7) to stay up to date).

* The team is making progress in identifying featured rounds for GG18 and GG19. Standard reports and a simple CRM have been developed to track opportunities, and follow-ups from EthCC are underway to explore potential opportunities.

## Passport

* Passport Stamp updates include a twitter stamp revamp and six stamps have been integrated: Phi, Guild, Holonym, Idena, Civic, & Hypercert, all with new scores and scoring weights.

* Ongoing Release support. The launch of onchain passports is tentatively targeted for August 15.

* ComposeDB Upgrade and Humanode & CyberConnect Stamps are still in progress.

* Over 2k new followers were gained on Twitter over the last 2 weeks, with over half a million impressions; and high memetic resonance building up about Sybil Defense tools.

* Gitcoin Passport integration into Guild has been announced, Galxe NFT experiment will be announced this week. Passport Brand revisit is in final stages

* An Information Architecture update with automated docs and tools, simplified Passport introduction, and Nextra migration are under planning.

## MMM

* Website updates have been deployed on grants.gitcoin.co and WTFisQF.com.

* Gitcoin Grants asset development is in progress for the upcoming GG18 campaign, including internal Pitch Decks, persona review and documentation, channel audit/revisit, and brand book sprints

* Gitcoin has been working on repositioning itself as a tech-first organization focused on the funding, building, and protection of digital public goods and protocols. This effort seems to be paying off as [the media is starting to use this new narrative to describe Gitcoin](https://decrypt.co/news-explorer?pinned=242330&title=gitcoins-layer-2-ethereum-network-aims-to-finance-public-goods-reduce-transaction-costs), instead of just focusing on hackathons and bounty programs.

* The recent Gitcoin House hosted at EthCC was a huge success, gathering positive feedback and valuable insights from interviews with various stakeholders and over 200 attendees. Talks by @meglister, @kevin.olsen, and @azeem were well-received, with @0xZakk  ‚Äòs [talk about Allo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVG-2ZgY7w) being particularly recommended.
