    Create a blockchain Nobel Prize

Purpose: 
1. Reward those who contribute to the development of the   blockchain and promote the development of the blockchain
2. Increase the value of gtc and enhance the influence of gitcoin
3. If the Nobel Prize of blockchain can be made, I believe it will be a cool thing

principle:
	1. gtc holders nominate
	2. gtc holder votes and selects three winners
3 .Donors vote for the final winner
4.GTC holders finally vote for confirmation, if passed, the winner will be produced, if not passed, re-elected

            <p>Hello and thanks for sharing your idea with the DAO.  It would certainly be very cool to have blockchain nobel prize, but it might take some time until it becomes official imo <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=12" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>On the other hand it would be cool to create a mechanism similar to what you presented just for the fun of collective decision making</p>
