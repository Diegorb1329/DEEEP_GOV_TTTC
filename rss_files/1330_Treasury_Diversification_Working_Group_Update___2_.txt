    **Treasury Diversification Working Group Update - 2/14/2022**

Hi all, sharing an update from the working group. Apologies for the delay - from now on, we'll share these updates on *Saturdays*.

**Update from Last Week**
This week, our focus was on preparing to have conversations with strategic partners.

* Formed plan for how weâ€™ll reach out to and speak with candidate partners (how & where weâ€™ll speak with them, how/where/when weâ€™ll have them speak to the community, etc.). More details to come, but we plan on having initial calls with partners and the working group and a larger Q&A session with the community.
* Formed list of 40+ potential partners.
* Reached out to potential candidates and have them fill out our interest form.
* Updated our interest form to make it easier for partners to use.

**Plan for This Week**
* Ramp up our outbound requests potential candidates and have them fill out our interest form.
* Share any conflicts of interest (as defined in our Ethics Policy in [forum post 2 ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/treasury-diversification-part-ii-welcoming-strategic-partners/9825)).
* Draft thoughts on terms of the partnership (e.g. vesting schedule, etc.)
* Begin having initial calls with partners

**Asks from the Community**
If you'd like to recommend a candidate strategic partner, please leave a comment on the second forum post or contact a member of the working group. If you have other questions or feedback, please feel free to leave a comment on this thread!
