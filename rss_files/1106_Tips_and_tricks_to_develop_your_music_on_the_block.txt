Have you looked at Harrison First <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/harrison-first" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Harrison First price, FIRST chart, market cap, and info | CoinGecko</a>?<br>
He is offering he has his own coin that distributes to his community and I think is a very interested idea to play with.<br>
He currently he has a description like plan that if you have 1000 coins you can access all his content and with that coin you can get nfts and other discounts.<br>
Also you can provide liquidity and the other defi cool stuff.<br>
Ialso would like to explore the idea what should be the role of a DAO of artists.<br>
For example what the theme of the songs should be?<br>
Is that songs carry a message to the fans and to the words?<br>
How artists should behave on a DAO?</p>

            <p>I wonder why, music NFT is not good as visual design. I mean, we can see it through the price and bid.</p>

            <p>I see alot of people trying to use nft s with music. And it just doesn’t make sense. Because it can be copied in so many ways and maybe should be. I think a dao could collect royalties if deployed correctly in smart contracts.</p>

            <p>One guy started dao records , I first saw it on cryptovoxels, which is a awesome place if you never been I recommend………but yes I wanna make some max headroom mix tapes with analog video mixers and have a live music event in cryptovoxels or decentraland. I think realestate is expensive so might need to get pleaserdao to pull together some funds!</p>

            <p>Soopercolt45 On Audius, I also tried lum app and it has a more interactive coin system but not defi. Their system helps you get songs and stems in “the exchange” where you can collab and make $ off stems you’ve made and get followers way easier than soundcloud.</p>
