    Our GG22 OSS program round matching results are live [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WMFW6YrLIodpKoGcE79Vgf9vgBXXnC-JXw2w1Veds8s/edit?gid=1613004131#gid=1613004131)! We‚Äôll have five days for review and feedback then, barring any major issues, will proceed with payouts by November 22.

Special thanks to @umarkhaneth for your partnership in crafting this post.

## TLDR

* GG22 saw a number of exciting new product features, such as Quick Bridge and [Mint Attestations](https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/mint-attestations-capturing-your-impact).
* We implemented the same two-pronged [sybil resistance strategy](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/our-sybil-resistance-strategy-for-gg20/18524) as we‚Äôve been using since GG20. We used a [pluralistic variant of QF](https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/leveling-the-field-how-connection-oriented-cluster-matching-strengthens-quadratic-funding) and we used Passport‚Äôs model based detection system. We did not do any closed-source silencing of sybils/donors. Instead, we‚Äôre solely relying on our mechanism and Gitcoin Passport.
* Discussion will be open for five days before payouts are concluded next week. A [GG22 pre-ratification](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gg22-pre-ratification/19501) was passed through governance, speeding up the process of payouts to grantees.

## Round Overview

Every round sees new developments. Some of the most exciting in GG22 included:

* Returning to our Open Source Software Program after GG21 was a fully [community-led round.](https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/gg21-results-retrospective)
* 7 Community Rounds. Read the [GG22 announcement post](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg22-community-rounds-announced/19450) for those selected to run during this round.
* Providing the same sybil resistance tooling we use for our rounds to every community using Grants Stack by creating a [cluster-matching calculator ](http://github.com/gitcoinco/qf-calculator)and integrating with [Passport‚Äôs model based detection](https://support.passport.xyz/passport-knowledge-base/stamps/guide-to-model-based-detection).
* Expanding our product features to include Quick Bridge and Mint Attestations.
* Consolidating all of our program rounds onto Arbitrum.

## ![:abacus:|20x20](upload://mkuUumpgcCNkv6O1f7MLCaNML3J.png ":abacus:") Round and Results Calculation Details

Before GG20 began, we proposed a two-pronged [sybil resistance strategy](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/our-sybil-resistance-strategy-for-gg20/18524). To recap it briefly, we would continue to use COCM (Connection-Oriented Cluster Matching) as we had in GG20 & GG22.

As explained in the post, and the [paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4311507) which introduced this mechanism to the world, COCM is much less vulnerable to Sybil Attacks than ordinary QF because it reduces the matching of donors who look similar.

In addition, over the past few rounds, Passport‚Äôs Model-Based Detection system has yielded greater sybil resistance than the stamp-based system without any of the user friction. When used together, we believe these two tools produce the most sybil-resistant results we‚Äôve ever had.

There were some major updates made to Passport‚Äôs MBD system, which you can read more about [here](https://docs.passport.xyz/building-with-passport/model-based-detection/available-models).

### Connection-Oriented Cluster Matching (COCM)

COCM is an approach within Gitcoin Grants that enhances Quadratic Funding by prioritizing projects with diverse support bases, helping to counteract sybil attacks and coordinated groups trying to unfairly influence funding distribution. Key elements include:

* Diversity Bonus: COCM increases matching funds for projects supported by a wide array of "tribes" or distinct groups, rewarding cross-group support and broad appeal.
* Markov Chain Enhancement: Recent updates to COCM use a Markov chain approach to gauge connection strength between users and projects, providing stronger sybil resistance by analyzing indirect connections.
* Funding Distribution: COCM‚Äôs design inherently shifts some funds from top projects to those in the "long tail," enhancing the reach of smaller or niche projects.

### Gitcoin Passport‚Äôs Model-Based Detection System

The Gitcoin Passport team has implemented a model that evaluates on-chain activity to detect potential sybil accounts, enhancing funding fairness by:

* Address Probability Scoring: The model assigns each address a probability score, indicating whether it likely belongs to a genuine user or a sybil account.
* Continuous Improvement: While the model sometimes mistakenly flags new users with limited on-chain history, the team is refining the dataset and expanding to include Layer 2 networks, effectively reducing sybil influence on funding results.

These efforts together strengthen Gitcoin‚Äôs defenses against manipulation, helping to ensure fair distribution of funds to genuine community-supported projects.

## Code of Conduct Reminder

As a reminder to all projects, [quid pro quo ](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/about-gitcoin/policy/understanding-potential-attack-vectors/bribery-quid-pro-quo)is explicitly against [our agreement](https://grants-portal.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-grants-grantee-portal/gg19-eligibility). Providing an incentive or reward for individuals to donate to specific projects can affect your ability to participate in future rounds. If you see someone engaging in this type of behavior, please [let us know.](https://forms.gle/gjnz7mtCcd6aRTFw6)

*We have removed Pheasant Network from matching distribution calculations, as this project clearly participated in Quid Pro Quo.*

## Next Steps

We plan to distribute the matching by November 22, after the [results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WMFW6YrLIodpKoGcE79Vgf9vgBXXnC-JXw2w1Veds8s/edit?gid=1613004131#gid=1613004131) are open for discussion for five days.

It‚Äôs worth noting that GG22 [pre-approved the matching fund](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gg22-pre-ratification/19501) to be paid out before results were posted. This means that the payout process to grantees will occur faster, after this post has been left open for community input.

We are also hosting an internal retro in the following weeks and will publish further results and learnings. And as always, a detailed blog post will be published on the day that payouts are distributed.

We‚Äôre also always looking for direct feedback from the community on which improvements would make GG23 even better. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to let us know!

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/chain_l">@chain_l</a>! Thank you for your comment. There are a few reasons why matching is 0:</p>
<ul>
<li>minimum donation amount not reached</li>
<li>donors only donated to their project</li>
<li>not enough activity on their wallets</li>
</ul>

            <p>Hello <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/mathildadv">@MathildaDV</a>!<br>
Thank you for such an amazing recap of the GG22 round and its results. The level of transparency you bring to all of Gitcoin‚Äôs work is simply outstanding!  <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/clap.png?v=12" title=":clap:" class="emoji" alt=":clap:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/clap.png?v=12" title=":clap:" class="emoji" alt=":clap:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/clap.png?v=12" title=":clap:" class="emoji" alt=":clap:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>I think it would be incredibly insightful to see a comparative data analysis spanning rounds GG20 through GG22, especially focusing on donor behavior and trends in the OSS rounds. It would be fascinating to look at things like which types of projects attracted the most donations, how donation amounts have evolved across rounds, and any shifts in project categories that are gaining interest. Plus, examining whether donor participation has increased or decreased over time would give a clearer picture of community engagement.</p>
<p>This kind of analysis could give both the Gitcoin team and the community a richer understanding of the dynamics within OSS funding and how it‚Äôs growing or changing with each round. Just some ideas that could shed light on how we‚Äôre collectively making an impact over time!</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>

            <p>In a former life as a business strategist, I always found cycle over cycle comparisons useful. Typically when they can be visualized side by side and charted, it can lead to some learnings of opportunities. Might just be me, but I would find value in having this type of analytical view.</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing the results. Hopefully these matched funds will aid in the effort of making these projects sustainable through time. Gitcoin product team definitely listens to community feedback and executes timely to address challenges, as is evident with every subsequent iteration to streamline the user experience.</p>
<p>One query I would have as a Gitcoin Steward, is there a simplified compare and contrast with these results &amp; GG20 since both focused on OSS rounds?</p>
<p>If not no stress, just a nicety for an apples to apples comparison.</p>

<p>Before GG20 began, we proposed a two-pronged <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/our-sybil-resistance-strategy-for-gg20/18524">sybil resistance strategy</a>. To recap it briefly, we would continue to use COCM (Connection-Oriented Cluster Matching) as we had in GG20 &amp; GG22.</p>
<p>As explained in the post, and the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4311507" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">paper</a> which introduced this mechanism to the world, COCM is much less vulnerable to Sybil Attacks than ordinary QF because it reduces the matching of donors who look similar.</p>
<p>In addition, over the past few rounds, Passport‚Äôs Model-Based Detection system has yielded greater sybil resistance than the stamp-based system without any of the user friction. When used together, we believe these two tools produce the most sybil-resistant results we‚Äôve ever had.</p>
<p>There were some major updates made to Passport‚Äôs MBD system, which you can read more about <a href="https://docs.passport.xyz/building-with-passport/model-based-detection/available-models" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="connection-oriented-cluster-matching-cocm-12" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#connection-oriented-cluster-matching-cocm-12"></a>Connection-Oriented Cluster Matching (COCM)</h3>
<p>COCM is an approach within Gitcoin Grants that enhances Quadratic Funding by prioritizing projects with diverse support bases, helping to counteract sybil attacks and coordinated groups trying to unfairly influence funding distribution. Key elements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diversity Bonus: COCM increases matching funds for projects supported by a wide array of ‚Äútribes‚Äù or distinct groups, rewarding cross-group support and broad appeal.</li>
<li>Markov Chain Enhancement: Recent updates to COCM use a Markov chain approach to gauge connection strength between users and projects, providing stronger sybil resistance by analyzing indirect connections.</li>
<li>Funding Distribution: COCM‚Äôs design inherently shifts some funds from top projects to those in the ‚Äúlong tail,‚Äù enhancing the reach of smaller or niche projects.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="gitcoin-passports-model-based-detection-system-13" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#gitcoin-passports-model-based-detection-system-13"></a>Gitcoin Passport‚Äôs Model-Based Detection System</h3>
<p>The Gitcoin Passport team has implemented a model that evaluates on-chain activity to detect potential sybil accounts, enhancing funding fairness by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Address Probability Scoring: The model assigns each address a probability score, indicating whether it likely belongs to a genuine user or a sybil account.</li>
<li>Continuous Improvement: While the model sometimes mistakenly flags new users with limited on-chain history, the team is refining the dataset and expanding to include Layer 2 networks, effectively reducing sybil influence on funding results.</li>
</ul>
<p>These efforts together strengthen Gitcoin‚Äôs defenses against manipulation, helping to ensure fair distribution of funds to genuine community-supported projects.</p>
<h2><a name="code-of-conduct-reminder-14" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#code-of-conduct-reminder-14"></a>Code of Conduct Reminder</h2>
<p>As a reminder to all projects, <a href="https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/about-gitcoin/policy/understanding-potential-attack-vectors/bribery-quid-pro-quo" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">quid pro quo </a>is explicitly against <a href="https://grants-portal.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-grants-grantee-portal/gg19-eligibility" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">our agreement</a>. Providing an incentive or reward for individuals to donate to specific projects can affect your ability to participate in future rounds. If you see someone engaging in this type of behavior, please <a href="https://forms.gle/gjnz7mtCcd6aRTFw6" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">let us know.</a></p>
<p><em>We have removed Pheasant Network from matching distribution calculations, as this project clearly participated in Quid Pro Quo.</em></p>
<h2><a name="next-steps-15" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#next-steps-15"></a>Next Steps</h2>
<p>We plan to distribute the matching by November 22, after the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WMFW6YrLIodpKoGcE79Vgf9vgBXXnC-JXw2w1Veds8s/edit?gid=1613004131#gid=1613004131" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">results</a> are open for discussion for five days.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs worth noting that GG22 <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gg22-pre-ratification/19501">pre-approved the matching fund</a> to be paid out before results were posted. This means that the payout process to grantees will occur faster, after this post has been left open for community input.</p>
<p>We are also hosting an internal retro in the following weeks and will publish further results and learnings. And as always, a detailed blog post will be published on the day that payouts are distributed.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre also always looking for direct feedback from the community on which improvements would make GG23 even better. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to let us know!</p>
