The voting mechanism was crafted to reflect the degree of user involvement in GG18:

## The Importance of Community Engagement

Running this Jokerace has demonstrated the immense value of community engagement. Not only do we get direct feedback from those who use our platform the most, but we also foster a sense of collective ownership and contribution. This sets the stage for more dynamic and responsive engagement cycles, ultimately benefiting everyone involved.

## Looking Forward to GG19

The feedback received has helped to set the wheels in motion for what promises to be an even more successful GG19. We'll be closely evaluating these top-voted ideas and considering them in our development roadmap. Stay tuned for further product and program updates, and keep your eyes peeled for more Jokeraces in the future!

Thanks again to everyone who participated for your invaluable input. Hereâ€™s to making Gitcoin an even better platform, together! :star_struck:

Jokerace - GG18 Feedback/Feature Request Contest - Summary & Insights
FractalVisions

            <p>Honestly Iâ€™m sad that we missed the opportunity to participate in this and wish we had been notified sooner.</p>
<p>Perhaps even a PGN drop to all the grantees of GG18 would have been a smart way to onboard everyone to the network with a high voting <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/ballot_box.png?v=12" title=":ballot_box:" class="emoji" alt=":ballot_box:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> turnout. Providing a faucet would have increased the excitement of all the participants.</p>
<p>Bridging to PGN is painful because I had to bridge my funds from either Arbitrum or Optimism back to Eth main net before bridging to PGN in the most backwards compatible L2 bridge process I have ever had to complete in order to participate. In fact I gave up because gas <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/fuelpump.png?v=12" title=":fuelpump:" class="emoji" alt=":fuelpump:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> fees were too high at the time.</p>
<p>It wasnâ€™t until I submitted my Gitcoin Citizen application that I forced myself to bridge <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/bridge_at_night.png?v=12" title=":bridge_at_night:" class="emoji" alt=":bridge_at_night:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> over funds finally to PGN.</p>
<p>The first time I didnâ€™t send enough and ran out of gas <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/fuelpump.png?v=12" title=":fuelpump:" class="emoji" alt=":fuelpump:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> after my first or second transaction while editing my grant. So then I had to bridge again from L2 &gt; L1 &gt; L2 in order to complete my application.</p>
<p>Imagine the friction that people feel when bridging from L1 to L2 and then multiple that by a few times. That is the amount of friction this caused which demotivates any regular user from participating.</p>
<p>Let alone if a project received a majority of their matching funds on Optimism in the last round how did you expect them to bridge their funds over to PGN ?</p>
<p>Was there no consideration for those who already have funds on L2 from the donations on Optimism ?</p>

<p>I wonder if revisiting bounty programs might make sense to action on some of these community raised suggestions that donâ€™t fit easily into the Grants Stack teamâ€™s roadmap?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the tweet shoutout, I greatly enjoyed the jokerace!  I also loved reading the other suggestions.</p>
<p>The biggest room for improvement is increasing voter turnout. Itâ€™s a legitimately hard question on how to do so, especially as most havenâ€™t bridged to PGN before and it seemed trivial asking them to do so only for this competition.</p>
<p>I also thought it absurd that by default i had to pay $0.3-$0.5 in gas fees for every project i voted for <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/exploding_head.png?v=12" title=":exploding_head:" class="emoji" alt=":exploding_head:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> However, by going to advanced settings and putting gas limit as 0.00000001 gwei i could push the transaction through for free <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/shushing_face.png?v=12" title=":shushing_face:" class="emoji" alt=":shushing_face:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p>Oh yay! I won the race! <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>Seriously though, I have always imagined a recommender system for Gitcoin and it would definitely be a part of my donation selection workflow.  Iâ€™d give a little to the top grants, a little to the smaller grants, and then Iâ€™d use the recommender system to find the a rank ordered list of grants that match closely with my interests at that moment.</p>

            <p>Jokerace is a great tool for community driven feature development and Iâ€™m glad to see this was useful here. It would be helpful to give these rounds more promotion on forums as well as other internal channels to gather more feedback.</p>

            <p>Thanks so much for posting this and running the joke race <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/koday">@koday</a> !</p>
<p>I love the idea of a recommender app from <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/omnianalytics">@omnianalytics</a> . We donâ€™t currently have this on the Grants Stack roadmap but if there are community members who are interesting in building it â€“ Iâ€™d fund it. Please let me know if you are interested!</p>
<p>We also have several improvements coming to the grants experience for the next round, and I think weâ€™ll be able to address the idea from <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/tekr0x.eth">@Tekr0x.eth</a> too!</p>

<p>Running this Jokerace has demonstrated the immense value of community engagement. Not only do we get direct feedback from those who use our platform the most, but we also foster a sense of collective ownership and contribution. This sets the stage for more dynamic and responsive engagement cycles, ultimately benefiting everyone involved.</p>

<p>The feedback received has helped to set the wheels in motion for what promises to be an even more successful GG19. Weâ€™ll be closely evaluating these top-voted ideas and considering them in our development roadmap. Stay tuned for further product and program updates, and keep your eyes peeled for more Jokeraces in the future!</p>
