    <h1>[S19 Proposal Amended] Passport S19 Budget Request</h1>


<h2>S18 Milestone Update</h2>


We made a lot of progress against our top 2 milestones of _Passport Holder Experience Improvements_ and _GTC Staking Improvements_ driving significant gains in the growth of both, largely due to our BD efforts (thank you Azeem) and our inclusion in the Linea campaign. We’ve already exceeded our end of S19 GTC staking target by an additional 67%!!

We’re behind schedule with onchain scoring which we thought would launch in June. The delay was caused by spending several weeks on scaling initiatives as we ramped quickly in volume numbers, nearly 4xing our total Passport holders and improving the effectiveness of our stamps and scoring models. We believe we can improve this going forward by doing a better job of publishing the [roadmap](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15745RJWTkpurLIOOEuIeZp3Y249HBhGs4fIuj2LjQ8Q/edit?usp=sharing), breaking down, and estimating work. The good news is that we’re planning to launch onchain Passports Aug 30th on Optimism Layer 2. We’ll continue to follow EAS and rollout to all L2s which have EAS including PGN.

For additional details on past work and plans please see previous budgets for [S17](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s17-proposal-integrated-gitcoin-passport-budget-request/12727) and the [S18 & S19](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gitcoin-passport-workstream-season-18-19-budget-request/14121) proposal 

**Budget Update**

S19 plan at the beginning of the budgeting cycle was $589,846 for which we had a core team of 11 people on 

Passport across Product, Design, Engineering, Devrel and Ops support. Cognizant of Passport's fundamental nature as a data-centric product, we've adjusted our budget to $494,116, a reduction of 16%. 

As part of this realignment, we're prioritizing resources towards data analysis by adding a dedicated data science role, even while streamlining our development team. This decision is driven by our conviction that data expertise can unlock significant value for us, enhancing identity verification mechanisms, improving stamp curation, refining scoring models, and strengthening overall analytics. This strategic shift enables us to extract more value from data while continuing to meet our operational and product objectives. The Gitcoin Passport workstream is carried forward by the following:

7 full time contributors



* 4 Developers
* 1 Product manager
* 1 Data Scientist
* 1 Workstream Lead

6 part time contributors (or part time on the workstream)



* 2 Support
* 1 Design
* 2 DevRel
* 1 DevOps

In addition to the headcount reductions in this budget we have also significantly reduced the DevRel budget by 50% which will reduce our ability to fund bounties and hack-a-thons, but we believe it was important to get to > 20% reduction before we incorporated the dedicated data science role for Passport.

This is the amended funding proposal for the Gitcoin Passport workstream requesting funding for Season S19 (1 Aug 2023 through 31 October 2023). 

We invite you to offer feedback, ask questions and help us identify any blindspots we may have. Coordination starts at the governance layer, and we need you to make us better!

<h2>Amount</h2>


Passport is requesting 535,000GTC* = $529,451 for S19, assuming 0.99 USD/GTC, excluding reserves and rolled over amounts.

_*The amount of GTC requested and the value of the reserves will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally using the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average, whichever is lower._

<h2>Budget Breakdown</h2>


**Breakdown staffing, contracting, operational expenses**

We have tried to be as comprehensive as possible for expenses we foresee without also padding our budget beyond what is necessary. We have a team of 13 people for Passport across Product, Design, Engineering, Devrel, Ops, and Support.

_* Any and all revenue generated during the past season will flow back to the DAO treasury or will be rolled over to the next season._

_During the season we will transparently report to CSDO and Stewards on revenue plus efforts to remediate currency fluctuations and report on these in the next budget request.  _

We greatly value your feedback and invite you to contribute in specific areas. We seek suggestions for integration partners, introductions to potential on-chain pilot programs, and participation in user interviews. Your ideas for novel use cases that could expand Gitcoin Passport's reach are always welcome. Thank you for your time and insights!

CoachJonathan

            <p>I will be voting in favor of this budget.</p>
<p>The entire Passport team has done a great job addressing challenges as they arise. If I could give this team more money, I would. We have amazing engineers, fantastic product managers and dedicated marketers/designers who are going to catapult this product into a phase of mass adoption. I would like to make sure all of that work can continue unimpeded.</p>

<p><em>*The amount of GTC requested and the value of the reserves will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally using the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average, whichever is lower.</em></p>
<h2>Budget Breakdown</h2>
<p><strong>Breakdown staffing, contracting, operational expenses</strong></p>
<p>We have tried to be as comprehensive as possible for expenses we foresee without also padding our budget beyond what is necessary. We have a team of 13 people for Passport across Product, Design, Engineering, Devrel, Ops, and Support.</p>
