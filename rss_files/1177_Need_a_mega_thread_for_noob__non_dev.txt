            <p>TBH the best tool is to search for how Governance tokens operate, Gitcoin is a fork of UNI, which is a fork of COMP, and we use the GovernorAlpha.</p>
<p>Even as a non dev, its crucial to understand how these tools work, delegating your vote, etc.</p>
<p>Gitcoin has created a great onboarding for users through the delegate/claim process.</p>
<p>If you have specific things you are looking to learn, I would highly suggest joining the Gitcoin discord and also posting about what you want to learn into the Gitcoin town square.</p>
