2. If you‚Äôre a workstream contributor please fill out [this quick survey](https://dvsvwyompza.typeform.com/to/s5s1J428) for the Year-in-Review!

### üî• Hot Topics:

* [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary) [proposes](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-for-a-weekly-grants-2-0-progress-thread/10612/) a weekly Grants 2.0 progress thread to ‚Äúcreate a drumbeat of progress‚Äù and ‚Äúallow for course correction (if needed) early.‚Äù [Leon](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/leone/summary) quickly [delivers](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/weekly-grants-2-0-update/10625/). 
The thread highlights that dPopp is well on its way to having an MVP by GR14 and has a [demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tsgcrGoO6gQQBTsfSWm3P-hnLacvP8Aa/view) available. In addition, the Grants Hub ‚Äúaims to be production-ready by July 1st when we‚Äôll prompt projects in Gitcoin Grants to migrate over‚Äù and also has a [demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WUDBWIEBvwiQq0xWr368IPdlZCWsTkRo/view) available.

* [Annika](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/annika/summary)‚Äôs post on [GR14 Round Structure and Grants Eligibility](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gr14-round-structure-grants-eligibility-update/10632/) has forty-one responses in just three days! Much of the discussion revolves around whether grants with tokens should be eligible. Several posters point out that NFTs are tokens. [Connor](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/connor/summary) succinctly [summarizes](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gr14-round-structure-grants-eligibility-update/10632/42) the opposing viewpoints:
  * ‚ÄúOption 1: No token policy stays, but projects that want to can apply for an exception and can be approved after a review (case by case basis)
  * Option 2: Token policy is updated with some general guidelines and thresholds, but projects still are applying anyway when opening a grant and are always subject to review and approval (case by case basis)‚Äù

* [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary) points out that [GitcoinDAO‚Äôs starting conditions are different from other DAOs](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoindao-starting-conditions-are-different-than-other-daos/10603) because it started as a corporation. While DAOs can start as a ‚Äústructureless primordial soup (like yearn)‚Äù they need not so long as they ‚Äúprogressively decentralize over time.‚Äù One consequence of starting as a US tech company is that [salary compensation](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/dao-compensation-sustainability/10604) is higher than other DAOs. Owocki questions if GitcoinDAO can continue to pay these rates without a model for financial sustainability.

* [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary) outlines a vision for [GitcoinDAO‚Äôs final form](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoindaos-final-form-maximum-coordination/10605) which starts with a clear north star of empowering ‚Äúcommunities to build & fund their shared needs.‚Äù Our ability to do this will be expanded by Grants 2.0 which will make Gitcoin a ProtocolDAO and be built on ‚Äúa highly liquid grants registry, which can be interoperable with other registries of grants.‚Äù By coordinating with other registries or DAOs, we scale our Impact Network, and ‚Äúthe end result is a DAO of DAOs. A densely integrated network of projects and contributors that all rise and fall together.‚Äù This is ‚ÄúMaximum Coordination.‚Äù

* [Elliot](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/elliott/summary) from [Llama](https://llama.xyz/) shares the March and April 2022 [treasury report](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-financial-reporting/8867/7) showing a treasury with over 99% GTC, roughly 8.8M tokens, worth $40.1M at time of calculation. Using today‚Äôs prices this shows a treasury balance of $23.7M

* [Sean](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/seanmac/summary) shares a [tribute](https://twitter.com/smacmannis/status/1526634706170589184) in memory of GitcoinDAO‚Äôs contributor Jemimah Jones who tragically passed from complications due to sickle cell anemia. Jemimah [once said](https://jemimahjones.medium.com/the-worlds-best-workplace-b1e44c4ef183) of GitcoinDAO "I‚Äôve discovered the world‚Äôs best workplace, guaranteed to make you laugh, cry (good tears), and scream to the skies that you‚Äôre the happiest person on Earth." Sean asks ‚ÄúCan we become the "workplace" that Jemimah imagined we could be? Can we challenge ourselves to believe as strongly in ourselves as she did?‚Äù We miss you Jemimah.

## üó≥Ô∏è GitcoinDAO Governance Overview:

## [üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Workstream Discussion](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/workstream-discussion/9)

### [üå± Public Goods Funding](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Public-Goods-4ccd579f433c4dff9d8952314468d6e8)

* Our [post on GR14 Round Structure](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gr14-round-structure-grants-eligibility-update/10632) is now live. We propose keeping the round structure split into three components:
  * A main pool (of up to $1M),
  * Roughly ten ecosystem rounds (including one focused on Ethereum protocol devs),
  * Three cause rounds (climate, advocacy, DEI).
* We also recommend removing the criteria that grants must not have a token in order to be eligible for funding. In doing so, we continue moving in the direction of the community answering ‚Äòwhat is a public good‚Äô through what they choose to fund. We will gather feedback in the forum, then revise, and move this proposal to Snapshot.

* We are excited to share that we‚Äôve secured just over $2 Million in funding for Grants Round 14 and have another $500k in outstanding, potential deals.

### [üöÄ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-prototyping-workstream-moonshot-budget-request-q4-2021/8785) [Moonshot Collective](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Moonshot-Collective-ffa78f44a0de412cb607f9b69d3a376f)

* We recorded a [demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tsgcrGoO6gQQBTsfSWm3P-hnLacvP8Aa/view?usp=sharing) of our dPOPP (decentralized proof of personhood passport) project!

* We‚Äôve begun work on researching and learning about conviction voting to explore how it could be used at Gitcoin. We are interested in increasing steward engagement and creating new mechanisms to incentivize active involvement.

* We are expanding our community to include hackathon winners and ensure MC is the core builder community for Gitcoin

* [Episode 14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo5mtvIBM48) of the [Green Pill Podcast](https://availableon.com/greenpill) hosted by [Kevin Owocki](https://twitter.com/owocki) is live! Special guest [Ale Borda](https://twitter.com/Aleborda21), co-author of the [ImpactDAO Book](https://store.gitcoin.co/products/impactdao-book-digital-edition), exudes regen in this discussion about what ImpactDAOs are, how to get involved with them, and why she entered the Web3 space.

### [üíô Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Fraud-Detection-Defense-2bde13c0b8e74fda81435d94e49e2703)

* We conducted a [snapshot survey](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0x332237cf15443ea727e914431b9d916aa2b72d421ce1fa2f8165cc7774dbde0e) of the squads and principles of our workstream to gather consensus on what is most important to the DAO. We‚Äôve updated our [season 14 budget proposal](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-fdd-season-14-budget-request/10658) with this feedback. We are giving stewards granular options on how much to fund us from the bare minimum needed for round execution ($223k) to the amount needed for improvement ($370k), innovation ($405k), or expansion of the workstream ($465k). The most expensive of these options is still a 17% budget reduction from our initial proposal.

* [Sirlupinwatson](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/sirlupinwatson/summary) shares [Learning Sybil Resistance (Work-In-Progress) Part.3 ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/learning-sybil-resistance-work-in-progress-part-3/10644)where he breaks down different types of sybil attacks and how to defend against them. A sybil attack occurs when ‚Äúone person creates multiple identities in order to masquerade as another user or group of users.‚Äù Sybil attacks can be executed by using bot accounts, posting on multiple accounts, leaving fake reviews, and submitting fake votes. Sybil attacks can be defended against using trusted identities that a person can only have one of or by using just-in-time authentication.

### [üé® Merch, Memes & Marketing](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Merch-Memes-and-Marketing-60cc693f0fe14be1879a05587922c8a3)

* Did you catch the [Wired Magazine article](https://www.wired.com/story/web3-paradise-crypto-arcade/) about EthDenver featuring Gitcoin and Owocki?

* We‚Äôre ramping up for GR14 and have prepared designs with a theme of ‚ÄúReFi Summer.‚Äù We are also launching the beginning of our marketing campaign

* We‚Äôre building out an awesome year-in-review for GitcoinDAO‚Äôs first birthday!

* We‚Äôre developing our content strategy for the new season with a particular focus on the upcoming launch of Grants 2.0

### [‚òÄÔ∏è DAO Operations](https://gitcoin.notion.site/DAO-Ops-84f425e281ae49579a2b4acf0bad5dd5)

* CSDO has ratified a draft version of GitcoinDAO‚Äôs ‚ÄòPurpose and Essential Intents‚Äô. This will be shared on the forum in the coming days, for review by our stewards and community.

* We are working to improve our main internal communication channels: [discord](http://discord.gg/gitcoin) and [discourse](http://gov.gitcoin.co/). Our discord upgrade plan has been ratified and will be implemented in the coming week. Our discourse [forum improvement project](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-forum-improvement-project/10314/12) is identifying the most clear and concise categories to use.

Much of the discussion revolves around whether grants with tokens should be eligible. Several posters point out that NFTs are tokens. <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/connor/summary">Connor</a> succinctly <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gr14-round-structure-grants-eligibility-update/10632/42">summarizes</a> the opposing viewpoints:</p>
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúOption 1: No token policy stays, but projects that want to can apply for an exception and can be approved after a review (case by case basis)</li>
<li>Option 2: Token policy is updated with some general guidelines and thresholds, but projects still are applying anyway when opening a grant and are always subject to review and approval (case by case basis)‚Äù</li>

<p><a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary">Owocki</a> points out that <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoindao-starting-conditions-are-different-than-other-daos/10603">GitcoinDAO‚Äôs starting conditions are different from other DAOs</a> because it started as a corporation. While DAOs can start as a ‚Äústructureless primordial soup (like yearn)‚Äù they need not so long as they ‚Äúprogressively decentralize over time.‚Äù One consequence of starting as a US tech company is that <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/dao-compensation-sustainability/10604">salary compensation</a> is higher than other DAOs. Owocki questions if GitcoinDAO can continue to pay these rates without a model for financial sustainability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary">Owocki</a> outlines a vision for <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoindaos-final-form-maximum-coordination/10605">GitcoinDAO‚Äôs final form</a> which starts with a clear north star of empowering ‚Äúcommunities to build &amp; fund their shared needs.‚Äù Our ability to do this will be expanded by Grants 2.0 which will make Gitcoin a ProtocolDAO and be built on ‚Äúa highly liquid grants registry, which can be interoperable with other registries of grants.‚Äù By coordinating with other registries or DAOs, we scale our Impact Network, and ‚Äúthe end result is a DAO of DAOs. A densely integrated network of projects and contributors that all rise and fall together.‚Äù This is ‚ÄúMaximum Coordination.‚Äù</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gr14-round-structure-grants-eligibility-update/10632">post on GR14 Round Structure</a> is now live. We propose keeping the round structure split into three components:</p>
<ul>
<li>A main pool (of up to $1M),</li>
<li>Roughly ten ecosystem rounds (including one focused on Ethereum protocol devs),</li>
<li>Three cause rounds (climate, advocacy, DEI).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also recommend removing the criteria that grants must not have a token in order to be eligible for funding. In doing so, we continue moving in the direction of the community answering ‚Äòwhat is a public good‚Äô through what they choose to fund. We will gather feedback in the forum, then revise, and move this proposal to Snapshot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are excited to share that we‚Äôve secured just over $2 Million in funding for Grants Round 14 and have another $500k in outstanding, potential deals.</p>

A sybil attack occurs when ‚Äúone person creates multiple identities in order to masquerade as another user or group of users.‚Äù Sybil attacks can be executed by using bot accounts, posting on multiple accounts, leaving fake reviews, and submitting fake votes. Sybil attacks can be defended against using trusted identities that a person can only have one of or by using just-in-time authentication.</p>
