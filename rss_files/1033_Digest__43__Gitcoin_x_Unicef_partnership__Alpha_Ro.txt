**As we head into Winter, GitcoinDAO looks to 2023, with upcoming “Alpha Rounds” and hackathons, a grants protocol launch in Spring, and [an exciting new partnership with Unicef](https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-unicef-qf-collaboration-pilot**)**!

Gitcoin [has partnered with Unicef](https://twitter.com/gitcoin/status/1594751121444085760?s=20&t=IBa0thDqPS2wxle6GpZk0g) to run an Alpha Round to fund projects that address gaps in financial access, education and literacy, environment, and public health. This round will be the first of five test rounds run on our new grants protocol (currently in closed beta) as part of Gitcoin’s Alpha test season.

*There is a Twitter Space happening on Tuesday, 12/6, to kick off the Alpha Round with Unicef. Follow the [Gitcoin Twitter account here](https://twitter.com/gitcoin).*

**In DAO news, we recently approved [five-out-of-five budget requests](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth) for GitcoinDAO workstreams.**

With the bear market, some Stewards and community members [have expressed concern over the DAO’s spending](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/is-gitcoin-over-its-skis-should-we-hold-spending-flat-while-addressing-unavoidable-risks/11870/11), and have expressed the desire for the DAO to reign in costs as we go into 2023, an indefinite bear market, and a looming global economic recession.

With the acceptance of all workstream budget requests, the DAO will continue to operate as usual in S16, preparing for the launch of our upcoming Alpha Test Rounds, and continuing to build grants protocols.

**Additionally GitcoinDAO continues to support Web3 builders via hackathons and initiatives, including:**

* Hackathons hosted on Gitcoin–[currently there are six hackathons happening on Gitcoin!](https://gitcoin.co/hackathons)
* Innovative new initiatives like [“Buidl in Public”](https://twitter.com/GitcoinFam/status/1595189575047159809?s=20&t=QdUOooArwA8pfWa-yjITUA), where Gary Sheng works live with a single Web3 builder each week to help them create viable growth strategies to find product-market-fit and to grow their community and user base!
* Current and Upcoming Alpha Rounds, including the [Fantom Alpha Round](https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/announcing-the-fantom-alpha-round) (submissions open ‘til 12/4), and the upcoming [Unicef Alpha Round](https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-unicef-qf-collaboration-pilot)! Both of these rounds are being run on Gitcoin’s new [grants protocol](https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/introduction-to-grants-protocol), which is currently in closed beta.

  * [“Gitcoin <> UNICEF: A powerful Quadratic Funding collaboration pilot”](https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-unicef-qf-collaboration-pilot) – Gitcoin will launch its first-ever Quadratic Funding round on its new grants protocol (currently in closed beta) in collaboration with UNICEF’s Office of Innovation. Between 12/9-16, 2022, Gitcoin will facilitate a Quadratic Funding grants round for a select group of 10 impact-focused, innovative projects from around the world—including Nepal, Kenya, Argentina, Brazil, and the Philippines. This launch signals the beginning of Gitcoin’s transition to a decentralized protocol that will allow any community to coordinate its own grants funding round.

  * [“Maximizing success as a grantee through collaboration”](https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/maximizing-success-as-a-grantee-through-collaboration) – [Joe Brewer](https://co.linkedin.com/in/joe-brewer-4957925) is the founder of [Earth Regenerators](https://earthregenerators.org/), a global network of 4,000 members interested in regenerating the planet through [on-the-ground projects](https://earthregenerators.org/on-ground-projects/) and a [study group](https://earthregenerators.org/earth-regenerators-study-group/).

](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/epowell101)This post was originally posted on November 7th of this year. epowell101 asks if it “may be prudent to reduce speed and derisk the business while minimizing the ongoing reduction of our runway”. Essentially, should GitcoinDAO should [cut spending](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/is-gitcoin-over-its-skis-should-we-hold-spending-flat-while-addressing-unavoidable-risks/11870/7?u=alexdwagner) to ensure the continued existence of the DAO through an indefinite bear market? epowell101 suggests that implementing a system for [tracking product development like Grafana](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/is-gitcoin-over-its-skis-should-we-hold-spending-flat-while-addressing-unavoidable-risks/11870/10?u=alexdwagner) may help with tracking costs.

<p><strong>As we head into Winter, GitcoinDAO looks to 2023, with upcoming “Alpha Rounds” and hackathons, a grants protocol launch in Spring, and <a href="https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-unicef-qf-collaboration-pilot**" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">an exciting new partnership with Unicef</a></strong>!</p>
<p>Gitcoin <a href="https://twitter.com/gitcoin/status/1594751121444085760?s=20&amp;t=IBa0thDqPS2wxle6GpZk0g" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">has partnered with Unicef</a> to run an Alpha Round to fund projects that address gaps in financial access, education and literacy, environment, and public health. This round will be the first of five test rounds run on our new grants protocol (currently in closed beta) as part of Gitcoin’s Alpha test season.</p>
<p><em>There is a Twitter Space happening on Tuesday, 12/6, to kick off the Alpha Round with Unicef. Follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/gitcoin" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Gitcoin Twitter account here</a>.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>In DAO news, we recently approved <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">five-out-of-five budget requests</a> for GitcoinDAO workstreams.</strong></p>
<p>With the bear market, some Stewards and community members <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/is-gitcoin-over-its-skis-should-we-hold-spending-flat-while-addressing-unavoidable-risks/11870/11">have expressed concern over the DAO’s spending</a>, and have expressed the desire for the DAO to reign in costs as we go into 2023, an indefinite bear market, and a looming global economic recession.</p>
<p>With the acceptance of all workstream budget requests, the DAO will continue to operate as usual in S16, preparing for the launch of our upcoming Alpha Test Rounds, and continuing to build grants protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Additionally GitcoinDAO continues to support Web3 builders via hackathons and initiatives, including:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hackathons hosted on Gitcoin–<a href="https://gitcoin.co/hackathons" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">currently there are six hackathons happening on Gitcoin!</a>
</li>
<li>Innovative new initiatives like <a href="https://twitter.com/GitcoinFam/status/1595189575047159809?s=20&amp;t=QdUOooArwA8pfWa-yjITUA" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">“Buidl in Public”</a>, where Gary Sheng works live with a single Web3 builder each week to help them create viable growth strategies to find product-market-fit and to grow their community and user base!</li>
<li>Current and Upcoming Alpha Rounds, including the <a href="https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/announcing-the-fantom-alpha-round" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Fantom Alpha Round</a> (submissions open ‘til 12/4), and the upcoming <a href="https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-unicef-qf-collaboration-pilot" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Unicef Alpha Round</a>!

</a>This post was originally posted on November 7th of this year. epowell101 asks if it “may be prudent to reduce speed and derisk the business while minimizing the ongoing reduction of our runway”. Essentially, should GitcoinDAO should <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/is-gitcoin-over-its-skis-should-we-hold-spending-flat-while-addressing-unavoidable-risks/11870/7">cut spending</a> to ensure the continued existence of the DAO through an indefinite bear market? epowell101 suggests that implementing a system for <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/is-gitcoin-over-its-skis-should-we-hold-spending-flat-while-addressing-unavoidable-risks/11870/10">tracking product development like Grafana</a> may help with tracking costs. <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/myceliumcoordinator">Myceliumcoordinator</a> compares Gitcoin to Giveth <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/is-gitcoin-over-its-skis-should-we-hold-spending-flat-while-addressing-unavoidable-risks/11870/11">in terms of spending and shipping of protocols</a> over similar time periods and asks for a better explanation of what the true utility of the GTC token is.</p>
