https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/citizens-forward-llm-rfp-pathway-1-specific-deliverable/17979
    tl;dr: This RFP is shared as part of the recently launched [Citizens Forward](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gitcoin-s-citizen-grants-program/17470#citizens-forward-26) program. The program seeks to involve the Gitcoin community in assisting with pre-defined projects through Request for Proposals (RFPs). You can find more information about the program on the portal [here](https://gitcoin.notion.site/52bb700932924eeb9c2fef9f04951a68?pvs=25). If you‚Äôre interested in applying, you may submit your application on Grants Stack before the submission deadline (see section 7 for details).

## 1. RFP Objective:

We aim to develop a system that not only simplifies the discovery of public goods but also personalizes the experience for users, fostering greater engagement, transparency, and accessibility. This initiative is central to our mission, embodying our dedication to supporting public goods through innovative technological integration.

This objective is divided into two separate RFPs. Pathway 1, this post, focuses on specific LLM-enabled features for grant discovery. To submit applications for Pathway 2 focusing on open innovation and creative uses of LLMs, click [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/citizens-forward-llm-rfp-pathway-2-open-innovation/17980).

## 2. Pathway 1: Specific Deliverable

* Interactive Visualization Tools: Creation of dynamic visualization interfaces for intuitive exploration of grantee projects.
* User-Centric Discovery Process: A streamlined, LLM-powered interface that helps new users navigate the vast landscape of public goods available for funding. This system will employ a sophisticated branching logic to guide users based on their interests, preferences, and the impact they wish to make.

* Type of Public Good: Categories or domains of interest (including the ability to cluster similar grants).
* Grantee Recommendations: Based on previous donations or onchain activity
