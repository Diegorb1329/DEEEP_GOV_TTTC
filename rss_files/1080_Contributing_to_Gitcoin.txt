    Hey everyone! 

Our team of Web 3 product builders is looking for a way to participate in the community more actively and help with Web development. We already have good prior Crypto experience with one of the leading protocols. However, we don't have our own proposal for a grant to make, but would rather like to participate in implementing ideas. Is there a way we could get into some sort of RFPs or something similar to that? Would appreciate that :relieved:
