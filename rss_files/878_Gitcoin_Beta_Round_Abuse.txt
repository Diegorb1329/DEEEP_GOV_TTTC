https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-beta-round-abuse/14918
    Hi,

We saw that the funds donated during the Gitcoin Beta round are sent straight to the wallet address specified during contract deployment. What's stopping a few bad actors with Gitcoin passports from cycling the donations through a CEX and re-donating to themselves to maximise the matching pool? For example,

Donate $10 â†’ Receive $10 â†’ Cycle through a CEX â†’ Donate the same $10 again â†’ Rinse & Repeat

Is this possible?

            <p>I have also been trying to figure out what these antisybil measures are. I am unable to see any and I have found many instances throughout this last grant round.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Can someone elaborate on what these anti-Sybil measures are? In particular, how can they catch the following scenario:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Donate $10 â†’ Receive $10 â†’ Cycle through a CEX â†’ Donate the same $10 again â†’ Rinse &amp; Repeat</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last I checked, anyone can donate multiple times to a project and there is no way to associate transactions across CEXs. For example, if I like a project a lot, I can donate 1000$ from my passport address to it, ask the team to send the 1000$ that they just received to a CEX (to my exchange address of course), send it from the CEX back to my passport address, donate the same 1000$ again. Repeat. Perhaps I wouldnâ€™t want to raise suspicion and only do it a few times. But a team can have access to multiple passport accounts and this can have an exaggerated effect.</p>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/inplco">@inplco</a></p>
<p>It is <strong>absolutely</strong> forbidden action for funding (donating) to their own project. This is a sybil action, and would be identified and marked by anti-sybil check.</p>
<p>For more info, would like to invite gitcoin team to introduce.</p>
