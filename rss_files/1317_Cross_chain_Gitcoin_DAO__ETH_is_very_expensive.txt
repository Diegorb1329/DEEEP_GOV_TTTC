Cross-chain Gitcoin DAO? ETH is very expensive
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/cross-chain-gitcoin-dao-eth-is-very-expensive/10313
    Ethereum definitely isn't the best blockchain to exist, and likely won't ever be. I wonder if there is consideration to become cross-chain, like say, developing on/for [Algorand](https://www.algorand.com/)?

Everything on Ethereum is so expensive. I've spent a good chunk of my income from the DAO on gas. I wonder if moving some of the treasury over to a stablecoin pegged to GTC on other chains is a good idea.

L2s are the common rebuttal, but they've all got their own set of challenges and problems with the "blockchain trilemma" that [Algorand solves quite elegantly](https://www.algorand.com/resources/blog/silvio-micali-lex-fridman-algorand-and-the-blockchain-trilemma). It's also pretty impressively easy to use, and mobile-first.
