    # Public Goods Funding S17 Workstream Budget Proposal

Thank you to the whole PGF workstream for their help shaping this proposal draft and all the work put in to push us forward as a DAO in S16. A particular shout out to @Maxwell for all his help shaping this budget.  
 
# Essential Intents

During S17, we will continue to prioritize the following EIs
* EI1: Protocol Adoption
* EI2: Financial Sustainability
* EI3: DAO Organization
* EI4: Grants Program Success


# TL;DR

Our S16 goals were: 
* Launch Gitcoin Protocol Alpha Round Successfully
* Transition 90% of selected & willing grantees successfully for Alpha round to the protocol
* Transition Partners successfully to the protocol
* Determine future of the program + services strategy + structure
* Plan Partner + community retreat in support of protocol launch

PGF has remained on track to hit these goals. The two caveats are that (1) we’re still aligning on details of the services strategy and communicating that more clearly to the broader community (2) we haven’t fully scheduled and transitioned partners to the protocol. That said, we are in conversation with partners about scheduling rounds from March onward after we launch the beta of Allo Protocol and start testing a fee for service model. We are also in discussions about running featured rounds in April when we launch the next iteration of the Gitcoin Program during our Beta period.

> We’d also like to celebrate behind the scenes work that exceeded our goals. We launched the UNICEF Innovation round in Q4 2022 that raised over 130 ETH (50 ETH from UNICEF Innovation and 80 ETH from 15,500 Donors)!!



In addition, a less tangible highlight is how the PGF team has become a tight and highly efficient unit. It wasn’t easy to reorg the team but we’re down a total of 50% of contributors over the past 3 seasons to 9 FT and 2 PT contributors and one contributor on leave (@annika we’re excited to have you back soon). We’re building a strong culture of talented, highly effective, and dedicated contributors.

Our main goals for S17 are twofold: 
**Protocol growth readiness and Gitcoin Grants Program readiness.**

**Our overarching priority in S17 is to continue setting up the protocol for successful adoption with solid infrastructure to drive sustainable growth.**  

Overall we will
1.	Developing runbooks and guides for communities to use to run QF rounds and drive adoption
2.	Running test rounds with partners to onboard and enable them to manage their own programs permissionlessly
3.	Defining and launching the Core Gitcoin Grants Program in April, to embrace our DAO's goal of funding public goods with our protocol
4.	Defining and providing a paid services offering to early adopters until a fully self serve approach is viable



# Amount

PGF's total request will be **$606,000 USD** for S17. A 30% decrease from last season. Accounting for 60+ day reserves and current reserves we are requesting **$337,903 USD** for S17. A 68% decrease from last season. 


***1)** The amount of GTC requested and the value of the reserves will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally using the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average, whichever is lower.*

***2)** The Treasury Request amount is an estimate using the price of $2.10 GTC to calculate the total of the reserves rolled over from Season 16.*

            <p>As per my previous comment I am urging this workstream to become even more lean.</p>
<p>The only parts I would think need funding (in this market) is running the rounds and finding the partners.</p>
<p>The rest is just unnecessary.</p>
<p>To that end I will abstain from voting,</p>

            <p>This is only my second full budgeting cycle as a contributor to Gitcoin so I’m trying to read/understand each one especially at this critical stage as we move from impact to impact/protocol DAO.</p>
<p>First, really appreciate that this team has spent time and energy restructuring this team.</p>
<p>I also love seeing this team embracing a test and learn mentality that will allow us to swiftly identify what works/what doesn’t and move forward.</p>
<p>I’m also happy to see a partner prioritization strategy planned as I think this will enhance efficiency/effectiveness.</p>
<p>I see how the vision for getting program managers/groups on the protocol by bringing them in to the Festival but I’d love to better understand if we anticipate everyone who uses the Stack to therefore initially be a Festival participant or if we will be allowing/enabling autonomous rounds to run this season (totally get it if not, just curious for those asking if they can just spin up their own round now).</p>
<p>I see a lot of KPIs tied to number of partners and their relative size, which makes sense given our main audience focus being program managers at this time.</p>
<p>Last of my questions was pertaining to the Community Gathering - is this more of a sales play or a reward for a job well done? A thank you? Would love to understand the size of the partner commits we envision coming out of this, and if there are any other KPIs related to donors/grantees that could be tied to this (not sure how just saying) I’d love to see them. I’d also love to better understand where this cost falls within this budget.</p>
<p>In future seasons, I’d love to better understand how this relates to the grantees (and thereby donors) attracted/onboarded/converted/retained. Ultimately, and this is not just related to this budget but more broadly speaking, I’d love for us to tie audience-level insights and goals to product-level goals to the broader DAO level goals as they relate to specific metrics we collectively define.</p>
<p>Overall - and like I said, I still feel new to this process - looking at the budgets by workstream feels fragmented to me and I’d love to better understand how we look at the larger DAO wide budget first to then inform the workstream ones. If there’s something I can reference like this, appreciate someone sharing.</p>

            <p>Hey guys. For this gitcoin budget season I will be following a different approach. I am not happy with how many things have been going in gitcoin and the way budget reviews work so I will either be abstaining or voting No in most budget reviews.</p>
<p>Despite the budget cuts I still think the DAO is burning too much money and it needs to become more lean.</p>
<p>For example from here the only parts I would think need funding (in this market) is running the rounds and finding the partners. The rest is … nice … but unnecessary in this market.</p>

            <p>I am really impressed with how much you have cut the budget. Thank you for recognizing the market.</p>
<p>I’m in general supportive of this proposal, but I want to ask every workstream… what would happen if this proposal didn’t pass?</p>
<p>Not fear mongering, just a practical reality. What would “No” look like?</p>

            <p>I am supportive for PGF budget request, and the proposal is very clear and detailed!</p>
<p>When I first heard there were only 9 FT in PGF, I was shocked. You’re so brilliant team to move forward, in special for the transitions from cGrant to dGrant. (many challenges behind)</p>
<p>A minor request (the same to other WS), could we have a holistic history for all the budget?</p>
<p>E.g S13 ($xxx)<br>
S14 ($yyy)<br>
S15 ($zzz)<br>
S16 ($aaa)<br>
S17 …</p>

            <p>I am supportive of this budget proposal and initiatives planned for S17. I appreciate the clear linkage between the initiatives and the metrics. I also want to applaud this workstream for the success of the three alpha rounds on the new protocol. (I remember there being a lot of debate about the format of S16; now, in retrospect, it seems you made the right calls!)</p>
<p>Are there any top-line goals for the overall amount of PGF that Gitcoin allocates in S17? My understanding is that this team is expected to scale its impact without growing headcount. So it would be helpful to view this budget in the context of the DAO’s growth aspirations.</p>
<p>I am feeling very optimistic that Gitcoin will continue to find product-market-fit in S17!</p>

            <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/linda">@linda</a> I fully appreciate your concern. The only full-time potential hire is to replace a role that was let go so is not an addition but a replacement. The other roles are all consultative roles and no one that would be a full-time hire as I don’t want to increase burn consistently. That said, we’re trying to be creative and look across the DAO to get support for some of these initiatives and to stewards as advisors where possible to potentially avoid these part-time hires.</p>

</aside>
<p>I am appreciating how clear and succinct this is.</p>
<p>PGF went through some big changes over the last season and a half. Cutting staff by A LOT. At this point, with the community gathering before EthDenver along with the uncertainties of launching the protocols, I am 100% in support for this budget.</p>
<p>I would like to address one point, though I know PGF is keenly aware of it. This is intended for other readers of this budget and the replies here:</p>
<p>We as an organization need to commit to <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/thought-experiment-dao-strategy-and-subtraction/12534">subtraction mindset</a>.</p>
<p>I’m still very concerned about the “services trap” wherein we begin to see service revenue and decide that it is a best investment. When we increase our investment in services we quickly tip the scales towards being a service org which scales linearly requiring lots of hiring rather than an impact network or protocol DAO.</p>

            <p>Thanks for putting this together. It was well-documented and informative.</p>
<p>I am generally supportive of this request however given the market uncertainty as well as layoffs and hiring freezes across tech/crypto, are any of the new hires nice to have but not critical? I’m really hoping that the DAO (not just PGF) does not make new hires and increase burn during this market unless absolutely critical.</p>

            <p>Thanks so much Paige, appreciate the note of endorsement.</p>
<p>Regarding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the ‘Trusted Contributors’ section appears somewhat lean, at least at first glance. But since I have no context, I don’t claim to have the full picture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trusted Contributors in this sense just mean part-time team members. In general we’ve got a very lean team and want to make sure we’re not spending excess time managing a large bench of part-time contributors. Hope that helps answer your question.</p>

            <p>Bravo. Very clear breakdown and even with ‘new eyes’ easily understandable.<br>
It’s also quite ambitious and indicates that you intend to be very busy for S17.</p>
<p>Happy to see that a community gathering is planned and budgeted for. You guys deserve it and such things go a long ways towards team building and cementing strong partnerships!</p>
<p>This budget has my full support.  I have only one question, and that is, the ‘Trusted Contributors’ section appears somewhat lean, at least at first glance. But since I have no context, I don’t claim to have the full picture.</p>
<p>Overall: Really good work and budget breakdown - shows what a highly engaged and efficient team you are.</p>

            <h1><a name="public-goods-funding-s17-workstream-budget-proposal-1" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#public-goods-funding-s17-workstream-budget-proposal-1"></a>Public Goods Funding S17 Workstream Budget Proposal</h1>
<p>Thank you to the whole PGF workstream for their help shaping this proposal draft and all the work put in to push us forward as a DAO in S16. A particular shout out to <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/maxwell">@Maxwell</a> for all his help shaping this budget.</p>
<h1><a name="essential-intents-2" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#essential-intents-2"></a>Essential Intents</h1>
<p>During S17, we will continue to prioritize the following EIs</p>
<ul>
<li>EI1: Protocol Adoption</li>
<li>EI2: Financial Sustainability</li>
<li>EI3: DAO Organization</li>
<li>EI4: Grants Program Success</li>
</ul>
<h1><a name="tldr-3" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#tldr-3"></a>TL;DR</h1>
<p>Our S16 goals were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch Gitcoin Protocol Alpha Round Successfully</li>
<li>Transition 90% of selected &amp; willing grantees successfully for Alpha round to the protocol</li>
<li>Transition Partners successfully to the protocol</li>
<li>Determine future of the program + services strategy + structure</li>
<li>Plan Partner + community retreat in support of protocol launch</li>
</ul>
<p>PGF has remained on track to hit these goals. The two caveats are that (1) we’re still aligning on details of the services strategy and communicating that more clearly to the broader community (2) we haven’t fully scheduled and transitioned partners to the protocol. That said, we are in conversation with partners about scheduling rounds from March onward after we launch the beta of Allo Protocol and start testing a fee for service model. We are also in discussions about running featured rounds in April when we launch the next iteration of the Gitcoin Program during our Beta period.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’d also like to celebrate behind the scenes work that exceeded our goals. We launched the UNICEF Innovation round in Q4 2022 that raised over 130 ETH (50 ETH from UNICEF Innovation and 80 ETH from 15,500 Donors)!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, a less tangible highlight is how the PGF team has become a tight and highly efficient unit. It wasn’t easy to reorg the team but we’re down a total of 50% of contributors over the past 3 seasons to 9 FT and 2 PT contributors and one contributor on leave (<a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/annika">@annika</a> we’re excited to have you back soon). We’re building a strong culture of talented, highly effective, and dedicated contributors.</p>
<p>Our main goals for S17 are twofold:<br>
<strong>Protocol growth readiness and Gitcoin Grants Program readiness.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our overarching priority in S17 is to continue setting up the protocol for successful adoption with solid infrastructure to drive sustainable growth.</strong></p>
<p>Overall we will</p>
<ol>
<li>Developing runbooks and guides for communities to use to run QF rounds and drive adoption</li>
<li>Running test rounds with partners to onboard and enable them to manage their own programs permissionlessly</li>
<li>Defining and launching the Core Gitcoin Grants Program in April, to embrace our DAO’s goal of funding public goods with our protocol</li>
<li>Defining and providing a paid services offering to early adopters until a fully self serve approach is viable</li>
</ol>
<h1><a name="amount-4" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#amount-4"></a>Amount</h1>
<p>PGF’s total request will be <strong>$606,000 USD</strong> for S17. A 30% decrease from last season. Accounting for 60+ day reserves and current reserves we are requesting <strong>$337,903 USD</strong> for S17. A 68% decrease from last season.</p>
<p><em><strong>1)</strong> The amount of GTC requested and the value of the reserves will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally using the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average, whichever is lower.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>2)</strong> The Treasury Request amount is an estimate using the price of $2.10 GTC to calculate the total of the reserves rolled over from Season 16.</em></p>
