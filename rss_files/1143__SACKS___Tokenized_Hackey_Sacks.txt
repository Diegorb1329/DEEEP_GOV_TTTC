https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/sacks-tokenized-hackey-sacks/3231
    Hey all,

@austingriffith and I are running the public goods funding experiments workstream ( https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-suggestion-public-goods-prototyping/130/1 ), and I am happy to say that I've now frontrun the workstream by launching a new public goods funding experiment. 

$SACKS is a tokenized hackey sack branded with the Quadratic Lands logo on it, there will only be 250 of them. 

Hackers love hackey sacks!  They are a great colorado-native way of meeting others at HACKathons. :thinking: 

![E2a0dB3VIAIldBh|690x473, 75%](upload://hUcSonn4eokeYFWWCY6hZhPYKDH.jpeg)

To get one, go to uniswap v3 + get $SACKS from 0xa6610Ed604047e7B76C1DA288172D15BcdA57596  (all proceeds go to the Gitcoin Grants matching pool)

If you have a $SACKS token, to get a hackey sack:

1. burn it to 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead
2. fill out this form https://forms.gle/M2Cwc9VkhpfmLTs49
3. success!

The [SACKS LP](https://app.uniswap.org/#/pool/25670) position has been transfered to the [@gitcoin](https://twitter.com/gitcoin) community multisig, where it can be subject to GitcoinDAO governance.

I hope that you all have fun with this experiment.  Whats fun about it is that no coding skills were required at all.  I hope that inspires future members of the public goods funding workstream https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-suggestion-public-goods-prototyping/130/1 to experiment more in public goods funding!
