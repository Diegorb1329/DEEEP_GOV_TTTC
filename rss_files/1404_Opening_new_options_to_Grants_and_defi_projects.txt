    We all have an idea of the real value of different crypto currencies. Not only more people getting into the crypto environment, most of them start to notice the blockchain technology.

Growing every single day, DAOs, blockchain, and Bitcoin are here to stay. With that being said nowadays, loans on crypto to trade are easiest and quicker than never. 
Being able to ask for a loan and locking the payment of that loan on the same block allowing the borrower to have a guarantee of the loan being paid back.

I can deploy a smart contract where automatically allow the developers of the grant allocate the loan  to wherever they need the most.

Obviously  I am looking for a developer where we can work together, to make this a reality and bring more attention, and people to the new era.

If you are interested, do not hesitate to reach me, if you think you can improve it, please do not hesitate to get back to me.

The revolution has begun.
