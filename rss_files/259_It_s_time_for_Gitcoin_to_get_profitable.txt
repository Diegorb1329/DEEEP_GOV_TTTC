# üå± Funding What Matters: Profitability & the Infinite Game  

Hey Gitcoiners,  

Gitcoin exists to **fund what matters**‚Äîto allocate resources to the builders, public goods, and regenerative projects that push the space forward. But to fulfill this mission **at scale and over time, Gitcoin itself must be financially sustainable.**  

**Profitability isn‚Äôt just a financial goal‚Äîit‚Äôs an enabler of impact.** If we want to keep funding what matters indefinitely, we need a model that ensures Gitcoin generates more value than it spends.  

### üî• What is Profitability?  
At its core, profitability means **Gitcoin has a sustainable financial engine.** Our revenue streams (from protocol usage, grants programs, partnerships, etc.) must exceed our operational costs. More importantly, profitability means **we don‚Äôt just survive‚Äîwe thrive.**  

**A sustainable Gitcoin means:**  
‚úÖ More funds for builders, open-source maintainers, and impact projects.  
‚úÖ Less reliance on outside grants or treasury drawdowns.  
‚úÖ The ability to fund public goods **not just today, but 10+ years from now.**  

### üéØ Why Does Profitability Matter for Gitcoin?  
1. **Mission Alignment:** Our goal isn‚Äôt just to sustain Gitcoin‚Äîit‚Äôs to sustain the builders and communities we serve. Profitability lets us **fund what matters indefinitely.**  
2. **Infinite Game Thinking:** A financially sustainable Gitcoin **isn‚Äôt just reactive‚Äîit‚Äôs proactive.** We can build, iterate, and refine our mechanisms over the long haul.  
3. **Regenerative Economics:** A thriving Gitcoin means **more value flows back into the ecosystem,** instead of being extracted or depleted.  

### üèó Profitability Across Gitcoin‚Äôs Core Products  

Gitcoin‚Äôs economic engine is powered by three main components:  

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Allo.Capital**  
**Monetization Model: Protocol Fees, Revenue, Fund**  

Allo Protocol is the backbone of Gitcoin‚Äôs grants infrastructure. Profitability here means ensuring **sustainable revenue streams from protocol usage, integrations, and ecosystem adoption.**  

Allo Kit - is an enabler of other builders to build apps that fund what matters.  There may be service revenue or app level fees that come out of it. 

Allo Fund - it is a possible business unit we launch that allows us to participate in upside of the apps launched in/around Gitcoin/Allo.  


#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Gitcoin Grants (GG) Program**  
**Monetization Model: Fee Revenue**  
The GG Program funds public goods using Gitcoin‚Äôs infrastructure. To be financially sustainable, we need to design models where **the people administering these rounds can charge a fee to keep themselves afloat financially** and where **ecosystem partners contribute, funding is diversified, and long-term stability is prioritized.**  

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Grants Lab**  
**Monetization Model: Attestations, Services Revenue, Retroactive Funding**  
Grants Lab is the primary software development unit of Gitcoin, empowering its ecosystem with new funding models and mechanisms. 

It has a diversified revenue stream that includes mint attestations, services revenue, and retroactive funding.  [More on their annual budget request.](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/2025-proposal-budget-grants-labs/19844)

### üöÄ The Path Forward  

Zooming out - Gitcoin's mission **funding what matters.** But if we don‚Äôt ensure our own financial sustainability, we won‚Äôt be around to fulfill that mission long-term.  

Our next chapter must be about **building a regenerative, impact-driven, and financially sound Gitcoin.** When we‚Äôre profitable, we **fund more builders, allocate more resources, and expand the frontier of what‚Äôs possible.**
  
**Here's the brass tax:** Gitcoin can become profitable.  It's already doing more than $1m/year in revenue.  But it's costs are too high for that level of revenue (closer to $4.5m/yr) It can either become profitable by cutting costs or growing revenue.  2025 is the year where we give growing revenue a shot.  If that doesnt work, then 2026 will be a very tough year.


Let‚Äôs **fund what matters‚Äîforever.**

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a>  Gm gm !! hope all is well. Just a quick question, If I have a bright idea for a possible collab with Gitcoin and a project that I am building ( a profit sharing idea with Gitcoin ). Where can I propose that ? Perhaps a general discussion regarding eligibility or vibe check on office hour chat before I can bring it to public discussion. Some guidance would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>We are pulling GL burn down to ~250k/mo after completing contracts in March, as noted in the deck. I think we have <em>some</em> more room to cut but anything material (more than 10-15k/mo) will start impacting our ability to deliver roadmap/serve customers. We are full steam ahead on revenue with 260k YTD and hoping to hit 450-500k in Q1. We are also rolling out a GTC experiment in GG23 as noted above.</p>

<p>Happy to learn more about what Marc of AAVE did‚Ä¶ got a TLDR?</p>
<p>FYI Gitcoin‚Äôs spend has been cut by 2/3 (from $1.2m/mo a couple years ago down to about ~$400k/mo right now).  I‚Äôd defer to GL lead <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/meglister">@meglister</a> as to whether any more spend optimizations are feasible/necessary.  Whats the most feasible way to get profitable?  (1) Cut costs or (2) keep costs constant and accelerate into increased revenue?   It seems that the path were on now is primarily the latter.</p>

            <p>Love to see it!</p>
<p>Especially love the idea that ‚ÄúOur revenue streams must <strong>exceed</strong> our operational costs.‚Äù, not just be net zero.</p>
<p>My main criticism is that the post doesn‚Äòt even mention $GTC, which is imo an important part of the picture for these reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aligning the Gitcoin ecosystem</li>
<li>Making Gitcoin less prone to governance attacks</li>
<li>Raising morale by making long term believers whole</li>
<li>Increases of treasury, free marketing &amp; other things that come with having a token with good price action</li>
</ul>
<p>More thoughts outlined in the <a href="http://gov.gitcoin.co/t/regenerating-gtc/19792/">Regenerating $GTC</a> post</p>
<p>I think it would also be worth looking into how Gitcoin is spending those $4.5m/yr &amp; try to get that lower instead of just increasing the $1m/yr of revenue. Seems like a lot for whats happening tbh.</p>
<p>As has been general practice and demonstrated by Marc of Aave as well, first comes cost-cutting, then revenue growth. Maybe they can be done concurrently, but the high spend def shouldn‚Äòt just fly under the radar.</p>
<p>Tl;dr I love the post, but also have decently sized concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>No mention of GTC</li>
<li>Glazing over current burn rate</li>

            <p>Allo.fund is an interesting idea to both make Gitcoin profitable &amp; take worthy startups to the next level.</p>
<p>Is the concept to invest in projects in the allocation space from an existing treasury or raise from LPs? If the LPs are the way, there‚Äôs more than 1,000 family offices in this sheet which could potentially support that: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MDmiW4MpWnmfbmOpjJeOJMTf-BiKN3GLRV3eLJ8KUqM/edit?usp=sharing" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Fund Your Purpose - Google Sheets</a></p>
<p>The track record ratio of grants allocated by Gitcoin to their resulting market cap is phenomenal overall, if investments went into the top grantees which also fit the thesis it would be even better.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll be honest, this is also a selfish question. I‚Äôve consistently kept 1/3 of my salary in GTC, because I believed and believe in Gitcoin‚Äôs future. This was at a time that the token value was between 6 and $20.</p>
<p>A way to increase the runway is also focusing enough on the value increase of GTC, is this no longer a point of focus?</p>

The GG Program funds public goods using Gitcoin‚Äôs infrastructure. To be financially sustainable, we need to design models where <strong>the people administering these rounds can charge a fee to keep themselves afloat financially</strong> and where <strong>ecosystem partners contribute, funding is diversified, and long-term stability is prioritized.</strong></p>

<p>Zooming out - Gitcoin‚Äôs mission <strong>funding what matters.</strong> But if we don‚Äôt ensure our own financial sustainability, we won‚Äôt be around to fulfill that mission long-term.</p>
<p>Our next chapter must be about <strong>building a regenerative, impact-driven, and financially sound Gitcoin.</strong> When we‚Äôre profitable, we <strong>fund more builders, allocate more resources, and expand the frontier of what‚Äôs possible.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Here‚Äôs the brass tax:</strong> Gitcoin can become profitable.  It‚Äôs already doing more than $1m/year in revenue.  But it‚Äôs costs are too high for that level of revenue (closer to $4.5m/yr) It can either become profitable by cutting costs or growing revenue.  2025 is the year where we give growing revenue a shot.  If that doesnt work, then 2026 will be a very tough year.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs <strong>fund what matters‚Äîforever.</strong></p>
