Ecosystem Collective S21/22 Budget Proposal
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/ecosystem-collective-s21-22-budget-proposal/18240
    This proposal is seeking a total of $1,801,672 of funding for the Ecosystem Collective‚Äôs 360 Team & the work they will complete for the latter half of S21 and for the total of S22 (March 1 - July 31, 2024). 


### TL;DR

With the recent [reorganization of Gitcoin into several business units](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-entering-the-end-game/17560) and a community-focused subDAO, Gitcoin [introduced a new unit: the Ecosystem Collective](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-gitcoin-s-ecosystem-collective/17954). This unit is dedicated to stewarding Gitcoin‚Äôs brand, community and governance in support of the overall growth and health of the Gitcoin ecosystem.

This budget request for S21/22 is $1,283,935 including reserves and roll-over amounts. Total anticipated spend in S21/22 is $1,356,379. Details of this budget request are listed below.


### Focus Areas, Objectives & Results:

In 2024, EC will focus on 3 key areas in 2024:



* **Focus Area 1 - People:** Deepen engagement and grow participation in Gitcoin‚Äôs community(ies)
* **Focus Area 2 - Innovation:** Experiment with Gitcoin products and build prototypes to advance our mission
* **Focus Area 3 - Impact:**  Forward Gitcoin as a powerful impact-driven brand

EC will use the OKR framework to ensure that all of the work is aligned with each pillar and DAO‚Äôs strategic goals.

   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


_* This isn't an actual Key Result; the EC will first develop a strategy and plan by end of S21 and then set new KR(s) for S22 based on the plan._


### Specific functions of the Unit:



* Strategy & Ops (OKR setting, project management, etc.)
* Governance (Gitcoin Grants, DAO governance, etc.) 
* Community Engagement (communities of practice, Citizen Grants, Gitcoin Grants, etc)
* Events
* Design
* Brand & Comms (media relations, partnerships, impact reporting, etc.)
* Research
* Rapid Prototyping

We will also map seasonal budget reporting to these functions in order to create clarity on how much we are spending on each function. Please comment if you would like to see any other functions reported on.


## Budget Request


### Team structure

The EC will employ a team of always-on contributors called the ‚Äú360 Team‚Äù. They will ensure the integrity and execution of key always-on initiatives. 

Having an established team will enable more seamless context sharing to Gitcoin Citizens and create strategic alignment for bottom-up initiatives. 

The initiatives that will be directly steered by the 360 Team are those that touch strategic decision-making, brand/comms management and other high-context or always-on functions.

Ecosystem Collective S21/22 Budget Proposal
gaoa97

            <p>This is a well-structured, informative proposal, and I‚Äôm supportive of the holonic approach optimizing for long-term impact in the Ecosystem Collective (EC), particularly highlighting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear Focus Areas and Objectives: The breakdown into ‚ÄúPeople,‚Äù ‚ÄúInnovation,‚Äù and ‚ÄúImpact‚Äù provides a clear direction for the EC‚Äôs work and aligns with Gitcoin‚Äôs Essential Intents.</li>
<li>Measurable Key Results (KRs): The use of the OKR framework with specific KRs for each objective demonstrates a data-driven approach to measuring success.</li>
<li>Transparency in Budget Allocation: Mapping the budget to specific functions like ‚ÄúCommunity Engagement‚Äù and ‚ÄúBrand &amp; Comms‚Äù allows for clear understanding of resource allocation.</li>

            <p>An update for everyone on this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total leftover funds in the MMM multisig is $517,737</li>
<li>This amount will be carried over into the EC multisig, and is therefore being deducted from the total request amount</li>
<li>This amount includes leftover funds from the <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-budget-request-for-ethdenver-activation/17424">EthDenver activation</a> that were not spent - instead of returning this to the Gitcoin Treasury, these have been deducted from the total request</li>

            <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/meglister">@meglister</a>, appreciate you sharing your concerns. You can count on us to thoroughly report on spend and have a much more scoped roadmap in future requests. The window of time we had to generate this request while spinning up a net new unit of the DAO with a fully fleshed strategy was very ambitious <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/melting_face.png?v=12" title=":melting_face:" class="emoji" alt=":melting_face:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>Not my favourite way to approach the work but we had to get something out to ensure we could meet the march deadline for contributor payouts this month. Really excited to continue to build momentum both with EC strategy and ops <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/sparkling_heart.png?v=12" title=":sparkling_heart:" class="emoji" alt=":sparkling_heart:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p>Excited for this new direction and grateful for the work of the ecosystem collective team! I will vote in support of this proposal.</p>
<p>One note on budget that I mentioned to <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/viriya">@Viriya</a> : I‚Äôm a little skittish about having ~40% of the budget in two catch-all buckets, ‚Äúconsultants‚Äù and ‚Äúrfps.‚Äù I trust this group to manage expenses well and understand that this is the first pass and will likely grow more detailed in future rounds. Just pointing out that we likely shouldn‚Äôt make a habit of this!</p>

            <p>I am excited to see this reset + the subsequent evolution of the DAO after it.</p>
<p>Some comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think that this proposal is likely just the start of something fairly simple and that we will want to grow more complexity over time.</li>
<li>I am particularly excited about pod-based working structures (as opposed to workstreams - which I believe became too bloated, political, and hierarchical over time), and the ability to the ECS to collaborate with Citizens.</li>
<li>If we can cultivate the Citizens engagement and stimulate an upward spiral of more trust + collaborative working relationships, I think that will be important.  Right now I think Gitcoin is 9/10 as a social DAO and 4/10 as a software development shop (or network of software development shops), and I think that engaging technical people in the Citizens is key to turning that around.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said - I will be abstaining from voting on this proposal due to conflicts of interest (I am a contributor in the ECC).</p>

<p>The EC will employ a team of always-on contributors called the ‚Äú360 Team‚Äù. They will ensure the integrity and execution of key always-on initiatives.</p>
<p>Having an established team will enable more seamless context sharing to Gitcoin Citizens and create strategic alignment for bottom-up initiatives.</p>
<p>The initiatives that will be directly steered by the 360 Team are those that touch strategic decision-making, brand/comms management and other high-context or always-on functions.</p>
