https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-passport-s21-business-unit-budget-proposal/17634
    <h1>Gitcoin Passport S21 Business Unit Budget Proposal  </h1>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>


Gitcoin Passport aims to be the go-to solution for web3 identity management. In Seasons 20 and 21, we’ll concentrate on five key pillars:



1. **Effectiveness:** Improve identity scoring models 
2. **Adoption:** Grow to 1.5M passports
3. **GTC Utility**: Strengthen GTC-based identity and community ties
4. **Data:** Enhance and aggregate Sybil detection and data sets
5. **Partnerships:** Increase both API and onchain partnerships

The budget for S21 (Feb 1st - April 30th) was [previously approved](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-passport-season-20-21-budget-request/16765) and we’ll be moving funds with a Tally vote for $481,215 as the completion of that budget.

**Given the announced changes to the organization, we do have two new roles we are hiring for (Product Marketing and Operations). Our budget request is slightly higher in S21, but we are under budget for S20. Details are outlined below in the Funding Request section.**

<h2>Milestone Update: Season 20</h2>


Season 20 Update for S21 Budget

In Season 20, our top line growth picked up a bit, but was slower than we had anticipated going into the end of last year. We have a total of 900k unique all time passports. We also continued to drive strongly against our targets in GTC staking, hitting over 1.3M GTC staked.

We’ve also expanded our potential service offerings beyond the standard Passport & onchain Passports to include the new Ethereum Stamp backed a new Eth activity model. This is proving to be highly effective at classifying Sybils. It can also be used to score addresses without requiring any user interaction.

**Observations:**

* While we fell short on passport adoption, we found success in GTC staking, continuing the path for utility. The upcoming revamp of identity staking, from smart contracts to UI, should continue to grow the utility of GTC.
* In S20 we started to gain adoption from the partner side of onchain Passports with a new set of partners to onboard within the next season. Despite lacking full utility, onchain Passports continues to gain traction.

By revisiting our milestones and assessing both successes and shortcomings, we're armed with invaluable insights for strategizing in the upcoming seasons. For more granular details on our past work and future plans, please refer to our previous budgets for [S17](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s17-proposal-integrated-gitcoin-passport-budget-request/12727) and [S18 & S19 budget request,](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gitcoin-passport-workstream-season-18-19-budget-request/14121) as well as the [S19 Amended Budget Request](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s19-proposal-amended-passport-s19-budget-request/16184) and [Passport Roadmap](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15745RJWTkpurLIOOEuIeZp3Y249HBhGs4fIuj2LjQ8Q/edit#gid=0).

<h2>Budget Update: Season S21 </h2>


We are maintaining a flat budget for S21, but incorporating previous costs and additional headcount that were previously allocated to the MMM workstream. The additional budget includes hiring a Sr. Product Marketing Manager, moving from part time to full time Operations, and adding consulting budget for GTM support.

**Team Composition**

**Full-Time Contributors:** 10



* Developers: 4
* Product Manager: 1
* Data Scientists: 2
* Workstream Lead: 1
* Operations: 1
* Marketing: 1
* Support: 2 (previously shared cost with Grants Labs, moving to fully dedicated to Passport)

**Part-Time or Shared Contributors: 5**



* Design: 1
* DevRel: 2
* DevOps: 2

<h2>Funding Request for Seasons S20 & S21</h2>


**Requested Amount:** Gitcoin Passport is requesting an allocation of ~422,118 GTC**, equivalent to approximately $481,215 to cover S21. This includes reserve and rollover funds.

            <p>One item to note, given the increase in the budget compared to the original request (for good reason given the changes in org design), I would suggest we go to Snapshot to ratify the change. I would hate to set a precedent that budget increases don’t need to go to a vote.</p>
<p>Given the 5 days on the forums and 5 comments from stewards, I moved this to Snapshot for a vote:<br>

Gitcoin Passport S21 Business Unit Budget Proposal
Viriya

            <p>I’m supportive of this budget.</p>
<p>Both as a steward and someone who has worked more closely on Passport in the last couple of months, I’m really interested to see what happens with the team’s quest for PMF. There are a lot of promising markets and bets to make. I think if we follow the right paths, Passport could seize the <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/passport-is-our-aws/10995">billion dollar opportunity</a> that is potentially available to it.</p>

            <p>Thanks Jeremy for posting. It looks like a mostly flat request, with a request for additional funds for marketing support (which makes sense to me given <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/announcing-the-spin-down-of-mmm/17643">MMM spin down</a>). I would support this given the results Passport is continuing to drive.</p>

<p><strong>Observations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While we fell short on passport adoption, we found success in GTC staking, continuing the path for utility. The upcoming revamp of identity staking, from smart contracts to UI, should continue to grow the utility of GTC.</li>
<li>In S20 we started to gain adoption from the partner side of onchain Passports with a new set of partners to onboard within the next season. Despite lacking full utility, onchain Passports continues to gain traction.</li>
</ul>
<p>By revisiting our milestones and assessing both successes and shortcomings, we’re armed with invaluable insights for strategizing in the upcoming seasons. For more granular details on our past work and future plans, please refer to our previous budgets for <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s17-proposal-integrated-gitcoin-passport-budget-request/12727">S17</a> and <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gitcoin-passport-workstream-season-18-19-budget-request/14121">S18 &amp; S19 budget request,</a> as well as the <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s19-proposal-amended-passport-s19-budget-request/16184">S19 Amended Budget Request</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15745RJWTkpurLIOOEuIeZp3Y249HBhGs4fIuj2LjQ8Q/edit#gid=0" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Passport Roadmap</a>.</p>
