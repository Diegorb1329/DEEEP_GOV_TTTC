https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/dao-financial-report-may-2024/18987
    **Summary**

In the past month, operational expenses amounted to $633,758, marking a decrease of $109,585 compared to the previous month. This decrease underscores our steadfast dedication to financial prudence.

As of May 2024, the current value of the DAO treasury is $67,109,851, reflecting an upsurge from the previous period. This increase is chiefly due to the rise in the price of the GTC token, which has surged by 39.56% since the last report.

This report provides a thorough examination of our financial performance throughout May 2024, highlighting essential metrics and budgetary analysis.

## [Overview](https://dune.com/umarkhaneth/gitcoin-treasury)

* **Last Month's Treasury Holdings**: $49,251,125
* **Current Month Treasury Holdings**: $67,109,851
* **Variance** ($17,858,726, 36.26%): Mainly influenced by the fluctuating price of the token, which saw an upturn last month, and compounded by the effect of our monthly operating expenses across all workstreams, amounting to $633,758.

## Runway

The surge in the value of our treasury's GTC holdings, largely influenced by GTC's performance, has affected our Runway. At present, our Runway is projected to be 96 months (8 years), considering an estimated expenditure of $700,000 across the Business Units and the Ecosystem Collective.

The total GTC held within the DAO stands at $57,295,244, with each token averaging a value of $1.77.

Currently, our reliance on GTC is at 85.38%, underscoring the substantial impact of this token's performance on our treasury. To mitigate associated risks and ensure financial resilience amid market fluctuations, it is crucial to diligently monitor and explore strategies for diversifying our treasury holdings.

Last Month's Expenditure: Our spending for the prior month amounted to $633,758, showcasing a praiseworthy decrease of 14.74% (equivalent to $109,585) from our expenditure of $743,343 the month before. This disciplined adherence to the budget highlights our unwavering dedication to efficient resource allocation.
