## Bear Cycles Don't Last Forever :bear:

However, the severity of recent events in crypto has some of us asking ourselves, [“What is Web3 for?”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro9kFPX0Tk0), and [“Is Web3 good for the world?”](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1592288733696790528).

Our answer? [The FTX debacle](https://twitter.com/AutismCapital/status/1592984494814171137?s=20&t=EV7N-hg2DtPaimW5h7W20Q) just further illustrates how much decentralization, transparency, and antifragility truly matter.

According to the Ethereum Foundation, these values are always [what was intended for Web3](https://ethereum.org/en/web3/).

While the events surrounding FTX and Alameda Research have had negative effects for most everyone involved in crypto and Web3, perhaps this needed to happen for crypto to flush out bad actors, and return to its original values.

**Case in point: for Web3 to continue to exist,** [**the future must be decentralized**](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/allocationism-towards-a-holistic-purpose-vision-strategy/11948).

## ☑️ From the Governance Forum

*These are the top three posts from this week in the Gitcoin Governance forum.* [*See the latest here*](https://gov.gitcoin.co/latest).

* [**# OpenData Community Hackathon Results**](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/opendata-community-hackathon-results/11943) **by** [**epowell101**
](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/epowell101)
The OpenData Community is an [independent DAO](https://twitter.com/OpenDataforWeb3) started by GitCoin– and more specifically, by the FDD workstream. The first Open Data Science Hackathon ran in October, and effectively launched the DAO. In this post, Evan gives the results of the hackathon! Congratulations to hackers [ataraxiae](https://dune.com/ataraxiae/gitcoin-gr15), [jennifertran](https://dune.com/jennifertran/gitcoin-gr15-analysis), [the Slay Sibil team](https://github.com/0x9simon/slaysybil), and [the poupou-web3 team](https://github.com/poupou-web3/GC-ODS-Sybil)! The results were voted on using Quadratic Voting.

  The ODS community welcomes data scientists, a community builders, degens, project developers, and who who wants to use web3 data to build on the decentralization ethos of Ethereum. [**Join us in the Discord!**](https://t.co/ecF9ywK8X3)

* [**Allocationism: Towards a Holistic Purpose, Vision, & Strategy**](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/allocationism-towards-a-holistic-purpose-vision-strategy/11948) **by** [**DisruptionJoe**
](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/DisruptionJoe)
Joe puts forth the concept of Allocationism, which is the name he gives to the new “power distribution substrate” we are building at Gitcoin. In a nutshell, Allocationism provides a means to coordinate more effectively and make real-world political impact using the protocols, community, and culture we are building at Gitcoin. Joe challenges the DAO to dream bigger in the post, saying that we need to create a stronger purpose statement, and a stronger vision and better strategic clarity in the DAO. Joe offers that uniting the DAO around Allocationism is potentially a much stronger and more galvanizing purpose than “funding our shared needs”.

  [**This post was offered by Joe to spark discussion. Add your feedback in the replies!**
](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/allocationism-towards-a-holistic-purpose-vision-strategy/11948)
* [**Decentralized social graph as an oracle powered by the wisdom of the crowd for the era of Plurality**](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/decentralized-social-graph-as-an-oracle-powered-by-the-wisdom-of-the-crowd-for-the-era-of-plurality/11927) **by** [**tkgshn**
](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/tkgshn)
**tkgshn** offers some thinking behind *DeCartography*, which is a protocol that outputs data from the Plurality social graph as an oracle. tkgshn asserts that DeCartography is an effective sybil defense tool to prevent collusion. This ideology is based on the concept of “[Plurality](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/why-i-am-a-pluralist/)”, and the author offers that DeCartography might better be called, “Plurality Quadratic Funding”. You can [read a draft of the whitepaper here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i4rPj1qlvV9RhfP9jwaI_ESEMZ-7tvBLbftDdOmEWWk/edit#), and you can [add your feedback in the comments](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/decentralized-social-graph-as-an-oracle-powered-by-the-wisdom-of-the-crowd-for-the-era-of-plurality/11927).

### 🎙Latest Episodes from Green Pill

* [**Ethereum is Punk | Green Pill #62**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gRtQOPyABg) – This is the third and final episode in a three-part series about the concept of Punk. What is it, and what kind of punk best maps to Ethereum as an ecosystem? In this episode, we show a talk that Kevin gave at [Devcon Bogota in 2022](https://devcon.org/default/), which walks through Cypherpunk, [Solarpunk, Lunarpunk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKn7KOMg7A&t=1s)(part one of series), and [Terrapunk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VW48dClSYw)(part two). Ultimately, Ethereum is the punk that we make of it.

* [**Is Crypto Good for the World? with David Hoffman & Juan Benet | Green Pill #63**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro9kFPX0Tk0) – After one of the toughest weeks in crypto history, many are left wondering, “is crypto even good for the world?”. Kevin brings on [Bankless](https://twitter.com/BanklessHQ) Co-Founder, [David Hoffman](https://twitter.com/TrustlessState) and CEO of [Protocol Labs](https://twitter.com/protocollabs), [Juan Benet](https://twitter.com/juanbenet) to answer that question. In addition, the three chat about how markets have a memories, the difference between squad and individual wealth, and how to make the next FTX meltdown preventable.

  <p>熊市周期不会永远持续下去然而，最近加密事件的严重性让我们中的一些人问自己，“Web3 有什么用？”&nbsp;，以及“Web3 对世界有益吗？”&nbsp;.我们的答案？FTX 的崩溃进一步说明了去中心化、透明度和反脆弱性的真正重要性。根据以太坊基金会的说法，这些值始终是 Web3 的预期值。虽然围绕 FTX 和 Alameda Research 的事件对大多数参与加密货币和 Web3 的人都产生了负面影响，但也许这需要发生才能让加密货币清除不良行为者并恢复其原始价值。举个例子：Web3...</p>

<p>However, the severity of recent events in crypto has some of us asking ourselves, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro9kFPX0Tk0" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">“What is Web3 for?”</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1592288733696790528" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">“Is Web3 good for the world?”</a>.</p>
<p>Our answer? <a href="https://twitter.com/AutismCapital/status/1592984494814171137?s=20&amp;t=EV7N-hg2DtPaimW5h7W20Q" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">The FTX debacle</a> just further illustrates how much decentralization, transparency, and antifragility truly matter.</p>
<p>According to the Ethereum Foundation, these values are always <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/web3/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">what was intended for Web3</a>.</p>
<p>While the events surrounding FTX and Alameda Research have had negative effects for most everyone involved in crypto and Web3, perhaps this needed to happen for crypto to flush out bad actors, and return to its original values.</p>
<p><strong>Case in point: for Web3 to continue to exist,</strong> <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/allocationism-towards-a-holistic-purpose-vision-strategy/11948"><strong>the future must be decentralized</strong></a>.</p>

</a><br>
The OpenData Community is an <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenDataforWeb3" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">independent DAO</a> started by GitCoin– and more specifically, by the FDD workstream. The first Open Data Science Hackathon ran in October, and effectively launched the DAO. In this post, Evan gives the results of the hackathon! Congratulations to hackers <a href="https://dune.com/ataraxiae/gitcoin-gr15" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">ataraxiae</a>, <a href="https://dune.com/jennifertran/gitcoin-gr15-analysis" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">jennifertran</a>, <a href="https://github.com/0x9simon/slaysybil" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">the Slay Sibil team</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/poupou-web3/GC-ODS-Sybil" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">the poupou-web3 team</a>! The results were voted on using Quadratic Voting.</p>
<p>The ODS community welcomes data scientists, a community builders, degens, project developers, and who who wants to use web3 data to build on the decentralization ethos of Ethereum. <a href="https://t.co/ecF9ywK8X3" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><strong>Join us in the Discord!</strong></a></p>

<p><a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/allocationism-towards-a-holistic-purpose-vision-strategy/11948"><strong>Allocationism: Towards a Holistic Purpose, Vision, &amp; Strategy</strong></a> <strong>by</strong> <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/DisruptionJoe"><strong>DisruptionJoe</strong><br>
</a><br>
Joe puts forth the concept of Allocationism, which is the name he gives to the new “power distribution substrate” we are building at Gitcoin. In a nutshell, Allocationism provides a means to coordinate more effectively and make real-world political impact using the protocols, community, and culture we are building at Gitcoin. Joe challenges the DAO to dream bigger in the post, saying that we need to create a stronger purpose statement, and a stronger vision and better strategic clarity in the DAO. Joe offers that uniting the DAO around Allocationism is potentially a much stronger and more galvanizing purpose than “funding our shared needs”.</p>

</a><br>
<strong>tkgshn</strong> offers some thinking behind <em>DeCartography</em>, which is a protocol that outputs data from the Plurality social graph as an oracle. tkgshn asserts that DeCartography is an effective sybil defense tool to prevent collusion. This ideology is based on the concept of “<a href="https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/why-i-am-a-pluralist/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Plurality</a>”, and the author offers that DeCartography might better be called, “Plurality Quadratic Funding”.
