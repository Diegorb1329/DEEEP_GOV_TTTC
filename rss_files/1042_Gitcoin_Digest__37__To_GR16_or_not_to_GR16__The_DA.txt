### To GR16 or not to GR16? 👀
---

This week, GitcoinDAO leads contributors pondered the merits of whether to have a Grants Round in December, and how that grants round might be modified, to meet both the needs of grantees and Ethereum-based ecosystems, as well as the needs of the DAO in launching dGrants.

**High-level, here’s what’s happening in the DAO this week:**

* **Read:** Janine posted a proposal on whether to run GR16 in December, so that DAO workstreams might focus their attention on shipping dGrants protocols in the Spring of 2023(Passport, Round Manager, Grants Hub). [The proposal is open for comment](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/request-for-feedback-proposed-future-for-the-grant-programs-and-gr16-as-we-transition-to-the-protocol/11624/7). Please read it and [leave your feedback!](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/request-for-feedback-proposed-future-for-the-grant-programs-and-gr16-as-we-transition-to-the-protocol/11624/7)

* **Schelling Point happened this week, last Monday.** This was our [biggest Schelling Point yet](https://twitter.com/Sim_Pop/status/1576912633730863104?s=20&t=ZTf0G-6FQH0yJmWHYGCjGA).

## ☑️ From the Governance Forum

*We had an active week in the Governance Forum, to put it lightly. Lots to read and comment on this week!*

* [**[Request for feedback] Proposed Future for the Grant Programs and GR16 as we Transition to the Protocol**](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/request-for-feedback-proposed-future-for-the-grant-programs-and-gr16-as-we-transition-to-the-protocol/11624/7), **by** [**Janine**
](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/J9leger)
This proposal was co-authored by Janine, [Connor](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/connor), [lthrift](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/lthrift), [nategosselin](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/nategosselin), [ceresstation](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation), [kevin.olsen](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kevin.olsen), and [Laura | Viriya](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/viriya), with feedback from other DAO contributors. In the proposal, Janine proposes that GitcoinDAO should consider running a modified, smaller Grants Round for GR16 in December, or perhaps not running a Grants Round at all, so that Gitcoin workstreams can focus their attention towards shipping the new grants protocols(Passport, Grants Hub, Round Manager). There is a lively discussion happening in the comments. Whether to host a GR16 in December and in what manner is a big decision, and will have an impact not only on the Gitcoin brand and ecosystem, but on the greater Ethereum ecosystem as well. In the spirit of the DAO’s values of transparency and open source ethos, we encourage you to read the post and comments, and add your own feedback there.

  **Request for Comment:** [Add your comments to the thread here.

* [**Proposal: V2 of the Steward Council**](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-v2-of-the-steward-council/11639/1), **by** [**shawn16400**
](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/shawn16400)
In this proposal, shawn16400 gives concrete ways to evolve and improve the existing Steward Council. Shawn16400 proposes improvements in the following three areas: Updating objectives and role of the Steward Council, Steward council remuneration, and changing the selection process for steward council members.

  **Request for Comment:** [Add your comments to the thread here.](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-v2-of-the-steward-council/11639/1)

* [**“[Proposal] Ratify the Results of Grants Round 15…”, by Janine**
](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-ratify-the-results-of-grants-round-15-and-formally-request-the-community-multisig-holders-to-payout-matching-allocations/11593)
This thread was originally posted on 9/30. Since then, [a Snapshot proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0x41c47d0531dc252c1ae2e4caf256fa7c5f0c09bd71f4c02f543b111d3cf788ab) was created and passed with 100% for the proposal. Numerous comments have been added from GitcoinDAO workstream leads and stewards voicing their support for the proposal. Some commenters [posted clarifying questions](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-ratify-the-results-of-grants-round-15-and-formally-request-the-community-multisig-holders-to-payout-matching-allocations/11593/12?u=alexdwagner) as well. If you were a GR15 grantee, the post is worth reviewing to better understand the payment process for matching funds, and the status of payments. TL;DR: The GR15 round results have been ratified and matching fund payments will be going out to grantees in the next two weeks.

### 📰 From the Gitcoin Blog This Week

* [**Introduction to Grants Protocol**](https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/introduction-to-grants-protocol), **by** [**Julia Pepper**
](https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/author/julia-pepper)
This post gives a short history of Gitcoin Grants, and outlines its “protocol future”. TL;DR: by creating decentralized, open source protocols we can empower communities in the Ethereum ecosystem to independently run their own grants rounds, to create a more resilient, interdependent, and thriving web3 ecosystem for us all. Creating open grants protocols is a natural progression of GitcoinDAO’s commitment to building and funding digital public goods for all.

</a><br>
This proposal was co-authored by Janine, <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/connor">Connor</a>, <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/lthrift">lthrift</a>, <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/nategosselin">nategosselin</a>, <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation">ceresstation</a>, <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kevin.olsen">kevin.olsen</a>, and <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/viriya">Laura | Viriya</a>, with feedback from other DAO contributors. In the proposal, Janine proposes that GitcoinDAO should consider running a modified, smaller Grants Round for GR16 in December, or perhaps not running a Grants Round at all, so that Gitcoin workstreams can focus their attention towards shipping the new grants protocols(Passport, Grants Hub, Round Manager). There is a lively discussion happening in the comments. Whether to host a GR16 in December and in what manner is a big decision, and will have an impact not only on the Gitcoin brand and ecosystem, but on the greater Ethereum ecosystem as well. In the spirit of the DAO’s values of transparency and open source ethos, we encourage you to read the post and comments, and add your own feedback there.</p>

</a><br>
In this proposal, shawn16400 gives concrete ways to evolve and improve the existing Steward Council. Shawn16400 proposes improvements in the following three areas: Updating objectives and role of the Steward Council, Steward council remuneration, and changing the selection process for steward council members.</p>

This thread was originally posted on 9/30. Since then, <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0x41c47d0531dc252c1ae2e4caf256fa7c5f0c09bd71f4c02f543b111d3cf788ab" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">a Snapshot proposal</a> was created and passed with 100% for the proposal. Numerous comments have been added from GitcoinDAO workstream leads and stewards voicing their support for the proposal. Some commenters <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-ratify-the-results-of-grants-round-15-and-formally-request-the-community-multisig-holders-to-payout-matching-allocations/11593/12">posted clarifying questions</a> as well. If you were a GR15 grantee, the post is worth reviewing to better understand the payment process for matching funds, and the status of payments. TL;DR: The GR15 round results have been ratified and matching fund payments will be going out to grantees in the next two weeks.</p>

</a><br>
This post gives a short history of Gitcoin Grants, and outlines its “protocol future”. TL;DR: by creating decentralized, open source protocols we can empower communities in the Ethereum ecosystem to independently run their own grants rounds, to create a more resilient, interdependent, and thriving web3 ecosystem for us all. Creating open grants protocols is a natural progression of GitcoinDAO’s commitment to building and funding digital public goods for all.</li>
