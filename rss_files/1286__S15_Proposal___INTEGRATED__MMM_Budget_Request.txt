https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s15-proposal-integrated-mmm-budget-request/11222
    # Essential Intents

During S15, MMMM will be focus its initiatives on delivering results that support the following Essential Intents (EI) within the DAO:

* Protocol Adoption
* Grants Program Success
* DAO Organization

# TL;DR

In Season 15, MMM will focus our operations on providing streamlined, reliable marketing support to three major areas directly related to our essential intents. We will work to:

1. Support the launch of Grants 2.0 protocols and the growth and adoption of Passport

2. Level up Grants Programs through strategic marketing efforts and streamlining marketing processes round over round

3. Grow the Gitcoin community, deepening engagement & improving brand affinity

4. Improve cross-stream communication by establishing thriving partnerships with other workstreams that create shared alignment on marketing efforts and ops best practices

**MMM underspent significantly against our Season 14 budgets (details outlined below).** More specifically, after proposing our Season 14 budget, we made the following changes in response to market conditions:

1. Postponed planned investments in brand strategy (into Season 15 & 16)

MMM also spent less than budgeted in the following area:

1. Product marketing (hired one part-time, level 2 person supported by a workstream lead). Given workstream lead capacity & market conditions, we were not able to invest as much as we intended in this area. This will change in Season 15.

**Based on what we learned from S14, MMM is making the following changes for S15:**

1. Moving from a team structure with 7 substreams (content, brand & creative, community experience, growth, product marketing, PR/Comms, Ops, Strategy & governance) to a team (and budget) structure with 3 key go-to-market areas and one team support area (see "Team Composition" below)

2. Doubling down on investments in product marketing, shifting resources significantly to support the DAO’s protocol-first strategy

3. Pausing paid engagements with our PR/Comms partner, pausing experimental webdev-projects & canceling several other projects that do not closely align with the DAO’s ratified essential intents

# Amount

MMM’s **S15 budget is $417, 543** (-15% vs S14 budget of $504,635). After accounting for remaining budget & reserves, **MMM is requesting $172,935** for Season 15 from the treasury.

# S15 Goals

In an effort to respond to market conditions, MMM has taken necessary steps to focus the majority of our efforts on marketing our programs and protocols. We have restructured our workstream and workflows to align to 4 major focus areas: Protocols, Programs, Community Engagement, MMM Ops and are committed to operating as lean as possible.

*A note on community engagement:*

Currently, there is an emergent DAO-wide conversation regarding duplicative efforts around community engagement. As MMM carves out its place in community engagement work that is foundational to Gitcoin’s success, it is important to understand how MMM defines community.

Community, as defined by us, can be divided into 4 rudimentary categories (exact segmentation TBD):

|Level of engagement|Audience Segment|
| --- | --- |
|Core|Contributors|
|Second|Stakeholders|
|Third|Participants|
|Fourth|Web3 Citizens|

Each level is categorized by depth of engagement/action in relation to Gitcoin & the level of integrity to our business functions.

From very participatory & integral (core) → less participatory & integral (fourth).

Over the course of S15 MMM will work to **understand our audience segments more deeply** and **create a comprehensive strategy** that will aim to define and align the DAO on roles and responsibilities of each WS as they relate to marketing efforts (grassroots & beyond) across these 4 levels of engagement. Through this process, we will have a **unified strategy for community engagement across the DAO** & our community of fans and stakeholders will be empowered to champion our vision, mission & activities organically. See below for more information on key results as they relate to the community engagement initiatives of MMM.

|Initiative/Dept|Essential Intent|S15 Objective|Key Results|

GTC amounts are rounded values.*

# S15 Priorities

MMM is laser focused on improving the DAO’s overall marketing tactics and operations with a strategic lens. Much of this work will be focused on creating solid marketing foundations for our protocols while also growing our community and grants programs.

In addition to aligning and driving strategic marketing initiatives, our S15 priorities will include social media management, analytics, content development, and protocol branding work.

Below is a list of our top 6 priorities for the next 90 days:

1. Branding for the Protocols suite including new names, a narrative framework, visual identity, and robust content plan
2. Onboarding a fractional product marketing manager to support the launch of the protocols suite
3. Create a comprehensive grants program marketing strategy in partnership with with PGF
4. Publish grantee success stories in the form of blog posts and case studies
5. Develop clear guidelines for what “community engagement” means and looks like at Gitcoin through a community engagement strategy (in collaboration with PGF and DAO Ops)
6. Successful co-marketing partnership product partnership launches with Optimism and Fantom

# Notes on team composition

**Programs & Protocols Squads**

MMM has recently restructured our operations and team structure to create lean, agile cross-functional teams in support of our 4 Essential Intents. 

Program and Protocol teams will each be equipped with a:
<li> Content team
<li> Marketing ops function 
<li> Marketing strategy function

The goal of having these three functions centralized to Programs & Protocols is to support rich context-building amongst contributors within each area. 

At the beginning of S15, the marketing ops role and marketing strategy role will be held by the same person with an opportunity to hire for these functions once roles and responsibilities have been clarified and established.

![MMM S15 Structure|689x404](upload://A2eBUWpFDYNQtcJPpWtNYAUhsFz.jpeg)


**Support Squad**

At the heart of MMM there is a cross-functional team that supports all 3 go-to-market areas. 

This squad is comprised of:
<li>MMM OS contributors
<li> Social media manager
<li> Growth marketer
<li> Brand team 
<li> Dev function

These contributors work across the workstream and in support of the needs of the wider DAO.

<blockquote>
<p>15/26 goals weren’t successful last season. <strong>This season you’re looking to do another 26. Based on S15 priorities, you’re working on mostly planning and strategising which means you’ll miss the GR15 period. This is, honestly, quite worrying.</strong> This is reminiscent of S14 where the notable accomplishments are mostly plans, strategies, decision-making processes too.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree that last season didn’t see a lot of success. I’m confident that under my and <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/viriya">@Viriya</a> 's leadership this won’t happen again.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think when we start playing this game, it becomes quite difficult to time everything - some projects are completed early on, while others later in the season.<br>
I also think this sets a dangerous precedent for setting “easy goals” instead of stretch goals that will actually move the organization forward.</p>

<p>you’re missing a budget for a strategist under grants program marketing &amp; growth (I know Laura’s handling it now but someone specialised in it would help). <strong>Suggest perhaps expanding the community engagement strategist role to encompass it</strong>. In fact, as a side note, I’m curious how do you view strategy? What are the outputs of a strategy? <strong>Because under S15 priorities I see that the outputs are ‘guidelines’.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Apologies for not making this crystal clear. For this season, I will be playing both the Ops and Strategy roles for Protocols marketing (alongside the amazing Julia Pepper). The strategists’ role is ultimately to understand our target audiences and create a cohesive game plan for how to effectively communicate with those audiences so as to increase long term adoption.</p>

            <p>I’m supportive of this budget after reviewing it at a high level and seeing the positive comments from stewards especially those who worked closely with the workstream on feedback. I’m happy to see there will be a unified strategy for community engagement across the DAO as my main concern around workstreams has been duplicated work/roles.</p>

            <p>I echo much of the feedback from the prior comments, and will be voting yes on this budget.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aCxkTYZjfIDvOeKQvfQntPZ8an6s9uIWuqlQrg3MYdE/edit" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">my S14 voter guide</a>, I wrote: <em>My main point of feedback to the workstream is around focus - I believe this budget strives to do too much, at the expense of doing a few things well. I wonder if the S14 list-of-things to do could be pared down even more.</em></p>
<p>As S15 begins, I am seeing this move in the direction I have been hoping for - I’m a huge supporter of the substream simplification effort within MMM this season, moving from seven substreams to three key areas - and I love the clarity with the visuals on team structure. More tactically, the support for the Grants Program ahead of GR15 has been lightyears ahead of prior seasons.</p>
<p>Ahead of S16, I think the big area to figure out will be “Community Engagement” and how MMM, PGF, and DAO Ops collaborate on this effectively. We have had disparate efforts that haven’t successfully coordinated in the past and my hope is that, in S15, we can change this.</p>

<p>I’d like to publicly attest to the drastic shift I’ve seen as a GPC workstream lead and previously Gitcoin Holdings VP of Product. <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/jpepper">@jpepper</a> contributions to product marketing in S14 have been tremendous, but I continued to find overall collaboration with MMM to be a bit rudderless around bringing the Grants 2.0 and Passport protocols to market. Over the last 4-6 weeks we’ve turned a major corner that includes project management across the multiple streams of branding and marketing work required to have a complete GTM plan. <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/clap/3.png?v=12" title=":clap:t3:" class="emoji" alt=":clap:t3:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>While I share some of the perspective around wanting to see more concrete outcomes committed from MMM, I also see and acknowledge the need to slow down to speed up a bit here.  I will be voting to support this budget request.</p>

            <p>Heya MMM, y’all were my first workstream so everytime I comment on the budgets I can really feel the progress!</p>
<p><strong>Good</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>MMM wanting to work with workstreams for some clarity is great. We’ve been trying to figure out how to tap onto MMM’s talent the past year. Experimented with forms, raids, etc</li>
<li>more demos would be healthy, I tend to get a lot of questions about how to use Gitcoin etc</li>
<li>I’ve heard great things about Laura coming in and having some guidance for Grants 2.0 would help</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Could improve</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>15/26 goals weren’t successful last season. <strong>This season you’re looking to do another 26. Based on S15 priorities, you’re working on mostly planning and strategising which means you’ll miss the GR15 period. This is, honestly, quite worrying.</strong> This is reminiscent of S14 where the notable accomplishments are mostly plans, strategies, decision-making processes too.</li>
<li>I would suggest to improve accountability by implementing a <strong>performance based approach</strong>. <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/coachjonathan">@CoachJonathan</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/viriya">@Viriya</a> perhaps you could withold 30% of the budget and if 100% if hit all 30% could go out as a bonus, 75% then 20% goes out etc. <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle">@kyle</a> I hope this isn’t too controversial</li>
<li>I see the <strong>Social media manager role repeated across all 3 squads but in the diagram there is just 1 person</strong>. Previously I think we relied on just cynthia to manage it and I think this is still the model? Could anyone help clarify why we need more people to do it now? Especially if its one Twitter account <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/coachjonathan">@CoachJonathan</a> <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/viriya">@Viriya</a>
</li>
<li>you’re missing a budget for a strategist under grants program marketing &amp; growth (I know Laura’s handling it now but someone specialised in it would help). <strong>Suggest perhaps expanding the community engagement strategist role to encompass it</strong>. In fact, as a side note, I’m curious how do you view strategy? What are the outputs of a strategy? <strong>Because under S15 priorities I see that the outputs are ‘guidelines’.</strong>
</li>
<li>What is the <strong>high-level breakdown of responsibilities</strong> for contributors (esp. those who are PT)? There are 5 FT and 15 PT contributors and some are assigned critical functions like supporting GR side rounds.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Looking forward</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>personally, some added help for community will be helpful and I’m hoping that with better management of the content team we could finally have some media support to put forth the 50+ weeks of library sessions and twitter spaces, a goldmine of content. I will reach out to Mathilda for this</li>
<li>I previously supported on writing (did some of GR13’s posts, lots of tweet summaries, and the digest) I’d like to see this cadence returned and Gitcoin help to push forward the narrative of public goods once more!</li>

            <p>I have reviewed this budget in-depth directly with Laura and have shared my feedback. I also read the positive reviews by the other Stewards under this proposal, and I’ve also read the initial proposal during the CSDO planning meetings. Based on the integrated feedback I will be voting yes on this proposal.</p>

<p>I am excited to see the continued focus on protocol marketing. It looks like there is small amount of budget (maybe only 20%) for those who have not been hired yet, is that right?</p>
<p>Also, I am curious on the community efforts as those have often been uncoordinated from other workstreams.

Ideally we have a solid community engagement plan outlined (that still respects the autonomy each WS wants to have with the community).</p>
<p>Overall, I am supportive of the budget and look forward to a continued focus on Product Marketing, community building in a collaborative way and then the close out of the new website and email marketing tools!</p>

            <p>I think of the purpose of the critique. If I want the workstream to be supported, I do not want my critique to be used as evidence of why not to fund them.</p>
<p>My private critiques are about helping them to be better. I’d actually be happy to discuss them 1 on 1 with any steward who is willing to take the time to understand the broader context.</p>
<p>Also, I don’t think this is the model every steward should use. This is the first season the steward council is assigning council members to a workstream for in-depth review. This model is what I’m using for this very specific situation as a steward council member assigned to MMM.</p>

            <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/pop">@Pop</a> for the summary of our discussion.</p>
<h2>
<a name="a-few-key-things-to-highlight-1" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#a-few-key-things-to-highlight-1"></a>A few key things to highlight</h2>
<h3>
<a name="the-mmm-restructuring-2" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#the-mmm-restructuring-2"></a>The MMM restructuring</h3>
<p>This workstream is undergoing a transformation which the other workstreams seem to feel is positive. Having gone through this with FDD, I wanted to understand if other workstream leads felt there was strong collaboration and effective leadership empowering the workstream to align their outcome to the EI of the DAO. The answer I have found is:</p>
<p><em><strong>Leadership across the DAO is confident in <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/viriya">@Viriya</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/coachjonathan">@CoachJonathan</a> to make the needed changes to align the workstream behind the most impactful efforts in a way that is collaborative and effective.</strong></em></p>
<h3>
<a name="my-steward-opinion-3" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#my-steward-opinion-3"></a>My steward opinion</h3>
<p>In my humble opinion, the role of a steward council member who is assigned to a workstream for an in depth review must be deeply considered. These opinions can heavily influence the way other stewards vote and should not be expressed weakly. The following high level considerations are most important for me in deciding HOW I will approach public vs private critique.</p>
<p><strong>Always Public Critique</strong></p>
<p>If these items are in an acceptable state, I will privately critique the items in the following section.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alignment of work with DAO Essential Intents</li>
<li>Alignment with Roadmaps &amp; Priorities Set by CSDO*</li>
<li>Alignment with Gitcoin Values &amp; Principles*</li>
<li>Leaning into rather than away from collaboration</li>
<li>Follows agreed upon format, terminology, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>*<em>These items have not yet been defined by the DAO, therefore I must use my best understanding of what these are.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>It is my opinion that this budget meets the acceptable standards for each of the above.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Private Critique if the Above is Acceptable</strong></p>
<p>These domains are what I consider private critique as long as the above is in an acceptable state:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prioritization</li>
<li>Accuracy, Definition, and Reporting of Metrics</li>
<li>Competency &amp; Efficiency of Key Individuals</li>
<li>Operational Processes</li>
<li>Pay Rates</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not to say that I have concerns in all these domains with the MMM workstream at this time. I am attempting to set a clearly defined guideline to define how I might best support GitcoinDAO in a position with a high level of responsibility &amp; consequence.</p>
<p>The goal is to avoid micro-managing while assisting the workstream to more effectively use their resources with the help of my perspective and experience.</p>
<h2>
<a name="in-conclusion-4" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#in-conclusion-4"></a>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>In understanding the context around why and how MMM is making bold changes, I <em><strong>intend to vote for this budget</strong></em> provided a willingness to work to alleviate any private critiques I have during the season which leadership from MMM has already shown.</p>

            <p>Thank you, MMM team - <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/disruptionjoe">@DisruptionJoe</a> and myself chatted with the team around their proposal and what may need further clarification and settled on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greater focus on benchmarking with growth marketing metrics (Joe to support)</li>
<li>Specifics on intended growth marketing strategies being implemented for each of the focus areas</li>
<li>Highlight prioritization of initiatives/tasks (i.e., outline high-level context on what is going on at MMM)</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall I think making sure that priority is given to vital areas is important to see MMM achieve its mission of supporting and fuelling the efforts of this DAO. Looking forward to the INTEGRATED proposal.</p>

            <p>Thank you for a very clear write-up and for all you are doing to reposition Gitcoin and support ongoing growth.  Amazing TBH.</p>
<p>The news that in s14 you: " * Created go-to-market metrics" caught my eye.</p>
<p>Could you speak a little more to how metrics are used or will be used to refine marketing efforts?  I know there are some efforts that are very hard to quantify - and others where it is almost too easy to quantify… Is this mostly a growth function?  Would these be used in the future to define success criteria?</p>
<p>Regarding the focus on personas and helping to articulate them at a higher level of depth - how will this be performed w/ GPC and product leadership?  Would product contribute however MMM would take lead in articulating the persona, explaining their characteristics, and so on?  And then product could use these to inform their roadmap?</p>
<p>I see that my questions are not specifically about the amount being spent and rather about metrics and how some work is being divided.  Nonetheless, I hope they are of some value in unpacking a little more MMM’s value and focus.</p>

[S15 Proposal - INTEGRATED] MMM Budget Request
Viriya

            <h1>
<a name="essential-intents-1" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#essential-intents-1"></a>Essential Intents</h1>
<p>During S15, MMMM will be focus its initiatives on delivering results that support the following Essential Intents (EI) within the DAO:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protocol Adoption</li>
<li>Grants Program Success</li>
<li>DAO Organization</li>
</ul>
<h1>
<a name="tldr-2" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#tldr-2"></a>TL;DR</h1>
<p>In Season 15, MMM will focus our operations on providing streamlined, reliable marketing support to three major areas directly related to our essential intents. We will work to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Support the launch of Grants 2.0 protocols and the growth and adoption of Passport</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Level up Grants Programs through strategic marketing efforts and streamlining marketing processes round over round</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grow the Gitcoin community, deepening engagement &amp; improving brand affinity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve cross-stream communication by establishing thriving partnerships with other workstreams that create shared alignment on marketing efforts and ops best practices</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>MMM underspent significantly against our Season 14 budgets (details outlined below).</strong> More specifically, after proposing our Season 14 budget, we made the following changes in response to market conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Postponed planned investments in brand strategy (into Season 15 &amp; 16)</li>
</ol>
<p>MMM also spent less than budgeted in the following area:</p>
<ol>
<li>Product marketing (hired one part-time, level 2 person supported by a workstream lead). Given workstream lead capacity &amp; market conditions, we were not able to invest as much as we intended in this area. This will change in Season 15.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Based on what we learned from S14, MMM is making the following changes for S15:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Moving from a team structure with 7 substreams (content, brand &amp; creative, community experience, growth, product marketing, PR/Comms, Ops, Strategy &amp; governance) to a team (and budget) structure with 3 key go-to-market areas and one team support area (see “Team Composition” below)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doubling down on investments in product marketing, shifting resources significantly to support the DAO’s protocol-first strategy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pausing paid engagements with our PR/Comms partner, pausing experimental webdev-projects &amp; canceling several other projects that do not closely align with the DAO’s ratified essential intents</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1>
<a name="amount-3" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#amount-3"></a>Amount</h1>
<p>MMM’s <strong>S15 budget is $417, 543</strong> (-15% vs S14 budget of $504,635). After accounting for remaining budget &amp; reserves, <strong>MMM is requesting $172,935</strong> for Season 15 from the treasury.</p>

<a name="s15-goals-5" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#s15-goals-5"></a>S15 Goals</h1>
<p>In an effort to respond to market conditions, MMM has taken necessary steps to focus the majority of our efforts on marketing our programs and protocols. We have restructured our workstream and workflows to align to 4 major focus areas: Protocols, Programs, Community Engagement, MMM Ops and are committed to operating as lean as possible.</p>
<p><em>A note on community engagement:</em></p>
<p>Currently, there is an emergent DAO-wide conversation regarding duplicative efforts around community engagement. As MMM carves out its place in community engagement work that is foundational to Gitcoin’s success, it is important to understand how MMM defines community.</p>
<p>Community, as defined by us, can be divided into 4 rudimentary categories (exact segmentation TBD):</p>
<div class="md-table">
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Level of engagement</th>
<th>Audience Segment</th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Core</td>
<td>Contributors</td>

<tr>
<td>Second</td>
<td>Stakeholders</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Third</td>
<td>Participants</td>

<tr>
<td>Fourth</td>

</div><p>Each level is categorized by depth of engagement/action in relation to Gitcoin &amp; the level of integrity to our business functions.</p>
<p>From very participatory &amp; integral (core) → less participatory &amp; integral (fourth).</p>
<p>Over the course of S15 MMM will work to <strong>understand our audience segments more deeply</strong> and <strong>create a comprehensive strategy</strong> that will aim to define and align the DAO on roles and responsibilities of each WS as they relate to marketing efforts (grassroots &amp; beyond) across these 4 levels of engagement. Through this process, we will have a <strong>unified strategy for community engagement across the DAO</strong> &amp; our community of fans and stakeholders will be empowered to champion our vision, mission &amp; activities organically. See below for more information on key results as they relate to the community engagement initiatives of MMM.</p>

<a name="s15-priorities-7" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#s15-priorities-7"></a>S15 Priorities</h1>
<p>MMM is laser focused on improving the DAO’s overall marketing tactics and operations with a strategic lens. Much of this work will be focused on creating solid marketing foundations for our protocols while also growing our community and grants programs.</p>
<p>In addition to aligning and driving strategic marketing initiatives, our S15 priorities will include social media management, analytics, content development, and protocol branding work.</p>
<p>Below is a list of our top 6 priorities for the next 90 days:</p>
<ol>
<li>Branding for the Protocols suite including new names, a narrative framework, visual identity, and robust content plan</li>
<li>Onboarding a fractional product marketing manager to support the launch of the protocols suite</li>
<li>Create a comprehensive grants program marketing strategy in partnership with with PGF</li>
<li>Publish grantee success stories in the form of blog posts and case studies</li>
<li>Develop clear guidelines for what “community engagement” means and looks like at Gitcoin through a community engagement strategy (in collaboration with PGF and DAO Ops)</li>
<li>Successful co-marketing partnership product partnership launches with Optimism and Fantom</li>
</ol>
<h1>
<a name="notes-on-team-composition-8" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#notes-on-team-composition-8"></a>Notes on team composition</h1>
<p><strong>Programs &amp; Protocols Squads</strong></p>
<p>MMM has recently restructured our operations and team structure to create lean, agile cross-functional teams in support of our 4 Essential Intents.</p>
<p>Program and Protocol teams will each be equipped with a:</p>
<li> Content team
</li><li> Marketing ops function 
</li><li> Marketing strategy function
<p>The goal of having these three functions centralized to Programs &amp; Protocols is to support rich context-building amongst contributors within each area.</p>
<p>At the beginning of S15, the marketing ops role and marketing strategy role will be held by the same person with an opportunity to hire for these functions once roles and responsibilities have been clarified and established.</p>
