https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/projects-for-at-risk-kids-community-round-proposal/19312
    What if we made a community round for GG22 supporting projects for at-risk kids? 

**Potential projects:**
-Ava's House Kids Shelter in Chiang Mai, Thailand with Deng Arjaw that I know of through @viviantp6 of G0V/DA0. See here: [http://avahouse.org/](http://avahouse.org/)
-New Hope Shelter in Ba√±os de Agua Santa, Ecuador with Francisco Ayuy that I support: [https://x.com/newhopeshelter](https://x.com/newhopeshelter)
-Wendy Hanamura organizer of dwebcamp.org works with a fund with $600,000 that's trying to reach
1M so they can continuously send investment dividends to projects supporting at risk kids (kinda like Octant using staking rewards from their fund of eth to sustainably support web3 public goods projects)

**Round operator(s)**
If this is accepted as a community round I could be a round operator. 
For experience, I've been a round operator for 2 Zuzalu Gitcoin rounds. 
I would love to be co-operator with others or have others fully take over the operator role.

**Vetting the Projects:**
-Video call interview with a representative from every project
-The project demonstrates they can receive crypto and use it
-Review their social media, website, and financial accounting

**Streaming Donations**
We'd love to set up sponsorships of particular individual kids with recurring monthly payments. Would some sort of recurring payment work through Gitcoin? @garysheng do you have any info on that?

**Video Call Links with Translation Captions**
What if we had every project representative include a link so donors can book a call with them and form a real relationship? 
I think this would provide more value than just financial support. It would lead to greater 2-way learning and a sense of human connection which encourages a greater sense of fulfillment and mutual understanding.
Translation captions are available but you have to pay for it with Google Meet and Zoom. If we can't find any existing free option, I think I'll put out a prize on viaPrize for someone to build this as a free, open-source option for anyone to use perhaps with cal.com which is open-source. Would that work?

**Fiat and Multi-Chain Donations**
Other innovations that would be a big bonus to get ready in time that viaPrize would work on:
-PayPal Donations (already built and used. See here: [https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/we-donated-to-gitcoin-projects-with-credit-card-review-of-paypal-fiat-payments-in-gg21/19287](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/we-donated-to-gitcoin-projects-with-credit-card-review-of-paypal-fiat-payments-in-gg21/19287))
-Credit card donations without PayPal (depends on getting Visa and MasterCard API access)
-Multi-chain donations (using Synaps.io KYC) 

I think GG22 will occur during the Archipelago with 5+ different Zuzalu-ish pop up villages happening in Chiang Mai all at the same time, so I also wonder if that's helpful. Info on that here: https://x.com/noahchonlee/status/1831369974520410376

Would love community input on this idea!

<h3><a name="alignment-with-gitcoins-intents-7" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#alignment-with-gitcoins-intents-7"></a>Alignment with Gitcoin‚Äôs Intents:</h3>
<p>This round will increase Allo GMV by‚Ä¶</p>
<p>-Pulling in donations during this round<br>
-Opening up participation to fiat donors</p>
<p>When we added fiat donations for the OpenCivics GG21 round (see <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/we-donated-to-gitcoin-projects-with-credit-card-review-of-paypal-fiat-payments-in-gg21/19287">here</a>) 7.21% of donations came through fiat. If Gitcoin had this option in place in Grants Stack, it would result in millions more in Allo GMV. We expect the percentage would be significantly higher if the user experience wasn‚Äôt split between two sites, and long-term this opens up the user base to billions of people instead of thousands of L2 users.</p>
<p>Noah plans to write up a proposal for the viaPrize team to build this into grants stack, taking a fee, and splitting the revenue with Gitcoin.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we would add fiat donations the same way as during GG21.</p>
<p>This round would also be new in its focus on social projects, which may open up a new potential user group for Gitcoin.</p>
<h3><a name="anticipated-size-of-the-matching-pool-8" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#anticipated-size-of-the-matching-pool-8"></a>Anticipated Size of the Matching Pool:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The matching pool is anticipated to be $5,000, fundraised through kind-hearted individuals contacted through Twitter and the Gitcoin forum.</li>
<li>Funding address: 0x850a146D7478dAAa98Fc26Fd85e6A24e50846A9d</li>
<li>We have a clear plan in place for future fundraising, including sharing stories from the grantee communities on social networks.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="advisors-for-this-round-9" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#advisors-for-this-round-9"></a>Advisors for This Round:</h3>
<p>TBD</p>
<h3><a name="funding-mechanism-10" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#funding-mechanism-10"></a>Funding Mechanism:</h3>
<p>Our default plan is to use quadratic funding because it is easier to convince people to donate when they know it will be matched.</p>
<p>We are also in discussion with Flow State to see if quadratic streaming would make sense for this round.</p>
<h3><a name="community-size-and-engagement-11" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#community-size-and-engagement-11"></a>Community Size and Engagement:</h3>
<p>We are planning to include 10-20 projects in the round.</p>
<p>We believe this is a reasonable number for us to thoroughly review during the application period. We are also learning from how the most recent Open Civics round chose a number of projects in this range to make sure the time spent by grantees fundraising is worthwhile.</p>
<p>If we count Ava‚Äôs House and New Hope Shelter as representative projects, each has around 50 people in the TG group or mailing list and roughly 30 donors. The estimated average monthly donations between the two projects is $600.</p>
<p>This could mean an estimate of a community size across all projects of 500-1000 with perhaps 300-600 donors giving $6,000-$12,000 if this were a normal fundraiser. We believe that the Gitcoin community, social network, and matching funds will pull in many new donors to these projects, as well.</p>
<h3><a name="type-of-projects-to-fund-12" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#type-of-projects-to-fund-12"></a>Type of Projects to Fund:</h3>
<ul>
<li>We aim to fund projects that support youth in need through kids‚Äô shelters and related services, such as safe housing, counseling, and crisis intervention programs.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="estimated-number-of-eligible-grantees-13" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#estimated-number-of-eligible-grantees-13"></a>Estimated Number of Eligible Grantees:</h3>
<ul>
<li>We believe that thousands of grantees will be eligible to apply for this round. There are many amazing kids‚Äô shelters, orphanages, and other programs supporting vulnerable youth worldwide.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="impact-assessment-plan-14" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#impact-assessment-plan-14"></a>Impact Assessment Plan:</h3>
<p>Describe how you intend to assess grantee impact through methods such as Hypercerts, GAP, Deresy, etc., and provide details of the plan, including how you will measure and evaluate the success and impact of the grantees over successive rounds.</p>
<ul>
<li>We intend to assess grantee impact through Karma Gap updates. Our detailed plan includes sending a follow-up to the projects 3 months after the round to request that they report to us how they have used the funds. In case they struggle to make a report on Karma Gap, we will ask them to also send updates in a Google form and we will add the updates to a Karma Gap project representing the whole round on their behalf.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="additional-considerations-15" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#additional-considerations-15"></a>Additional Considerations:</h3>
<p>Community members should consider THE CHILDREN.</p>

<p>Noah supports <a href="https://x.com/newhopeshelter" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">New Hope Shelter</a> in Ecuador<br>
Mozhi is founding <a href="https://buildtobecome.club/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Build to Become</a> as a mentorship program for students<br>
We both would be happier if our projects are part of the round.</p>

            <p>Curious peoples thoughts:<br>
Should it just be for kids shelters?<br>
Should it be more broad for projects supporting vulnerable youth including education, nutritional, mentorship initiatives etc?<br>
Should it be for individual kids to get sponsored?</p>
<p>However we do this I‚Äôd really love to include call links and encourage people to form real relationships with people they‚Äôre giving to</p>

            <p>I support this concept. <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/noahchonlee">@noahchonlee</a>, you should check out the eligibility criteria for GG22 Community Rounds and see if it could be a way to pursue this with us.</p>

            <p>Thank you for putting this together Noah! It would be interesting to see Gitcoin go beyond Web3/Open-source and connect more with the real world <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> Also very excited to onboard more marginalized communities to the ecosystem.</p>

            <p>What if we made a community round for GG22 supporting projects for at-risk kids?</p>
<p><strong>Potential projects:</strong><br>
-Ava‚Äôs House Kids Shelter in Chiang Mai, Thailand with Deng Arjaw that I know of through <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/viviantp6">@viviantp6</a> of G0V/DA0. See here: <a href="http://avahouse.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://avahouse.org/</a><br>
-New Hope Shelter in Ba√±os de Agua Santa, Ecuador with Francisco Ayuy that I support: <a href="https://x.com/newhopeshelter" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://x.com/newhopeshelter</a><br>
-Wendy Hanamura organizer of <a href="http://dwebcamp.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">dwebcamp.org</a> works with a fund with $600,000 that‚Äôs trying to reach<br>
1M so they can continuously send investment dividends to projects supporting at risk kids (kinda like Octant using staking rewards from their fund of eth to sustainably support web3 public goods projects)</p>
<p><strong>Round operator(s)</strong><br>
If this is accepted as a community round I could be a round operator.<br>
For experience, I‚Äôve been a round operator for 2 Zuzalu Gitcoin rounds.<br>
I would love to be co-operator with others or have others fully take over the operator role.</p>
<p><strong>Vetting the Projects:</strong><br>
-Video call interview with a representative from every project<br>
-The project demonstrates they can receive crypto and use it<br>
-Review their social media, website, and financial accounting</p>
<p><strong>Streaming Donations</strong><br>
We‚Äôd love to set up sponsorships of particular individual kids with recurring monthly payments. Would some sort of recurring payment work through Gitcoin? <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/garysheng">@garysheng</a> do you have any info on that?</p>
<p><strong>Video Call Links with Translation Captions</strong><br>
What if we had every project representative include a link so donors can book a call with them and form a real relationship?<br>
I think this would provide more value than just financial support. It would lead to greater 2-way learning and a sense of human connection which encourages a greater sense of fulfillment and mutual understanding.<br>
Translation captions are available but you have to pay for it with Google Meet and Zoom. If we can‚Äôt find any existing free option, I think I‚Äôll put out a prize on viaPrize for someone to build this as a free, open-source option for anyone to use perhaps with <a href="http://cal.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">cal.com</a> which is open-source. Would that work?</p>
<p><strong>Fiat and Multi-Chain Donations</strong><br>
Other innovations that would be a big bonus to get ready in time that viaPrize would work on:<br>
-PayPal Donations (already built and used. See here: <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/we-donated-to-gitcoin-projects-with-credit-card-review-of-paypal-fiat-payments-in-gg21/19287">https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/we-donated-to-gitcoin-projects-with-credit-card-review-of-paypal-fiat-payments-in-gg21/19287</a>)<br>
-Credit card donations without PayPal (depends on getting Visa and MasterCard API access)<br>
-Multi-chain donations (using <a href="http://Synaps.io" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Synaps.io</a> KYC)</p>
<p>I think GG22 will occur during the Archipelago with 5+ different Zuzalu-ish pop up villages happening in Chiang Mai all at the same time, so I also wonder if that‚Äôs helpful. Info on that here: <a href="https://x.com/noahchonlee/status/1831369974520410376" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">x.com</a></p>
<p>Would love community input on this idea!</p>
