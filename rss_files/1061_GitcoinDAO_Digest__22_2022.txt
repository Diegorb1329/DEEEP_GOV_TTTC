## üî• Hot Topics:

* [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary) announces he is [Passing the Torch](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/passing-the-torch/10971) as Gitcoin Holdings transfers assets to Gitcoin Foundation and disaffiliates from the DAO. There have been [over 119 threads](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary) authored by Owocki on the governance forum to help share his context. Now, he hopes this departure will help the DAO focus on ‚Äúcreating a culture where its members always seek to decentralize power, and avoid entrenching leadership.‚Äù In parting, Owocki shares: ‚ÄúGitcoin has been my baby for almost 5 years now, [many ups & downs](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-great-bear-the-great-reset-the-great-revival/9855/2), and it is very bittersweet to see it growing up and ‚Äòleaving the house.‚Äô‚Äù

* [Bear Market Vibes](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/bear-market-vibes/10948) from [Kyle](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle/summary) calls out that the DAO‚Äôs impact matters and there is a need to ensure ‚Äúwe have the capital on hand to weather a global economic downturn.‚Äù With Season 15 around the corner (~ 6 weeks), the DAO needs to reduce our costs, diversify our treasury, and explore new strategies. These could include ‚Äúincreasing depth of liquidity, increase volume of trades, increasing utility of GTC and exploring some passive yield generation opportunities.‚Äù

* [Shreyas](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/helloshreyas/summary) shares a [Gitcoin Treasury Diversification Update](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-treasury-diversification-update/10932) proposing ‚Äúmoving $15 million of GTC (~4.6m GTC at time of writing) to a multisig wallet.‚Äù If approved, $3M of this amount would be swapped into USDC by an agency desk while strategic partners are confirmed for swapping the remaining $12M.

* [GTC will be entered into the upcoming C.o.R.E 4](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/improve-gtc-liquidity-with-tokemak/10725/10) by Tokemak, shares [Schlabach](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/schlabach/summary) from[ Llamas](http://llamas.xyz/). [Collateralization of Reactors Event (C.o.R.E)](https://www.tokemak.xyz/core) is a competition to win a token reactor that would ‚Äúgenerate deep, sustainable liquidity for DeFi and future tokenized applications.‚Äù

* [DisruptionJoe](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/disruptionjoe/summary) shares that [Airdrop Farming](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/airdrop-farming/10938) is ‚Äúthe act of donating with the intention of getting an airdrop, not for the intention of signaling support for that public good in a QF round.‚Äù Individuals who have made multiple accounts to airdrop farm are engaging in Sybil behavior and will be squelched to prevent the accounts from affecting matching fund distribution.

* There is a lively discussion happening around [compensation commitment](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-compensation-commitment/10830/) within the DAO. The conversation focuses on whether the DAO should be paying high US salary rates, the current market, and the importance of salary transparency.

* Listen to the latest episodes from [Kevin Owocki](https://twitter.com/owocki)‚Äôs [Green Pill](https://availableon.com/greenpill) podcast!
  * [Episode #18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AIMpDl6tPI&list=PLmkdAgtxf3ah0Vmyy1B3OU8BPacX4_gVY&index=18) is a conversation on Collective Organization with [Pia Mancini](https://twitter.com/piamancini?s=20&t=5ZvUv_PbnvmEFxAbnaQ7NA), co-founder of [Democracy Earth](https://twitter.com/democracyearth) and [Open Collective](https://twitter.com/opencollect), drilling into how DAOs can learn to govern more effectively, ‚Äúexit to community‚Äù, and create new institutions for the internet generation.
  * [Episode #19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-f0G18HZzM&list=PLmkdAgtxf3ah0Vmyy1B3OU8BPacX4_gVY&index=19) is a panel about Grants Round 14 and the modular future of Gitcoin Grants featuring: [Scott Moore](https://twitter.com/notscottmoore), cofounder and PGF workstream lead; [Annika Lewis](https://twitter.com/AnnikaSays), PGF workstream lead; [Kevin Olsen](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kevin.olsen/), VP of Engineering; [Lindsey Thrift](https://twitter.com/thrift_lindsey), VP of Product; and [Austin Griffith](https://twitter.com/austingriffith), GitcoinDAO steward.

* The turnout for GR14 has blown us away! In the midst of a hungry bear market, our contributors have shown up. GR14 has raised over $500k in the same amount of time as GR13 raised $200k. Regens unite!

* We‚Äôre making sure we close out GR14 strong in the next few days and keep things running smoothly. In the meantime, we‚Äôve already started fundraising for GR15 by forging community partnerships for raising matching funds.

* Come find out more about public goods at our live events next week!

* Gitcoin Passport: In collaboration with the Grants 2.0 workstream, we‚Äôve been super busy responding to the feedback we‚Äôve been getting from launching our alpha product in GR14! We‚Äôre making upgrades to our [Ceramic](https://ceramic.network/) infrastructure to support the heavy network traffic.

* Governance Operations Scaling: We‚Äôve drafted an initial, prioritized problem statement and proposed solutions. Now, we‚Äôre making sure this is in alignment with the perspectives of our DAO stewards.

* Grants Intelligence Agency: We review thousands of grants each season to ensure the community‚Äôs intentions are served. Here‚Äôs a look at the process we use to review grants for eligibility before handing them off to the Grants Operations team to review the tags.

* Data Operations: Our Sybil Account Detection (SAD) model has been running every 12-24 hours throughout GR14 to improve the user experience. At this point in the round, we begin to add data from the Sybil hunters to adjust to new information.

* Operating System: Our workflow now includes two important meetings: Mondays at 5 pm is our weekly update which is open to anyone who wants to know what is happening in FDD. On Thursdays, our outcome owners (core) and trusted contributors participate in a process & decision-making meeting. The rest of the week is async with multiple work-in-public sessions.

* CSDO: We‚Äôre upgrading our CSDO calls to enable more work and deeper discussion to happen async. On this week‚Äôs call, we discussed ratifying updates to our DAO purpose and essential intents, the need to educate our community about Sybil airdrop farming, and guidance on paying contributors in the bear market.

* GR14 is keeping our user support team busy and we are closing out tickets as fast as we can. Most tickets are requesting help with the new Gitcoin passport, missing contributions, and log-in errors.

Now, he hopes this departure will help the DAO focus on ‚Äúcreating a culture where its members always seek to decentralize power, and avoid entrenching leadership.‚Äù In parting, Owocki shares: ‚ÄúGitcoin has been my baby for almost 5 years now, <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-great-bear-the-great-reset-the-great-revival/9855/2">many ups &amp; downs</a>, and it is very bittersweet to see it growing up and ‚Äòleaving the house.‚Äô‚Äù</p>

<p>The turnout for GR14 has blown us away! In the midst of a hungry bear market, our contributors have shown up. GR14 has raised over $500k in the same amount of time as GR13 raised $200k. Regens unite!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We‚Äôre making sure we close out GR14 strong in the next few days and keep things running smoothly. In the meantime, we‚Äôve already started fundraising for GR15 by forging community partnerships for raising matching funds.</p>

<p>Gitcoin Passport: In collaboration with the Grants 2.0 workstream, we‚Äôve been super busy responding to the feedback we‚Äôve been getting from launching our alpha product in GR14!

<li>
<p>Data Operations: Our Sybil Account Detection (SAD) model has been running every 12-24 hours throughout GR14 to improve the user experience. At this point in the round, we begin to add data from the Sybil hunters to adjust to new information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operating System: Our workflow now includes two important meetings: Mondays at 5 pm is our weekly update which is open to anyone who wants to know what is happening in FDD. On Thursdays, our outcome owners (core) and trusted contributors participate in a process &amp; decision-making meeting. The rest of the week is async with multiple work-in-public sessions.
