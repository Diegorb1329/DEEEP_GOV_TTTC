# TLDR

This post describes how [RadicalxChange Voice](https://voice.radicalxchange.org/ ) might improve the collective decision-making processes in the context of DAOs in general and GitcoinDAO workstreams specifically.

# Shared Goal Formation

Groups of people collaborating without a robust set of democratic rules often default back to a hierarchical, top-down decision-making arrangement. In other words, the Schelling point of unorganized collaboration, even in the DAO age, continues to be a traditional boss-employer relationship.

Organizing groups without democratic mechanisms often lead to power concentrations from a few charismatic leaders - the loudest voices in the room dominate. Therefore, formal rules and boundaries are essential to help individuals negotiate the shared resources and vision of the group.

With the help of new DAO-native tools, we are able to construct systems that are more fair, inclusive, and democratic. We should strive for more social dimensions of progress and systems for shared goal formation based on participatory democratic mechanisms.

# RadicalxChange Voice: Democracy¬≤

[RadicalxChange](https://radicalxchange.org/) (RxC) is a global movement for next-generation political economies founded by political economist @GlenWeyl in 2018. RxC is committed to advancing plurality, equality, community, and decentralization through upgrading democracy, markets, the data economy, the commons and identity.

[RxC Voice](https://voice.radicalxchange.org/) is an [open-source](https://github.com/RadicalxChange/rxc-voice) web app that allows groups to evolve and leverage collective intelligence to rapidly make decisions together. Using RxC Voice, a cooperative can filter signal from noise and align the group towards shared ideals and outcomes. We believe that RxC Voice can help move DAOs towards more pluralistic governance as it amplifies the whole group's shared beliefs instead of just the dominant voices.

# Using RxC Voice

The RxC Voice process is divided into 3 stages. **Each step of the process is anonymous**, it's not possible to gain insight into how individuals vote, nor can individuals prove to other participants how they‚Äôve voted. The stages are as follows;

**Stage 1: Delegation** - Members of the group are asked to delegate Voice Credits to boost the impact of their peers. The delegated credits are then matched using quadratic funding with a matching pool 100 times the number of delegates.

**Stage 2: Deliberation** - Members are invited to add and explore statements by the group on [Polis](https://pol.is/home). Members may submit any statement or comments that express their ideas, feelings, or principles relevant to the conversation.

**Stage 3: Election** - Actionable common grounds are identified by quadratically voting on the statements from stage 2 by either agreeing or disagreeing. At the end of this stage a set of the most agreed upon statements are identified and presented.

If you‚Äôd like to see how this works in practice - check out the [2-minute introduction](https://youtu.be/YWRRTO9zuks) of RxC Voice.

# Initial Experiments in Gitcoin

Considering how GitcoinDAO operates with contributor-driven workstreams, we see collaborative road-mapping as a natural fit for RxC Voice. With RxC Voice, workstreams can harness the richness of their collective intelligence in order to form better roadmaps, budgets and priorities which align workstream operations with shared contributor goals.

The emerging [Builderband](https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/Builderband-6145889998bd4225a41a917367890630), Gitcoin's alumni network of builders, applied RxC Voice to [prioritize its activities for Q1 2022](https://github.com/builderband/pm/issues/12). As the next application within Gitcoin, we propose to implement RxC Voice with the contributors of the [MMM Workstream](https://m-m-m.xyz/). If the experiment is successful, MMM aims to incorporate the results in the Season 14 budget proposal. The RxC Voice pilot in MMM will take place half way into Season 13 and center around the question:

***- What activities should the MMM workstream prioritize in Season 14?***

# Giving DAOs a Shared Voice

In identifying potential RxC Voice product improvements specific to Gitcoin, we might consider starting a formal collaboration with RxC Foundation to help suit our needs. Similar to how the executive branch of the [Colorado government worked with RxC](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/quadratic-voting-in-colorado-2020/) and quadratic voting to address interdisciplinary issues. If proven successful at MMM, RxC Voice could be applied for cross-workstream and DAO-wide cooperation as well for rapid, democratic, decision -making.

We are excited about the use cases of RxC Voice and see an excellent opportunity to apply it within GitcoinDAO's executive teams. We look forward to experimenting together with RxC Foundation and, hopefully, bringing more plurality and collective intelligence to GitcoinDAO. We invite anyone interested to connect with us as we *jump* into this experiment!

            <p>Thank you!<br>
I‚Äôve very happy with the contributor participation, I think this was really successful. We got valuable and actionable items that we will incorporate into our upcoming budget.<br>
More information on the results can be found here: <a href="https://bit.ly/MMMRXC_" class="inline-onebox">RadicalxChange Voice - Google Slides</a></p>
<p>Results will be discussed during our upcoming Workstream sync next week!</p>

            <p>Here is an overview of the recent RxC Voice pilot results in the Memes, Merch, and Marketing workstream. The pilot centered around the question: <strong>What activities should MMM prioritize in Season 14?</strong></p>
<p>To recap ‚Äî 23 of the active contributors in the MMM workstream signed up as participants for the decision and quadratically delegated voice credits to each other. They then formed proposals through Pol.is and finally, prioritized them in a quadratic vote.</p>
<p>Here are the complete results of that concluding vote.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the feedback Murat,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The purpose of <strong>Stage 1</strong> is to collectively distribute voice credits to trusted individuals within the group. The delegated credits are then matched via quadratic funding to democratically allocate credits according to the will of the collective. This helps reduce the impact of information asymmetry and varying levels of context for the election process in <strong>Stage 3</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ambition of this initial experiment with RxC Voice in MMM is to more effectively incorporate contributors‚Äô opinions and thoughts in the upcoming Season 14 budget proposal. At this point RxC Voice will not be used on a project level.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We‚Äôre currently planning a workshop/AMA prior to the launch next week, more details on this will be shared soon!</p>
<p>EDIT: An introduction/AMA will be held this Friday at 3pm UTC togheter with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/erich">@erich</a> <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/anoanoano">@anoanoano</a> &amp; <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/alexrandaccio">@alexrandaccio</a>.

            <p><strong>I‚Äôm supportive of this transition and excited about experimenting with this in our works in MMM.</strong></p>
<p>I would like to explain my concern raised while reading this.</p>
<ol>
<li>There are experienced people and less experienced people per project. And leaving the decision making to those experienced people is the best choice according to my experience in MMM.</li>
<li>We mostly trust your <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/fred">@Fred</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/seedphrase">@seedphrase</a> feedback about our works because you carry the brand values and give the right direction for a work.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>In short, will we lose the decision making based on experience and expertise?</strong></p>
<p>Maybe this concern is unrelevant and and RxC already has a solution for this.</p>
<p>This looks like great opportunity to build collective intelligence. Thanks <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/alexrandaccio">@alexrandaccio</a> <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/anoanoano">@anoanoano</a></p>
