* Content standardization is in progress, including better links to the OpenAPI playground tool and the creation of a Data dictionary to define what fields deliver via the API, as well as ongoing Information Architecture reviews.

* Automated docs and tools, simplified Passport introduction, and Nextra migration are under planning.

* Supermodular team has built a [Passport-gated faucet starter](https://gc-passport-faucet.vercel.app/) that can be forked and run on any network. Prebuilt Passport components are under planning.

* Citizen Round case study has kicked-off. Schelling Point Paris planning is in progress.

* Gitcoin Grants concept development, channel audit/revisit, persona review, and documentation are underway.

Gitcoin Digest #13 2023

            <p>Hello everyone I was trying to find how to open a new post but can‚Äôt find it.<br>
So I am gonna post my thoughts here about the Gitcoin Passport.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I really think a Gitcoin Passport for kids would be a great initiative don‚Äôt know about details, but maybe kids can open a wallet and check their passports with Roblox stamp and kind of different games. If they have more games stamps they will be able to reach their score. To be clear I am not saying their contributions will count as the same of an adult contribution but at least they can have a passport and donate and verify their stamps. Maybe kinds can have a multiplier 0,25 times an adult have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For adults passport is really difficult to get for people that is not involved in web3 and are kind of new with wallets.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>-GitHub stamp is only for developers because nobody use GitHub unless you are a developer or are involved in Web3.<br>
-Discord stamp is a good stamp but only for Web3 people and gamers, if you want to onboard new people and help them to get the passport they normally don‚Äôt have this stamp.<br>
-Twitter stamp in some countries like Latam countries is not used too much people use instead of Twitter Instagram so would be nice to add an Instagram Stamp or SnapchatStamp or why not WhatsApp? I mean those are not web3 friendly stuff but we are trying is to avoid Sybil attacks so this stamps works for verify people are unique.</p>
