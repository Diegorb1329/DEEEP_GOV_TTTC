# 🔥 Hot Topics

## 🐦 From Twitter

## ☑️ From the Governance Forum

 *This week, we continued our discussions about the V2 Stewards Council, and how best to run GR16.*

* [**Proposal: V2 of the Steward Council**](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-v2-of-the-steward-council/11639/1)**, by** [**shawn16400**
](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/shawn16400)
Last week, Shawn16400 posted this proposal to improve the Steward Council. Since then, the proposal has gone to Snapshot! The proposal runs until Oct 25, 2022, 9:00 AM.

  **[Add your vote here.](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0x3c66d92024528cdcac3d541cfaf1842d4539f4b577e9a95ff6c62285506e1f26)**

* **[[Request for feedback] Proposed Future for the Grant Programs and GR16 as we Transition to the Protocol](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/request-for-feedback-proposed-future-for-the-grant-programs-and-gr16-as-we-transition-to-the-protocol/11624/7), by [Janine
](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/J9leger)** 
This proposal was also shared in the Digest last week. Since then, the active discussion has continued, with numerous thoughtful comments by GitcoinDAO community members.

  From last week:

   *“In the proposal, Janine proposes that GitcoinDAO should consider running a modified, smaller Grants Round for GR16 in December, or perhaps not running a Grants Round at all, so that Gitcoin workstreams can focus their attention towards shipping the new grants protocols(Passport, Grants Hub, Round Manager).”*

  **Catch up on the discussion and [add your thoughts here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/request-for-feedback-proposed-future-for-the-grant-programs-and-gr16-as-we-transition-to-the-protocol/11624/22).**

* **[Knowledge Transfer: Getting 1000x more sybil resistance out of POAP](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/knowledge-transfer-getting-1000x-more-sybil-resistance-out-of-poap/11677), by [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/knowledge-transfer-getting-1000x-more-sybil-resistance-out-of-poap/11677)**

  Owocki explores how the DAO might use POAP x Gitcoin Passport to create “1000x more sybil resistance”. Replies in the comments explore ways to flesh out the concept, and how to **[potentially offer a bounty to research how to build this](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/knowledge-transfer-getting-1000x-more-sybil-resistance-out-of-poap/11677/2?u=alexdwagner).**

* **[FDD: some security & privacy issues in a protocol based grants system](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/fdd-some-security-privacy-issues-in-a-protocol-based-grants-system/11678), by [j-cook](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/j-cook)** 
  
  This post summarizes the discussions around privacy and security happening in FDD. TL;DR: The transition to Grants 2.0 is a huge opportunity to level up public goods funding in web3. However, this large upgrade brings with it a new set of attack vectors and privacy concerns that must be mitigated. Overall, increased security and privacy are the likely outcomes from the transition thanks to the removal of data from the protocol through the integration of Gitcoin Passport.

## 📰 From the Gitcoin Blog This Week

* **[The Secret to a Healthy web3 Community](https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/essence-of-a-healthy-web3-community), by Alex Wagner**

  Alex writes about how Web3 projects survive and thrive because of their communities, with a focus on cultivating healthy dev communities in your ecosystem, as well as how exactly community helps your web3 ecosystem grow.

</a><br>
Last week, Shawn16400 posted this proposal to improve the Steward Council. Since then, the proposal has gone to Snapshot! The proposal runs until Oct 25, 2022, 9:00 AM.</p>

</a></strong><br>
This proposal was also shared in the Digest last week. Since then, the active discussion has continued, with numerous thoughtful comments by GitcoinDAO community members.</p>
<p>From last week:</p>
<p><em>“In the proposal, Janine proposes that GitcoinDAO should consider running a modified, smaller Grants Round for GR16 in December, or perhaps not running a Grants Round at all, so that Gitcoin workstreams can focus their attention towards shipping the new grants protocols(Passport, Grants Hub, Round Manager).”</em></p>
<p><strong>Catch up on the discussion and <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/request-for-feedback-proposed-future-for-the-grant-programs-and-gr16-as-we-transition-to-the-protocol/11624/22">add your thoughts here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Owocki explores how the DAO might use POAP x Gitcoin Passport to create “1000x more sybil resistance”. Replies in the comments explore ways to flesh out the concept, and how to <strong><a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/knowledge-transfer-getting-1000x-more-sybil-resistance-out-of-poap/11677/2">potentially offer a bounty to research how to build this</a>.</strong></p>

<p>This post summarizes the discussions around privacy and security happening in FDD. TL;DR: The transition to Grants 2.0 is a huge opportunity to level up public goods funding in web3. However, this large upgrade brings with it a new set of attack vectors and privacy concerns that must be mitigated. Overall, increased security and privacy are the likely outcomes from the transition thanks to the removal of data from the protocol through the integration of Gitcoin Passport.</p>
