[S16 Proposal - INTEGRATED] MMM Budget Request
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s16-proposal-integrated-mmm-budget-request/11782
    <h2>TL;DR</h2>

In Season 16, MMM will continue to focus on providing support for the Grants Protocol launch, the Grants Program Success and Community Engagement. To do so, we are requesting a budget of $471,949.

Our top priorities for this season include:

* Finalize overall Gitcoin, protocol, Passport and Grants Program branding strategies
* Launch (or make significant headway in launching) a new gitcoin.co website
* Developing and socializing communications around GR16, the sunsetting of the centralized grants platform (cGrants) and our transition to the protocol
* Developing and releasing an Impact Report to highlight the success of the Gitcoin Grants Program
* Develop and test an engagement strategy that targets three core community audiences (which were identified and researched in S15)

**Amount**

MMM’s S16 budget is $471,949 (+13% vs S15 budget of $417,543). After accounting for remaining budget & reserves, MMM is requesting $686,239 for Season 16 from the treasury.

There are several reasons for a 13% increase in our budget. Listed below are initiatives that we are newly taking on in an effort to prepare ourselves for a successful launch of our Grants Protocol:

* Absorption of the grassroots initiative
* Building and launching a new Gitcoin.co website [a new initiative]
* Development of more robust strategies around partnerships, influencer marketing and PR & Comms
* Integration of Schelling Point event from a brand & creative standpoint
* Visual refresh of the Gitcoin brand, Grants Program and Grants Protocol
* Increased efforts to market Passport
* UNICEF round promotion

# Milestone Report

All in all, MMM performed well in terms of tracking to S15 OKRs. There were many changing priorities over the course of the season which resulted in a lot of ![:black_circle:|20x20](upload://ckfoPBq8PWwU9bdhjTeaLRb55J8.png ":black_circle:"). This likely had to do with a change in leadership at MMM and a lack of context on what the DAO needed at the time of budgeting. There were also several ![:red_circle:|20x20](upload://7xnA8L1w6Ey9gzsttgy4zJRSGNZ.png ":red_circle:") that mostly had to do with metrics that were mostly out of MMM’s control. This is a great learning for the team to set OKRs directly related to outputs within our control.

# S16 Goals

The outcomes below lack metrics compared to last season. The reason for this is:

1. Protocols - over the next 3 months, the Grants Protocol and Passport are still in early stages of development and are not driving toward any particular metrics. As such, MMM will abstain from setting any unnecessary metrics-driven goals.
2. Program - since we will be running a small Grants Round with minimal promotional effort, we will mostly be focused on executing according to requests from the PGF team while monitoring existing benchmarks on Twitter and through email.
3. Research-backed content - this season, our content team is going to be wholly focused on experimenting with different channels and types of content, playing with headlines, formats, etc. in order to better understand our audiences and their needs come S17. Our main focus this season is on running experiments, measuring and running more experiments. With our learnings, we will be prepared come S17 to create high impact, desirable content for our audiences.

Generally, MMM is focused on Protocols delivery even/over Program delivery. That said, we always strive to deliver 100% on all fronts.

# Budget Breakdown

A note on the breakdown below:

MMM is mostly composed of part-time freelancers working across a number of different projects. In many instances, individuals’ work touches all aspects of the DAO and we did our best to reflect that in our budget.

<i>Note:

A denomination in dollar amount will be prioritized in budget proposals over GTC - if the spot price assumed at the time of posting ($2.40 on Nov.7, 2022) this document on the forum changes between then and when the budget gets proposed on-chain, the GTC amount will be readjusted to reflect the USD amount above. GTC amounts are rounded values.</I>

[S16 Proposal - INTEGRATED] MMM Budget Request
GClayMiller

            <p><strong>Brand new Steward, lacking context. Apologies if questions and comments are naive while I get my footing</strong></p>
<p>MMM has been the work stream I have followed most closely since engaging with Gitcoin—and also where I have the most friends in the organization—so I know they have been doing great work. However, it is a bit shocking to see an increased budget request for marketing during current market conditions. In fact, Gitcoin is the ONLY non-institutional organization I have spoken to in the last 6 months that plans to increase their marketing budget, which is usually the first to be cut in circumstances like these.</p>
<p>Granted, with the rollout of the protocols there is a necessity for making people aware and driving user acquisition—I just wonder if there is a better cadence or sequence of events that would allow for product development to proceed while MMM ‘HODLs’ until conditions improve. I noticed a lot of S15 goals were not hit due to “grants protocols weren’t mature enough” which signals to me that there is misalignment on roadmap &amp; timeline between work streams. Similarly, MMM’s task of protocol adoption will be significantly more challenging in the current market. It is a bit relieving to hear that you are pulling back on metric-driven goals related to adoption until the protocols have matured, but I would still encourage the team to set any relevant KPIs around the research &amp; strategy objectives under the ‘Protocol’ and ‘Community’ pillars. Further, despite very similar budget requests for Protocol &amp; Community (~159k each), it would appear that Community has a much lighter lift of tasks. A further breakdown or KPIs would help explain this.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, I know the work that MMM does is essential and that their contributors are hardworking &amp; well-intentioned. This proposal is well thought out and thorough, but arrived at a time when there seems to be a wider ongoing debate on the DAO’s spending. From reviewing all 5 of the recent budget proposals, my gut tells me that there is a lot of money, time, and energy to be saved with better effort on Cross-DAO-Coordination efforts. Duplicated efforts and misaligned roadmaps/timing often results in a lot of waste! Looking forward to following the discussions on this moving forward.</p>

<p>I appreciate these perspectives and I really look forward to having the Steward Council active so that folks can help advise on where/how they would like to see cuts.</p>
<p>So much of what MMM does has far reaching impact, and we are still working to evolve as the Protocols come online. As I look what the team is doing, there is maybe 20% of it I could see us punting on (for 3-6mos) but it would put us behind (IMO).</p>
<p>Startups hit a trough of spending right before they break out of the atmosphere. In our case, our ambition is to launch the protocols and really work to make sure those are impactful for communities who want to build on them. I am not sure that meaningful cuts would allow for us to have that impact. but, I am certainly in the forest and may be having a hard time seeing through the trees.</p>

            <p>I agree with lefteris, MMM does great work, that said, IMO, we need to make cuts and the only way the stewards can signal it is by voting no.</p>
<p>I am going to vote no on all work streams until we get our spending under control. This is the only thing I can do, and I hope other Stewards will follow suit. We have given strong warnings over the last few seasons and they don’t seem to be working.</p>
<p>We cannot spend this much money in this market.</p>
<p>I am happy to work with the Gitcoin Hiring team to explain how Giveth finds intrinsically motivated high caliber contributors in lower income countries to keep our budget at 1/10th of the cost.</p>

            <p>While I do appreciate all the work this workstream has been putting I can’t agree with the budget request.</p>
<p>I echo what <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/epowell101">@epowell101</a> says and can promise him he is not alone in his thinking.</p>
<p>We are going through one of the most aggressive bear markets with the whole crypto sentiment being as negative as it can be. At the same time the macro outlook of the global economy is also terrible which points us to really hard times ahead.</p>
<p>This DAO spends like nothing is happening. I firmly believe there should be aggressive reduction in  expenses and the MMM workstream seems to me like a good to have, but not essential to the operation of Gitcoin. As such I am voting No.</p>

            <p>Since I joined a year and smth ago I have closely watched the evolution of the MMM workstream. It has evolved from a kinda centralized action based team to a more decentralized one(imo).</p>
<p>Just the talent pool, dedication  and impact of this workstream should be enough to justify the budget. The workflow, efficiency, inclusiveness and the crucial role that it plays in the future of DAO, the protocol and the impact it has on the future of PG makes this a clear YES(small GTC hodler though, others may disagree).</p>

            <p>I am supportive of this budget, the sheer volume of work MMM has underway is inspiring and the recent “takeover” of the weekly stand up indicated to me there is plenty of substance being developed.  In a prior life I worked for what was essentially a marketing company and the rigor I see starting to be developed reverberates with brand building frameworks I am used to, but at a much price point and eons faster.</p>
<p>Via back and forth in Discord, MMM has helped me understand their work and budget.  As we move into and past season 16, I will be looking for these things:</p>
<ul>
<li>How Season 16 was transformative from a community perspective</li>
<li>Brand strategies (community, passport, Grants)</li>
<li>Grants program impact report &lt;&lt;&lt; this is going to be great<br>
Additionally, in successive seasons, I will be looking to see how we align GPC goals with MMM work.<br>
Last point, there is a lot of planned work and ideally MMM nails it on all fronts.  But.  It might be good to think about what may have to be stopped to free up capacity for higher order priorities.</li>

            <p>Thank you for this detailed budget! It’s great to see progress made since S15 and learn more about the direction MMM is headed in. I was curious about organizing it by headcount (a question I know was brought up in one of the most recent MMM meetings), but outside of the overall organizing structure, I think think the allotments suggested make sense. I’m in support!</p>

            <p>Great question, Sabrina.</p>
<p>S14 was the first time we ran them. I think they only went OK - there was a major focus on showing each other appreciation vs. creating a culture of high performance. I think this is because our culture at the time wasn’t as open to receiving that kind of feedback.</p>
<p>In this past season (S15) we ran a session with less of a focus on appreciation (which we have a ritual of doing each week at our Weekly Sync) and more on creating commitments to high performance. Not only was the feedback given/received by everyone more impactful, our group session gave everyone the opportunity to share learnings and insights from their feedback and to create public commitments about what they are going to strive for next season.</p>
<p>The main gap I see from last season that we will look to rectify this season is creating clear accountability around those commitments (by writing them down somewhere and tracking how they performed against those commitments).</p>
<p>If you (or anyone else) have ideas on running effective peer/performance reviews, please post them below or send me a DM in Discord (CoachJ#0481) - would love to learn how to improve our process!</p>

<p>I would say this is mostly accurate. We are still finalizing some details but TL;DR related to what you highlighted:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are doing a lot of building and marketing of our protocols in the background, in anticipation of a heavy marketing play in S17</li>
<li>We are not 100% sure if we plan to marketing three distinct protocols vs. two (Passport and Grants). We are still determining what the best course of action is to ensure that our messaging is clear and accurate for our different audiences.</li>
<li>Transitiong our grants program from cGrants to Protocol - 100% correct. Everyone should see a comms plan circulating internally in the next week or two.</li>

            <p>Hi Laura and Jonathan -</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience with me.  I thought unpacking the areas of potential quantifiable progress were particularly valuable; I also learned quite a bit about our approaches to DevRel and about the overall operating context of building MMM while shifting our focus as a DAO.  Thank you for taking the time to educate me and other Stewards.</p>
<p>On the whole - at the risk of being a lonely voice in the wilderness - I think we should consider whether the DAO is leaning forward too aggressively given unavoidable risks.</p>

            <p>Thanks for sharing – and great list of S15 wins. A lot to celebrate! I want to specifically echo the cross-workstream partnerships &amp; clearer lines of communications between different workstreams – that was such a huge shift in S15 that will set the DAO up so much better heading into protocol launch, kudos to MMM for leading much of that DAO-wide.</p>
<p>Overall I echo others’ sentiments that the proposal is solid and the magnitude &amp; increase of budget is reasonable, given the net new areas MMM is absorbing this season.</p>
<p>Just one point of feedback on the proposal – the “top priorities” listed in the TL;DR don’t <em>quite</em> map to the S16 goals… I found myself a little disoriented flipping back &amp; forth and trying to reconcile them (e.g., the first bullet in the TL;DR talks about GR16 communications as a focus, whereas under goals the point around “Program” minimizes the effort of that area). I appreciate the clear “protocol/program” even/over articulation, but when I look at the objectives under programs, there is a LOT still there. No specific question – just sharing those observations for the team’s consideration.</p>

            <p>I am supportive of this budget, and have been so excited for the work MMM is doing. It feels like so much of our marketing, our protocol understanding and our community engagement is starting to take shape.</p>
<p>Having Schelling Point this season (which was outside of this budget as <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/pop">@Pop</a> lead this work) always brings such great energy, marketing and excitement. I am really pumped to see that there may be more collaboration between the SP team, and the MMM team as well.</p>
<p>I want to summarize some of my understanding for the work ahead - this is the first season we will be really building and marketing three distinct protocols, at the same time we are transitioning our grants program from cGrants to Protocol (which reduces the marketing burden of “running a round” but increases the burden in our general website, and brand positioning and understanding). Does that seem accurate?</p>
<p>Overall, I really appreciate the thoughtful approach, growing the budget and team in a way that is still manageable and prudent, and then also scoping projects with clear deliverables.</p>

[S16 Proposal - INTEGRATED] MMM Budget Request
CoachJonathan

            <h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>In Season 16, MMM will continue to focus on providing support for the Grants Protocol launch, the Grants Program Success and Community Engagement. To do so, we are requesting a budget of $471,949.</p>
<p>Our top priorities for this season include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finalize overall Gitcoin, protocol, Passport and Grants Program branding strategies</li>
<li>Launch (or make significant headway in launching) a new <a href="http://gitcoin.co" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">gitcoin.co</a> website</li>
<li>Developing and socializing communications around GR16, the sunsetting of the centralized grants platform (cGrants) and our transition to the protocol</li>
<li>Developing and releasing an Impact Report to highlight the success of the Gitcoin Grants Program</li>
<li>Develop and test an engagement strategy that targets three core community audiences (which were identified and researched in S15)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Amount</strong></p>
<p>MMM’s S16 budget is $471,949 (+13% vs S15 budget of $417,543). After accounting for remaining budget &amp; reserves, MMM is requesting $686,239 for Season 16 from the treasury.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for a 13% increase in our budget. Listed below are initiatives that we are newly taking on in an effort to prepare ourselves for a successful launch of our Grants Protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li>Absorption of the grassroots initiative</li>
<li>Building and launching a new <a href="http://Gitcoin.co" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Gitcoin.co</a> website [a new initiative]</li>
<li>Development of more robust strategies around partnerships, influencer marketing and PR &amp; Comms</li>
<li>Integration of Schelling Point event from a brand &amp; creative standpoint</li>
<li>Visual refresh of the Gitcoin brand, Grants Program and Grants Protocol</li>
<li>Increased efforts to market Passport</li>
<li>UNICEF round promotion</li>
</ul>

<a name="milestone-report-1" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#milestone-report-1"></a>Milestone Report</h1>
<p>All in all, MMM performed well in terms of tracking to S15 OKRs. There were many changing priorities over the course of the season which resulted in a lot of <img src="/uploads/db4391/original/2X/5/56640aa3f228a1fbaa639d511f4876b38b0135aa.png" alt=":black_circle:" title=":black_circle:" data-base62-sha1="ckfoPBq8PWwU9bdhjTeaLRb55J8" width="20" height="20">. This likely had to do with a change in leadership at MMM and a lack of context on what the DAO needed at the time of budgeting. There were also several <img src="/uploads/db4391/original/2X/3/34d53047d2ed6715cb6faba356739ffac859e183.png" alt=":red_circle:" title=":red_circle:" data-base62-sha1="7xnA8L1w6Ey9gzsttgy4zJRSGNZ" width="20" height="20"> that mostly had to do with metrics that were mostly out of MMM’s control. This is a great learning for the team to set OKRs directly related to outputs within our control.</p>

<a name="s16-goals-3" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#s16-goals-3"></a>S16 Goals</h1>
<p>The outcomes below lack metrics compared to last season. The reason for this is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Protocols - over the next 3 months, the Grants Protocol and Passport are still in early stages of development and are not driving toward any particular metrics. As such, MMM will abstain from setting any unnecessary metrics-driven goals.</li>
<li>Program - since we will be running a small Grants Round with minimal promotional effort, we will mostly be focused on executing according to requests from the PGF team while monitoring existing benchmarks on Twitter and through email.</li>
<li>Research-backed content - this season, our content team is going to be wholly focused on experimenting with different channels and types of content, playing with headlines, formats, etc. in order to better understand our audiences and their needs come S17. Our main focus this season is on running experiments, measuring and running more experiments. With our learnings, we will be prepared come S17 to create high impact, desirable content for our audiences.</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally, MMM is focused on Protocols delivery even/over Program delivery. That said, we always strive to deliver 100% on all fronts.</p>
