[S15 Proposal - INTEGRATED] FDD Budget Request
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s15-proposal-integrated-fdd-budget-request/11224
    This is the integrated funding proposal for the Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD) Workstream requesting funding for Season 15 (1 August 2022 through 31 October 2022).
# Essential Intents

In S15, FDD has components of our work that focus on all four of the DAO's Essential Intents - though our priorities will be on the following EIs in the given order:

* Grant Program Success
* Protocol Adoption
* DAO Organization & Financial Sustainability

More Information on the Essential Intents can be found in this [post](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/update-gitcoindaos-adopted-purpose-and-essential-intents/10984).

# TL;DR

In Season 15, FDD aims to provide the Gitcoin community with the knowledge that matching funds are allocated as optimally as possible within the given set of assumptions and constraints. One focus will be operationally executing the fraud detection & defense needs of the Gitcoin main/Ethereum round & any other community moderated rounds. The second is assisting Gitcoin Product Collective with operational insights, quantitative analysis, and algorithmic/mechanism design research. 

**Based on what we learned in Season 14**, we will improve our communication during the season to remove confusion regarding FDD priorities, purpose, and alignment with GitcoinDAO.

> 💡For more context regarding our vision, the current state of FDD and more please refer to the [📄supplement document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1727t0mGF8GxndFwcUH8b04ct3ACWRRqufSTrQ0bAMOE/edit?usp=sharing).

# Amount

FDD is requesting **$349,500**. This budget does not include the additional 60 days of reserves. Breakdown of the budget per budget category and initiative can be found at the end.

|Gitcoin Season|Season 15|Season 14|Season 13|
|---|---|---|---|
|FDD Season Budget|$349,500|$330,000|$596,295|
|FDD Season Reserves|$233,000|$220,000|$596,295|
|Unspent Reserves % ***1)***|100%|100%|100%|
|Treasury Request ***2)***|$362,500|$281,041|$879,590|

***1)** The amount of GTC requested and the value of the reserves will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally using the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average, whichever is lower.*

***2)** The Season 15 treasury request amount is an estimate using the price of $2.99 GTC to calculate the total of the reserves rolled over from Season 14.*

<p>Hmm, can you detail more please? We are always looking for feedback and if we can improve in any way I would love to hear your opinions <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12" title=":sparkles:" class="emoji" alt=":sparkles:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>FYI. The main obstacle of GE has been the fact that the rounds were coupled and we had to “balance” everything as objectively as we could(from a review, appeal, dispute standpoint + the fact that we had to “filter” through a lot of old grants that started to game the system + the grant investigations which are “complex” at times to say the least).</p>
<p>All of this + the big DAO shifts = FDD love <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/rofl.png?v=12" title=":rofl:" class="emoji" alt=":rofl:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/blue_heart.png?v=12" title=":blue_heart:" class="emoji" alt=":blue_heart:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

</aside>
<p>We will surely continue and improve coordination on those areas, it will not be a simple task, but we will again have even more observations/insights/data that will allow us to better define how we should approach this. In a protocol future ideally policy should  be just an “update” and maybe also a crowdsourced/community one.</p>

            <p>I echo others’ feedback on this proposal and will be voting yes.</p>
<p>FDD has come leaps &amp; bounds since even last season on its communication of the budget. The simplicity and clarity of this request is a breath of fresh air and one that other workstreams (mine included!) can learn from.</p>
<p>I hope for two things for FDD for S15:</p>
<ul>
<li>To continue this simplification/communication effort, in all its other facets beyond just the budget (IMO the FDD Discord norms, team structures, and often the slides/visuals shared are still often hard-to-understand and slightly overwhelming)</li>
<li>To continue to increase collaboration with PGF as we look to jointly define how we manage policy &amp; eligibility in a protocol world</li>

            <p>I’ve followed FDD’s budget ever since FDD was first formed and I found that reading this current iteration was a breeze. So kudos to the team!</p>
<p><strong>Good</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>great job for S14, executing on everything and even going the extra mile with lowering the cost of reviews</li>
<li>liked how y’all engaged <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/epowell101">@epowell101</a> and gave them a warm welcome to Gitcoin’s governance forum and process</li>
<li>liked how you involved some of your reviewers! Thank you for your service <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/annanna96">@AnnAnna96</a> ( I see a fellow person born in '96) and <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/romeonebun">@romeonebun</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Could improve</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>would really like to see FDD take on some thought leadership about its data operations. What is being done here is truly unique and could definitely benefit the ecosystem at large</li>
<li>I think during one of our calls we reframed FDD’s role as ensuring efficient capital allocation. I hope to see more of this in your thinking about FDD’s value not just within Gitcoin but to the ecosystem at large especially when looking at the future of Gitcoin as a protocol</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Looking forward</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>we’re working on grantee engagement next season over at PGF and grantees always tend to have issues about reviews, appeals etc. Looking forward to improving this user experience!</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, thank you for your hard work and forward to S15</p>

            <p>Amazing to see that the FDD budget request is getting good feedback. As a random web3 dude, grant reviewing was an amazing experience and I was just happy to use the skills I developed when investing in crypto to help allocate matching. It felt that we had an impact overall, I was a little confused when I heard that we could no longer continue reviewing. I was one of the newest reviewers, but people like <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/annanna96">@AnnAnna96</a> <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ijeblowrider">@ijeblowrider</a> emmanuel were really working hard and when comparing the result with their review it seemed that their reviews were accurate <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p>I will echo the appreciation and sentiment on the clarity of the budget and clear division of work across the four key areas.</p>
<p>I know there are already conversations happening around how might we further embed some of the work FDD is doing with other teams (PGF, Passport dev, etc.) and I love the idea of exploring this as part of S15. Specifically to make sure collaboration is strong and we are focused on the protocol future.</p>
<p>I am supportive of the budget as proposed. I think throughout S15 I would want to confirm ownership of specific areas are well defined (ie, where Grants review lives, where protocol research lives). This could leave more room in the FDD mandate to support data research, data access and developing integration with other tools (perhaps aura).</p>
<p>Thanks again for the work to get us to this point!</p>

            <p>Hello, <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/tigress">@tigress</a> I’m glad to see the FDD budget posted here<br>
First I just wanna say I love to be a grant reviewer and part of the FDD and Gitcoin. The vibes are awesome, I love to catch bad projects, bad actors/ sybils <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/blue_heart.png?v=12" title=":blue_heart:" class="emoji" alt=":blue_heart:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"><br>
One aspect I really don’t understand is why we got so much push back on grant reviews when we were very effective as a group and managed to protect Gitcoin for 4 seasons. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/innocent.png?v=12" title=":innocent:" class="emoji" alt=":innocent:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"><br>
I agree that maybe we should have been more proactive or maybe more involved in the DAO as a whole, but we are still here <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/100.png?v=12" title=":100:" class="emoji" alt=":100:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>Our current answer is:  We highlight that FDD is aiming to protocolize solutions, not to be a services company of any sort. That said, there are definitely avenues for monetization including spinning out a service DAO or even building and owning digital public infrastructure for sharing data, feature and model engineering for ML, and crowdsourcing data science insights.</p>
<p>However, one could argue and ask: why does protocolizing seem to be at odds with generating revenue? Which one applies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Revenue XOR Protocolizing</li>
<li>Revenue OR Protocolizing</li>
</ol>
<p>The need is for buy in from the rest of the DAO and stewards to give us the freedom to discover where the value is.</p>
<p>To make that happen, the stewards community would have to reconsider their decision, because they voted DOWN a discovery for a revenue-generating sybil detection DAO. We understood that the driver behind this decision was continually viewing attempts of revenue generation as “defecting”.</p>

</aside>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/disruptionjoe">@DisruptionJoe</a> has been leading most of alignment conversions and he outlines:</p>
<p>One area is our work toward solutions which decentralize the moderation inputs to a grant round. User and grant moderation is one of our core competencies. Our bottoms up suggestions all recommend that we build digital public infrastructure to sustainably serve these needs in a credibly neutral way that is equally accessible to all the communities that will run their own rounds in the future.</p>
<p>The stewards, guided by a few strong opinions, however, have pushed us to centralize our efforts for efficiency and simply execute until a time when the other workstreams can design protocol-based solutions. One of our strengths is Protocol Research. We believe our research could be much better utilized to align roadmaps and context awareness across the DAO.</p>
<p>Here are some hands-on examples:<br>
Example 1 - Using Ethelo for scaling grant reviews<br>
Example 2 - Discovery for Sybil Detection DAO<br>
Example 3 - Shutting down the community model only to be wowed by a presentation of on-chain features.</p>
<p>And …</p>
<p>The best example - We couldn’t get our contributors’ Data Access to cGrants database until last season for all but Blockscience. We couldn’t tinker with data to improve rounds over rounds.</p>
<p>So then we literally moved the whole SAD model to be run by the DAO with no way to get or check data other than requesting it from Blockscience and scraping it. (We didn’t have any access to data prior to season 14.)</p>

<p>For the record, we have been pushing to get a definition of the term core contributors at CSDO. How do you see the other streams defining it differently?</p>
<p>Currently, the 8 core contributors listed can be compared to a full time salary.</p>
<p>The trusted contributors are hourly ranging from $20/hr to $75 hr.</p>

<p>Thanks! I can confirm this is an accurate update of the 8 core contributors for FDD.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the feedback regarding the visual. Every S15 budget proposal follow a structure that takes care of the broader strokes, but there are still a couple of differences when you really dig into the details. FDD for example does not present a list of full time and part time contributors so that information can’t be added to this visual at this time. Also a bit tricky as WS use the term “core contributors” differently. I hope we can get some unifying rules in place for the non-draft budget proposals.</p>

            <p>This budget is by far the best (i.e. most easily understood) budget I’ve seen and I’ve been looking for a long time. Huge thanks to everyone involved.</p>
<p>The info-graphic is amazing. Thanks so much for that.</p>
<p>Request: Can you include the number of full and part time contributors on the info-graphic as this would allow me to do a quick estimate of per hour rates, which, while perhaps somewhat distasteful, are undeniably useful from a “reasonableness” perspective.</p>
<p>Those numbers appear in the budget doc, but can they be added to the info-graphic? Is the list of contributors at the bottom complete (there are seven)? Is that indicative of the number of contributors?</p>
