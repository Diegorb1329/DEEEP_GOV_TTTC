Introducing Stewards Governance
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-stewards-governance/41
    Over the last [two](https://gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-grants-round-8-governance-brief/) [rounds](https://gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-grants-round-9-governance-brief/) of Gitcoin Grants, we've brought in a number of grantees and contributors in the community to help us think about how to better fund digital public goods and serve the web3 community, whether by stopping [sybil attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack), improving grants discoverability, or more precisely defining the kinds of [public goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)) that can be funded.

Through those conversations, we've learned a lot about what we're doing well, and what we could improve on. One comment that came up frequently was that although we regularly seek feedback from community members and strive to be credibly neutral, we’ve historically had the final say in how Gitcoin Grants operates and have a decent amount of centralization debt. 

Now, we want to pay down that debt, and empower the community to govern and to act. 

**What are stewards? :thinking:**

With that in mind, I'm excited to propose the creation of a new stewards program as the first (hopefully of many) meta-governance proposals. While we want the community to have the final say in even what stewardship means, here are a few key areas we've identified that we need support from the previous roundtables we've held:

* Setting grants round categories and sizes (how much funding should go to a matching pool for core infrastructure as compared to community or media?)
* Determining what kinds of public goods we care about (e.g. is an open source project with VC funding still a public good?)
* Defining what kind of behavior counts as a sybil-attack or collusion (when is collusion just squads vibing) 
* Finding credibly neutral ways to display grantees so that everyone has an equal shot at being funded 

How do you know if this is right for you? If the problems above sound interesting, and you care deeply about finding better solutions to fund our digital infrastructure, you're in! That said, being a steward will definitely take some time, and you should probably be prepared to block off at least an hour out of your week (4-6 hours a month) to sync with other stewards and check out what's new as this forum grows. 

Here are a few of the other duties / workstreams we think stewards might want to consider based on some of the problems we face (synthesizing the areas we identified above):

**Meta-Governance:** How we define organizational processes for Gitcoin with the community

**Public Goods Funding:** Helping rally the community to fund public goods, setting criteria for matching rounds, and finding ways to get Gitcoin involved in funding new digital public goods we might have missed

**Anti-Fraud and Collusion Detection:** Analyzing Gitcoin data and brainstorming long-term identity and mechanism design solutions for Sybil-Resistance

**Progressive Decentralization:** Finding ways to modularize and simplify Gitcoin’s architecture for the community to use in perpetuity

**Special Projects:** Finding ways to use Gitcoin’s new architecture to build interesting / novel solutions around public goods funding

These are just ideas, this post is a first step and we have many more to take. If you have any other ideas for these kinds of workstreams feel free to suggest them as a thread in the governance-meta category!

<strong>Statement of Intention / Your Values &amp; Reasons for Joining:</strong></p>
<p>My journey began with hands-on agroecological practices, where I designed and managed agroforestry systems focused on biodiversity restoration, soil health improvement, and sustainable livelihoods. This foundation was the driving force behind my work with <strong>GreenPill Brasil</strong>, where I built a community dedicated to integrating agroecology with Web3 technologies. Through GreenPill Brasil, I have facilitated workshops and sessions on decentralized governance, regenerative finance, web3 paradigms, carbon and biodiversity credits, equipping new local actors with the tools to scale their impact while ensuring environmental and financial sustainability.</p>
<p>With <strong>Dev Guild</strong>, I expanded these efforts by contributing to product development and operational frameworks that bridge ecological initiatives with blockchain innovations. My work on the <strong>GreenGoods app</strong>, for example, focuses on creating systems to document and reward biodiversity efforts, such as reforestation and native bee conservation, using hypercerts and on-chain validation. This app emerged from my commitment to providing scalable tools that empower grassroots movements while fostering global collaboration.</p>
<p>Through these roles, I have not only supported agroecological restoration but also brought decentralized funding mechanisms like quadratic funding into alignment with local projects. This integration ensures that communities benefit directly from global funding opportunities, reinforcing transparency and accountability in the process. My technical research with <strong>Silvi Protocol</strong> and Treekipedia further complements this mission by developing open-source tools that track and validate ecological restoration efforts, creating frameworks that are accessible and impactful for stakeholders worldwide. As part of the <strong>Allo Yeeter</strong> team, I contributed to creating a tool designed to streamline and optimize the funding allocation process, ensuring transparency, efficiency, and scalability. This experience allowed me to engage deeply with Allo mechanics, so im very excited to research the design space of decentralized funding allocation, while addressing the practical needs of grassroots communities and regenerative projects.</p>
<p>I see Gitcoin and the Allo Protocol as a unique and powerful combination for building decentralized algorithms that can truly transform how we fund public goods. As someone deeply rooted in agroecology, I believe the principles of agroecology can provide a foundational set of regenerative values, like systems thinking, diversity, resilience, sovereignty and equitable resource distribution. By integrating these principles, we can create funding mechanisms and finance structures that doesn’t exist yet.</p>

<strong>Statement of Intention / Your Values &amp; Reasons for Joining:</strong><br>
I believe blockchain, Web3 and decentralized finance form a vital element of our society’s transition to a more just, inclusive, equitable and resilient world.</p>
<p>I am particularly bullish on the capacity for these technologies to reduce inequality by removing intermediaries from the financial system and realign incentives by “funding what matters.”</p>
<p>Following on that conviction, I am excited about the nascent regenerative finance movement’s thesis that impact is valuable and decentralized finance technology can be used to increase efficiency, transparency and equitability in the impact world.</p>
<p>GitCoin forms a key part of the ReFi ecosystem and I would be honored to be part of the organization’s governance, stemming especially from my desire to see the nonprofit/philanthropic world evolve into something capable of re-shaping the economy and society instead of reinforcing unequal, counter-productive structures underlying capitalism.</p>
<p>Basically I think Web3 will help us form a parallel, regenerative society and GitCoin is a keystone in that process, and I feel called to help out however I can.</p>
<p><strong>Your Web3 Qualifications / Skills:</strong><br>
I founded the Center for Collaborative Economics, a blockchain-first organization dedicated to building infrastructure to facilitate impact, by helping nonprofits, social entrepreneurs, foundations and mutual aid organizations fund and track their impact on-chain using Web3 technologies. My role as founder falls somewhere between project manager, community liason, and business development.<br>
Look for our multi-chain donation and impact certification platform, coming soon.</p>
<p>I’m a proud member of the GreenPill Dev Guild as well as an active member in other web3 impact/ReFi communities.</p>
<p>In my day job, I run a mutual aid public health organization serving people who use drugs, named Dubuque Harm Reduction.</p>
<p>My experience in the nonprofit-industrial complex has given me first-hand experience with how broken the system is- misaligned incentives, poorly-allocated funding, nepotism, corruption- and I believe Web3 tools like GitCoin hold the key to unlocking the potential contained within the system, by empowering the people and smaller community organizations who have been left out in the cold, while immense amounts of funding flow to the larger and more well-connected organizations.</p>
<p>On the flip-side, my nonprofit experience has given me skills and connections which would be helpful to Gitcoin, including experience with grant writing and administration, and I am fluent in bureaucrat-ese- I’m happy to serve as “nonprofit whisperer.”</p>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong><br>
We are a team of dedicated governance enthusiasts who have been in the governance space for over four years. Our team were some of the first members involved in defi governance and we want to apply what we have learned over the years to Gitcoin. We recently partook in GG20 grants as part of the governance ecosystem delegates initiative and are looking to become more active in the community!</p>
<p><strong>Core Values:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Growth: Our decisions are primarily focused on the growth of the protocol. This often results in how to spend money efficiently, but even more importantly and objecting for unreasonable spends and knowing when to vote no.</li>
<li>Transparency: Clear communication with votes and explanations of reasoning, and an equivalent demand for proposals to do the same. Too often we see thousands, if not millions, being rolled up together and glossed over during proposals.</li>
<li>Accountability: Too often once a decision is done, having proper accountability becomes an afterthought. Whether it’s a DAO promise or a grant or a new program, once a DAO votes something in, we forget about it. Our goal with PGov is to both continue to check in on these decisions as well as ensure that there are proper channels set up to ensure accountability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conflicts of Interest:</strong><br>
If situations arise, we will abstain from a vote, and clearly state the conflict on the forums.</p>

<p><strong>Statement of Intention / Your Values &amp; Reasons for Joining:</strong> A little late to the Steward party but my name is Jess and I have been a contributor since February 2024 as Operations Manager! To be fair, it took me some time to get fully integrated and understand my role as a Steward so now I can confidently say I am excited to be here to help move Gitcoin in the right direction. I am a regen at heart and think blockchain is the solution to transparency in <em>basically</em> any industry. Gitcoin has long enabled incredible projects to flourish outside of traditional funding. Being apart of something bigger than myself and identifying key areas of improvement within society is the root of my intention. Luckily, my fellow Gitcoiners have a similar focus and I am so thrilled to see what the future holds because of it!</p>
<p><strong>Your Web3 Qualifications / Skills:</strong> I have been in web3 since the 2019 bullrun but aside from “number go up”, was all too interested in the projects behind the token. After a long long stint in the music industry (corporate and as an artist), I became hyperfixated on this new era in technology. Self-sovereignty should be at the forefront of all of our minds in this day and age. I did the DeFi, GameFi thing for a bit but needed way more purpose in my day-to-day. I build new revenue streams for impact projects and make shitty house music in my spare time. <strong>TLDR</strong>: If we are not making the world a better place, what’s the point?</p>

<p><strong>Statement of Intention / Your Values &amp; Reasons for Joining</strong><br>
I have been an active contributor to Gitcoin since 2022 and believe in a multi-mechanism future that enables communities to fund what matters to them. So, as I’ve been a contributor for two years I want to take the next step as a steward to do what I can to give more back to Gitcoin and the community - and to do anything I can to help make the Gitcoin ecosystem more successful over time.</p>
<p><strong>Qualifications /skills</strong><br>
I’ve been in web3 since 2022, enjoy learning new things, examining ideas and ways forward, and solving problems. Prior to web3, I had a background in management operations, but I’m here for the coordination.</p>

<p><strong>Statement of Intention / My Values &amp; Reason for Joining:</strong></p>
<p>I am an independent researcher, and a generalist. I have been an open source proponent in the domains, and interstices thereof, of finance, education, civilizational grade networking tools, artificial intelligence and long-term archives for more than a decade; and, been actively participating at the junction of decentralized open financial systems, art markets, and emergent governance praxes practically, thanks to primarily the Ethereum ecosystem, both as an individual and in collectives.</p>
<p>I value professionalism, accountability, and honesty when it comes to the so-called sweat equity across the web3 cultural clusters. I’ve always donated to projects that align with my version of a probable future for our collective betterment, and observed from afar.</p>
<p>However, the more I started to partake in real life events that are primarily driven thanks to public goods funding, if not good samaritans, the clearer it has become for me that not all good actors are professional, let alone accountable—which in turn obliges me to go for becoming of a steward.</p>
<p>These are merely the tip of the mountain of a personal reasoning.</p>
<p><strong>What Qualifications / Skills I Have:</strong></p>
<p>I am an autodidact generalist who is able to use almost any production suite but I am aware that you are not looking for another marketer. I have a background in conflict resolution focused NGOs, academic lecturing—literary/ languages—, and marketing with a focus on growth and media planning. I have been using the best of these for my individual success onchain for half a decade now. I can state that I am good at coordination, community-steering—since a community is a cybernetics issue for me, viral yet meaningful campaigns. Though this should have been added in the above section, I perceive my accountability, professionalism and punctuality as skills, too. That is, I make sure everything clearly conveyed and upheld. I also specialize in archives so I make sure nothing is lost forever.</p>

<p><strong>Discord Handle</strong>: cryptoreumd</p>
<p><strong>Statement of Intention / Your Values &amp; Reasons for Joining:</strong><br>
You can find me in many places under the nickname CryptoReuMD. First a little bit about me. I’ve been in crypto for 3 years, my story starts with the intention of decentralization of ideas and science is for me a lifetime of knowledge which has to be put on a chain and validated peer to peer, which led me to understand the real problems facing crypto, plutocracy, hegemony and many other coordination failures, being my priority to start in a DAO.<br>
My first steps were as part of the translations of the content of BanklessDAO, I ventured to know a little more by being part of the Advocates of The Graph, but my technical knowledge was not so robust and unilateral coordination did not seem attractive to me, likewise I tried it in Optimism and Arbitrum, denoting still much seed of power focused on liquidity and economic power.<br>
After a few years, BanklessDAO grew much more and we launched Nacion Bankless, a subDAO that is currently a reference in Latin America for content and decentralization, where we managed to push the decentralization ethos that I was looking for.</p>
<p><strong>Web 3 Qualification/Skills</strong><br>
My first rounds in Gitcoin were as Grantee, at first with Ethereum Mexico and later with Nación Bankless, initially learning how to create the proposal and then the grant coordination mechanisms.<br>
After two sessions, particularly the 18th and 19th, it was for me a great opportunity, since I got to know the possibilities of helping each other and how Gitcoin, unlike other projects, even if they are also in charge of donations and community-based capital raising, still lives hurt by the votes of a few people and simply the grantees repeat themselves, without updates, without reports of success and the use of the funds raised.<br>
Because of this situation, as part of the transparency of our subDAO we are dedicated to publish each of our successes and experiences, with a breakdown of incentives and the portfolios of those who receive those funds, with a method of transparency that we will continue to implement, you can find these reports in the forums of Gticoin, Arbitrum, BanklessDAO, Optimism and Push, since we consider that we must always have a proof of work in this game economy.<br>
Together with several of my colleagues and with a lot of support from the community I managed to create the first rounds for Mexico and for projects that create improvements in the reporting chains of the projects that live off chain, raising 10, 000 USD between the two rounds, a success that is not only mine and I owe it 100% to the community.</p>
<p><strong>Current challenges</strong></p>
<p>Today I consider that GItcoin has an ecosystem that has gradually learned to decentralize, adopting more innovative governance schemes and also maturing in terms of resistance to Sybill attacks and liquidity extraction, a fact that for me has been fascinating, however The content is still mostly in English and the Latin American projects are simply repeated, many of them do not even update their proposals, they just upload them again and the successes they may have are not reflected.</p>
<p>Likewise, I think we have a content war where basically we all create the most vibrant video, the most elegant tweet and the most curious meme, but it remains the same and repetitive, we have not managed to link our ideas and support the projects, This, although we can understand it as part of the tragedy of the commons.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the funding currently seen in Latin America is nothing compared to what is received in other parts of the world, which generates a certain gentrification of resources and therefore reduces the success of our colleagues.</p>
<p><strong>How do I plan to work my delegation?</strong></p>
<p>When the idea of being a delegate of any project came to me, my response was with reservation, however when reading this opportunity, I simply could not say no, I feel that a way to live decentralization and the teaching of the ImpactDAO and Green books Pill is essentially acting in the governance of Gitcoin, I consider now to be much more transparent and help in the way possible so that my colleagues and of course a server do not miss the opportunities to continue growing, always with the intention of helping and generate waves of support among everyone.</p>
<p>For me the most important thing is the community, although many times we benefit from the votes in the rounds, it is essential for me to keep my words firm and if I consider that governance is important, having protocol tokens as a shield to Subsequent decisions is one of my greatest feats, given that with everything and what comes, delegation is more important than the extraction of liquidity.</p>
<p>Sharing, in essence, is something fascinating, it is not about giving gifts, but about giving people what they deserve for their work and monitoring in a simple and fair way what we are all doing, I believe that it is time for the governance and that DAOs once again lead the narrative, just before the explosion of users and everything gets out of control, which is why I will be more present in the forum and discussing progress and updates.</p>
<p>Although there is a lot of content in Spanish, there are few of us who check it all out and most of these training videos tend to be weak and with few views, so no matter who produces the content, I will make sure it is seen so that we can understand it from different perspectives, as long as it is content with the intention of helping and not just benefiting the protocol or the people who have uploaded it.</p>
<p>At Nacion Bankless we created a coordination section, in which we are delegates of different projects, Push, Optimism, Arbitrum and now Gitcoin, having a little more knowledge of what happens in other projects will allow us to more easily understand governance and take concrete decisions.</p>
<p>Creation of a decision reporting channel with justification. I believe that Hypercertz and Attestations are primitives that we should use, although the governance is intuitive and always forward, the forums are modifiable, so I consider that the decisions should be engraved in stone, so it is best to publish those decisions as attestations.</p>
<p>Impartiality will be one of the great differences and challenges that I will have, I have seen in governance forums the balance tip for a few people and fundraising to enrich projects even within my country, so I consider it a priority to be on the edge of these decisions and have a greater impact on people who are barely developing.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives to be reported</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Number of quality hours in which I do the work of reading and posting on the forum</li>
<li>Number of posts, whether as threads, tweets, videos or any type of content explaining about governance</li>
<li>Thread in the forum with decisions and attestations about what is discussed in governance</li>
<li>Number of new projects boarded to Gitcoin</li>
<li>Number of meetings, talks or webinars about Gitcoin.</li>
<li>Number of projects existing in previous rounds that begin to report their progress in the forum and with chain evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>These will be the scoop, I will evaluate how many I can actually do so that in future sections of the quarters, I can estimate a number of them.</p>
