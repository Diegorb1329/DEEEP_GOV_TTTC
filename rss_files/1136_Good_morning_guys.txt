Good morning guys,

            <p>You are most welcome here,the goal here is not really to earn gtc tokens. They are deemed not to be of economic value (although they are listed on exchanges),they are designed to be governance tokens for decisions on the community activities. The community is geared towards promoting the development of Open Source or ‚ÄúCommon Good‚Äù projects through quadratic finding. The airdrops are just an afterthought by some successful projects(yes,they are nice,who doesn‚Äôt like some perks) Let‚Äôs focus on building</p>
