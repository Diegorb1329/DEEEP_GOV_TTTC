https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-treasury-diversification/9698
    **Authors from [Llama](https://llama.xyz/):** @schlabach, @0xJosh, @helloshreyas

**Summary**

We propose that Gitcoin diversify $15 million of its treasury into stablecoins. $15m constitutes 24% of the vested treasury and 2% of the total treasury (vested + unvested). The goals of the treasury diversification are to de-risk Gitcoin’s treasury, make sure the treasury has sufficient stablecoins to cover one year of operating expenses, and ensure that GTC tokens are held by long-term partners. This post outlines the need and process for the treasury diversification. We are also seeking members to fill four spots in a treasury diversification working group. Please respond to this post if you are interested!

**Need for Stablecoins in the Gitcoin Treasury**

As of January 13, Gitcoin’s [treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x57a8865cfb1ecef7253c27da6b4bc3daee5be518) stood at $62 million, 99% of which was held in GTC tokens. Gitcoin’s [treasury vester wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x44aa9c5a034c1499ec27906e2d427b704b567ffe) contains $543 million worth of GTC tokens. Additionally, working group wallets contain a small amount of DAI used to pay contributors.

Gitcoin’s operating budget has grown significantly since the launch of the DAO and is now approximately $3-4 million per quarter. This budget is used to fund the FDD working group, Moonshot Collective, Gitcoin’s public goods effort, marketing expenses, Gitcoin decentralization efforts, and the DAO Ops workstream. More details on Gitcoin’s spending can be seen in Llama’s [monthly financial statements for the DAO](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-financial-reporting/8867). (s/o to @Elliott) 

At the same time, Gitcoin’s governance token continues to be volatile. From September 28 to November 27, the price of GTC rose from $6.30 to $28.04, more than quadrupling. Since its high in late November, the token has fallen and now trades around $11.75. This volatility in price affects Gitcoin’s treasury and makes it difficult to forecast and address future spending.

Gitcoin’s annual operating budget ($15m) currently constitutes 24% of the vested treasury. If GTC’s price falls by 50%, Gitcoin’s treasury will also decrease by 50%, which would make it difficult to meet or increase operating expenses. Gitcoin’s growth should not be hampered by short term swings in its token price. **Gitcoin should have at least 1 year of operating expenses in stablecoins so that it has clarity on its budget and is able to comfortably pay its contributors.**

Additionally, paying contributors in GTC could put downward pressure on the price of the GTC token. Contributors may choose to sell their tokens at a later date, pushing the price of GTC down.

Diversifying a portion of Gitcoin’s treasury will give the following benefits:

* De-risk the Gitcoin treasury and lower its volatility
* Allow Gitcoin workstreams and contributors the option to get paid in stables if they choose
* Allow Gitcoin to operate from a position of strength in case of a market downturn
* Lower operational costs required to sell GTC for stables each quarter in order to pay contributors
* Ensure that GTC tokens are held by long-term partners

**Proposal**

Given the rationale outlined above, we propose that the Gitcoin treasury exchange $15m in GTC for USDC or DAI to strategic partners and individuals chosen by the community. In order to carry out this diversification of the Gitcoin treasury, we propose the following process as an actionable roadmap:

1. Form a 5-person working group from the DAO to work on the plan for diversifying the Gitcoin treasury.
2. Draft a comprehensive governance forum post, detailing the logistics of the diversification of the Gitcoin treasury and the types of strategic partners desired. Additionally, it will explain how potential strategic partners should express their interest via a response to the forum post.
3. Vet strategic partners based on select criteria established by the DAO and ask these partners to speak to the community (on a platform such as Discord or Twitter Spaces) and elaborate on their interest, their value add, their vision, etc. The working group will deliberate and form a shortlist of potential strategic partners.
4. Share the working group’s shortlist with the community via a forum post to gather input.
5. Come together as a working group to draw up the final details following community feedback. The diversification plan and the proposed new strategic partners will be put to an on-chain governance vote.

This process is purposefully designed with the objective of being open, transparent, and community-led. The Gitcoin community will be involved across the process and is integral to the decision making.

Taking this into consideration, the working group will arrive at a price at which to sell GTC to the new strategic partners based on community feedback and market reaction to the announcement.

Additionally, the working group will speak with lawyers to incorporate any relevant disclosures in the treasury diversification process. For tax purposes, Gitcoin should set aside a reserve and account for any tax liabilities resulting from the treasury diversification.

**Potential Strategic Partners**

Overall, GitcoinDAO is looking for long-term strategic partners that bring a diverse set of experience, competencies, and ideas to the table. They should see this as a partnership, whereby all parties will work together to nurture Gitcoin into the stellar project it aims to be. We invite participation from DAOs, Gitcoin community members, highly integral individuals in the crypto ecosystem, and groups that align with Gitcoin’s mission of funding public goods. We want to cultivate a robust group of entities and individuals from all parts of the crypto landscape.

Further detail is to be outlined in a follow-up forum post after forming the working group.

**Treasury Diversification Working Group**

As outlined in the Proposal section, the first step is to establish a 5-person working group to focus on the treasury diversification. We ask that interested members please respond to this forum post to submit their candidacy. We welcome and urge members from all walks of the community to apply. **If you are interested, please respond to this post with the following: involvement in the Gitcoin community, pertinent knowledge on treasury diversification / strategic partners / DAOs, and valuable experience across crypto and non-crypto roles that may be applicable.** We propose that Llama fills one of the five working group seats.

**Execution**

Once the treasury diversification working group establishes the details of the process, including execution price and possible new strategic partners, Llama can build smart contracts needed to execute the sale. The contracts will enable GitcoinDAO to enter counterparty addresses, token amounts, and the vesting schedule. The smart contracts will then stream GTC to the strategic partners according to the agreed-upon vesting schedule in exchange for USDC or DAI. These contracts should also immediately unlock the voting power for the new strategic partners for both vested and unvested tokens. This will help Gitcoin execute the diversification entirely on-chain and trustlessly after the governance vote passes. Implementation details may change based on feedback from the Gitcoin community and our strategic partners.

**Compensation**

Working group members will be compensated on a basis of $150/hr, with a maximum number of hours for an individual being 30.

Additionally, we propose that the working group be compensated for any legal expenses or security audits incurred from the operations pertaining to smart contract engineering and legal review of the process.

**Conclusion**

As noted above, this process is designed to be **open, transparent, and community-led**.

Gitcoin is not alone in facing this challenge; many other DAOs are heavily concentrated in their native tokens, resulting in issues with budgeting and paying contributors. A treasury diversification should be a win-win for both the DAO/community and incoming strategic partners. Ideally, Gitcoin’s treasury diversification should serve as a template for other DAOs facing the same challenges.

            <p>Congrats to the new Treasury WG ! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/partying_face.png?v=12" title=":partying_face:" class="emoji" alt=":partying_face:"><br>
Let us know how Dao members can support you.</p>
<p>And I agree UMA is a great candidate to research regarding treasury management.  I was introduced to them about 5 months ago and have been hanging out a bit in their Discord.  I think their future is pretty good so I signed up to their new SuperUMAn Dao too.  I have access to good content there, but ofc the gist of it is all in the docs online.  I am still learning what they can offer but here is a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k8hBjAhWoshZpo8hmE8XdFLwWdeVwfS6/view?usp=sharing" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">link to their basic slide deck describing how the KPI tokens work.</a><br>
Please ignore the blank slides in the deck.</p>
<p>One more <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YER8_iDSgrKzG50FB7VpXev0OkxqJRIW/view?usp=sharing" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">link to a newer UMA products called Success Tokens.</a></p>
<p>I am not sure how the KPI option tokens and Success Tokens compare to other alternatives but I will try to figure it out.  If nothing else I can connect the Gitcoin economists with the UMA economists.</p>
<p>I’d be happy to help facilitate any coordination between these groups.  Maybe EthDenver can be the catalyst.  UMA will have a sizeable group at EthDenver I hear.</p>
<p>And on another front entirely, 1Hive has partnered with Hedgey Decentralized Options to experiment with some treasury management ideas.  The first round resembled traditional option markets but for round two, which just began, they are trying a different approach.  They have basically grouped the five most common option scenarios into liquidity pools into-which dao members buy/invest with stablecoins.  So the protocol gets to sell some native tokens for stablecoins, and the dao-members get a chance to profit via discounted purchases of those native tokens.  A pic is worth a 1000 words so just <a href="http://app.hedgey.finance/#/moon/pool/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">take a glance at the website here</a> and you can get the idea.  Just imagine $GTC instead of $HNY, the native token of 1Hive.  Maybe we can reproduce this kind of market for $GTC in-house.  And probably important to mention it they are marketed as way to ‘go-long’ and support projects while benefiting by effectively locking in lower pricing of a dip.  They are not so much a degen leverage tool.  I can connect you with the Hedgey team if desired.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the feedback, <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/disruptionjoe">@DisruptionJoe</a>. I’m Daniel from the Llama team. We’re forming this working group to work on the diversification in a manner that’s lean and efficient while having community oversight. After we complete this diversification, we can explore a more permanent working group to focus on managing the overall treasury.</p>
<p>All of the execution can be done in a trustless manner after the working group has made its decision - we will build the smart contracts needed to facilitate the swaps and required vesting. There shouldn’t be too much to do operationally (just whitelisting investor addresses).</p>

            <p>I encourage the idea of <strong>including observers</strong>, in part as an educational/onboarding way to take advantage of enthusiasm vs. expertise in the long-run. Another way to look at it is institutional knowledge risk management.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am worried that we might select people who are enthusiastic, successful in other lines of work, and potentially great people for the DAO, but shouldn’t be in this working group unless they have a track record of great trades, proper risk management, and are web 3 native.</p>

            <p>Shreyes</p>
<p>Operationalizing this will be key to it’s success. Per <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/yalor">@Yalor</a> concern, I agree the team must be agile. The big question is “how do we mesh trust and reputation of the participants who action the funds allocation decisions with the expertise and degeneracy of those who best know what to do?”</p>
<p>Here are some ideas:</p>
<p><strong>Separate the operations from the subject matter experts</strong></p>
<p>The subject matter experts should be one step away from full degen, but are in the process of getting green pilled. Maybe offer payment as a percentage of their effect on the treasury rather than hourly. The working group may include 2 from CSDO and 3-5 SME.</p>
<p><strong>Have CSDO control the multisig used for execution</strong></p>
<p>When the working group makes a decision, the CSDO can execute it. Why? Because these are all workstream leads with history an reputation with Gitcoin. Plus, they are almost constantly available. They are some of the most active people in the DAO.</p>
<p><strong>Get great risk managers/portfolio managers on the SME working group</strong></p>
<p>Separating the operations from the decisions can allow for better checks and balances. It will let the SME group do what they do best without needing to administer anything. Take a lesson from traditional finance and have the operations executed separately.</p>
<p>I am worried that we might select people who are enthusiastic, successful in other lines of work, and potentially great people for the DAO, but shouldn’t be in this working group unless they have a track record of great trades, proper risk management, and are web 3 native.</p>

            <p>This is an invaluable proposal to long term health and sustainability of the DAO. I would love to participate. A bit of details about me:</p>
<p><strong>involvement in the Gitcoin community</strong> - I am currently Gitcoin Holdings COO, but I have resigned (effective Jan 31, 2022) and plan to work full time in the DAO starting Feb 1. I have worked to spin Gitcoin out of Consensys, fund raise, support our DAO launch, and now move full time to a contributor in the DAO.</p>
<p><strong>pertinent knowledge on treasury diversification / strategic partners / DAOs</strong> - I have observed a number of other DAO  diversifications and bring lots of learning from Gitcoin’s initial fund raise to capitalize the company ahead of the spin out from Consensys.</p>
<p><strong>valuable experience across crypto and non-crypto roles that may be applicable</strong> - Well, I hold a forgotten rune wizard, and a few moonshot bots <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=11" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> In my non-crypto world I was a product lead at Twitter for a number of years, and have been in the tech space for a while.</p>

HelloShreyas

            <p>Glad you’re interested, <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/jihad">@jihad</a>! You’ve added a ton of value to Gitcoin already and Forefront’s treasury diversification is a model I have in mind for Gitcoin.</p>

            <p>Appreciate the thoughtfulness of this proposal and excited to see this move forward.</p>
<p>I would love the opportunity to be a part of this Working Group.</p>
<p>In Q3 and Q4 of 2021, I contributed to Gitcoin’s Public Goods Funding workstream, helping to raise funds for GR12 and find ecosystem partners. Additionally, I have been a Core Contributor at Forefront since May 2021 and helped lead the DAO’s Treasury Diversification process. Finally, my work at Syndicate Protocol has given me the opportunity to support and advise on the treasury raises and allocations of a variety of new DAOs, helping navigate many common roadblocks.</p>
<p>Thanks again to <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/helloshreyas">@HelloShreyas</a> and the Llama team for the proposal!</p>

            <p>a pleasure, I agree to distribute the funds, I think it is a rule of large companies not to have all their money in one place, and looking at the issue of cryptos there are old currencies which hardly change in value, but always we will be subject to the volatility caused by some news or companies with other currencies.</p>
<p>I would gladly support the work team</p>

            <p>Thanks for your support and feedback, <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/lefterisjp">@lefterisjp</a>. Re. compensation - we think $150/hr is reasonable compensation in DeFi to attract strong people to serve in this working group. It is hard to find comparables that are apples-to-apples, but grants programs such as <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/Qmeza7LnzTLAGhHeA2psNtf1ua4kgm2Q1NHAMPeVzs5C2i" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Uniswap Grants</a> and <a href="https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-grants-update-and-renewal/6371" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Aave Grants</a> pays members $150/hr.</p>

            <p>hey <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/helloshreyas">@HelloShreyas</a> - as usual, nice work on the thoughtful proposal and love all the work you and the team do.  UMA community and I would be happy to help anywhere we can especially in the design of an instrument for diversification.  I think you are familiar with success tokens.  This would be a good way to raise funds.  Essentially sell GTC with a lock-up and no discount, but in return reward the holder a call option.  This would properly align incentives and ensure cooperation with the strategic partners.  Contracts are all audited and our DAO products such as KPI options have been used by many DeFi projects.  The Gitcoin treasury just needs to decide the parameters and we can deploy.<br>
Also, I would be happy to share our experiences diversifying and managing our treasury.  We were fortunate, but did make some good decisions over the last year and a half and have almost $50MM of non-UMA assets accumulated.</p>

            <p>I really applaud this proposal coming forth, as its hugely necessary for the longevity of the DAO. I’m coming in from Hedgey Finance, where we create tools specifically targeted towards helping DAOs diversify their treasury in responsible and transparent ways that benefit both the DAO and the community. I would be happy to sit on the diversification team, or even just advise from the side (but no need for compensation), and create a cohesive strategy utilizing various tools I’m familiar with and have used in advising other DAOs on diversification programs. Pre web3 I was a sr treasury manager at WeWork for 5+ years dealing with this sort of FX exposure &amp; cash flow diversification on a daily basis, and trying to bring traditional corp finance &amp; treasury to the web3 world.</p>

            <p>A treasury diversification team that can, as <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/yalor">@Yalor</a> also mentioned above, quickly adapt to market conditions would be something really needed.</p>
<p>Right now this DAO does not seem to have anything like that. What’s more to do anything with the treasury a public discussion and a public vote seems to need to happen which could put us at a huge disadvantage if a trade is involved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>$150/hr</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the only thing that just seems bit odd to me. As a European this look like a very high hourly compensation.</p>

            <p>This is a great initiative. Really love the mission to diversify treasury into stable coins + think it’s a good approach to discovering and executing the idea. Saw a post from LLama and thought I’d jump in to see how things progress. Cheers!</p>

            <p>Great move, I suggest we give the treasury team some power and authority to do it in a timely manor. We approved this process for MetaCartel 2 months ago and due to market fluctuations we lost about 30% of our budget capacity <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/grimacing.png?v=11" title=":grimacing:" class="emoji" alt=":grimacing:"></p>
