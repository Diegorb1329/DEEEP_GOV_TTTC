    Hey everyone,

I know a lot of people here started to work for DAOs in 2021.   A few of you have asked in different channels in Gitcoin discord about how to deal with the taxes on your token income in 2021.

Obviously, we should all be consulting tax resources in our own local jurisdictions, but I figured since there are 1000s of people at Gitcoin in each of the top 25 jurisdictions across the world, that I would create a place where we could share FAQ & other resources with each other.

So here goes, what questions do people have about taxes for 2021?  What resources have people found useful?
