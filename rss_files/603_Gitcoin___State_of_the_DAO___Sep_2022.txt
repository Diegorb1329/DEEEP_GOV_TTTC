Gitcoin - State of the DAO - Sep 2022
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-state-of-the-dao-sep-2022/11540
    I wanted to start to share my take on the state of the DAO. This style of presentation is often a presentation an executive team would give to a board of directors, but given the DAO [doesn't have a CEO](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-dao-has-no-ceo/9852), this could instead be for those who have a deep interest in Gitcoin or hold large amounts of GTC.

Thanks to everyone who made the weekly WS sync today. I appreciate the questions and for giving me the space to offer an opinion on the current state of the DAO.

Here is the deck I ran through (huge thanks to Lindsey and the team for helping me compose these!) - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f-vhZ0i5atpCskdarstO5FrDnPrng_6Wk33gxH1FFus/edit#slide=id.g104d241aaa0_6_0

The recording is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UZMjsDmYWtpVJYPax6xbAUBNt8Po73Tc/view?usp=sharing) as well.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments, especially if you could not attend.
