The Meta Trap ü™§
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-meta-trap/10666
    I recently learned about something called Meta-ness.

> If you think a typical cause has very high impact, it seems quite plausible that you can have even higher impact by working one level of ‚Äúmeta‚Äù up -- working not on that cause directly, but instead working on getting more people to work on that cause. [[The Meta Trap](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/KeipizrSxYFuyuyow)]

"meta" means "promoting impact in abstract, with the hope that people do good object level projects in the future". I'm talking about work that is trying to promote our mission in the abstract and may or may not have impact at the object level.

Now that we know about Meta, we can provide a [few thoughts on the **Meta Trap**](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/KeipizrSxYFuyuyow/p/vMtnMi3RHcy7Yaef5) from [this excellent post on it in the context of Effective Altruism](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/KeipizrSxYFuyuyow/p/vMtnMi3RHcy7Yaef5):

1. **Meta Orgs Risk Not Actually Having an Impact.** Since meta organizations are often several levels removed from direct impact, if even one of the "chains of impact" between levels fails to materialize, the meta org will not have any impact.
2. **Meta Orgs Risk Curling In On Themselves.** This is the failure mode where meta organizations are optimized to spread the meta-movement but fail to actually have object-level impact.
3. **You Can‚Äôt Use Meta as an Excuse for Cause Indecisiveness.** Donating to meta organizations allows you to skip the work of deciding which object-level cause is best, which is not good for the health of the movement.
4. **At Some Point, You Have to Stop Being Meta.** This is the worry that we do too much meta work and don't get around to doing object-level work soon enough.
5. **Sometimes, Well Executed Object-Level Action is What Best Grows the Movement.** For example, GiveWell built an excellent research product without focusing on outreach, but still ended up growing the movement.

# Applications at Gitcoin

When you fund a project in the context of Effective altruism, or in our case, https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/quadratic-funding-x-effective-altruism/10016/2 , it can have either object level impact or meta level impact.

When you do work on GitcoinDAO, it can either have object level impact or meta level impact.

Not all projects are worthwhile, and those that are at higher levels of meta are bigger risks to ever become worthwhile.  While some projects that have been funded at GitcoinDAO have been higher levels of meta, and some have been lower levels of meta, I've found that the lower level ones are more *sure things* whereas the higher levels of meta require more of a leap of faith to invest in.

Here is this idea laid out visually.

As the DAO clarifies is Purpose / Essential intent , the DAO should look out for meta traps. A few common Meta Traps from the [Thoughts on the Meta Trap post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/KeipizrSxYFuyuyow/p/vMtnMi3RHcy7Yaef5):

- Meta Trap #1a. Probability of not having an impact
- Meta Trap #1b. Overestimating impact

# Watch out for the Meta Trap

I encourage yall to [read about the Meta Trap](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/KeipizrSxYFuyuyow) and consider it as you go about your day to day work.  

My personal take having gone through multiple periods of https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/abundance-scarcity/10045 is that during times of abundance projects tend to get funded that are higher meta, and during times of scarcity, lower meta projects are the focus.   Hoping to see the DAO get more confident at estimating the probability of success of each project (using Meta-ness as an input and adjusting its ability to validate the priority of each project accordingly) as the market moves into a point of more scarcity.  Hopefully this will pay dividends by providing for a more smooth budgeting process in the future as workstreams won't get caught by surprise that their high-Meta project isnt funded in the future.

I'd welcome any feedback.

The Meta Trap ü™§
nate

            <p>I envision a future where:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>most object-level work (charitable projects) has verified impact per dollar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>organizations turn their outcomes into NFTs (impact certificates as you call them).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In such a world, it should be possible to track the exact impact of each grant. Maybe Gitcoin even receives impact certificates in exchange for funding.</p>
<p>If Gitcoin funds a project a layer up the meta stack, maybe impact certificates can be transferred up the stack as well.</p>
<p>Impact certificates are to grant funders what equity is to investors.</p>

<p>We discussed than specifically during the Grants weekly tactical( a call setup by Nate that has the scope of coordinating everything related to the gitcoin grants.

<p>It is not only spammers that we are worried about, we have entire organisations that have the goal of getting that sweet matching‚Ä¶ In GR12 and GR13 we ‚Äúcaught‚Äù projects that had 50-150k raised and considerable matchings.</p>

<p>We do plan to have an on chain component of adding a project to the registry from Grant Hub as well as publishing an on chain application for a grant round.

<p>Id say that QF is a very efficient way of meta-coordinating resource allocation + still creating object level impact.

<p>The other inflection point where the project has gotten really META has been the DAO spend.  The DAO is going to spend about $4mm in S14. This increased spend since the DAO launched hasn‚Äôt created that much more (or better) object level impact YET, but I think that might change.</p>
<p>IMO the last year of spend hasn‚Äôt been incredibly efficient inso far (Bull market gitcoin was trapped in the meta trap) as it has not created more object level impact (about $4mm deployed on the platform :: $4mm in spend, so a ratio of 1:1 of meta spending to object level spend) than when Holdings used to run the rounds on about $300k/quarter.</p>
<ol>
<li>Scale + economies of scale, and</li>
<li>Further focus of this spend on Grants 2.0 +</li>

The Meta Trap ü™§
ZER8

            <p>Very interesting post, reading this is actually quite illuminating and helps me understand why Gitcoin works like it does today. When you‚Äôve started to build Gitcoin (or realized down the road) was the organization aware about EA and ‚Äúmeta‚Äù when you decided to go more ‚Äúmeta‚Äù levels up at once with the ecosystem/cause rounds? <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>I can only guess what level of responsability and work ethic you posses Kevin, but speaking from the trenches of analyzing grants and mapping out some of the vulnerabilities in that area we may face some obstacles in the near future.( don‚Äôt want to be a negative nancy, trying to present my perspective)</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf you take meta-charity too far, you get a movement that‚Äôs really good at expanding itself but not necessarily good at actually helping people. This is ‚Äúthe meta trap‚Äù and this sequence explores why falling into it is a bad idea.‚Äù</p>
<p>Unfortunately I believe this has already started, I can‚Äôt ofc see things the way you do, but I can talk about the things that I‚Äôve personally encountered since I joined Gitcoin DAO a year ago.</p>
<p>Gitcoin is becoming more and more popular and it‚Äôs awesome.  Gitcoin grants are starting to be very popular for builders from ‚ÄúN‚Äù domains and it‚Äôs amazing, but the negative consequence is that while this growth also fuels our ecosystems it could also be very problematic. The number of fake grant,  grants that ‚Äúemulate‚Äù EA and fraudulent applications is increasing at an accelerated rate. I don‚Äôt have the exact numbers(it‚Äôs almost impossible to track), but I will surely attempt to approximate these numbers for GR14.  (I‚Äôm the ‚ÄúRound Manager‚Äù from the FDD and one of my responsabilitites is to filter grant applications from a sybil perspective and also eligibility perspective before approving them on the platform).</p>
<p>My opinion is that this is a consequence of the ‚Äúmeta-trap‚Äù. The collective altruism and high level overview on things here attracts parasites at the lower levels, both internally and externally <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/worm.png?v=12" title=":worm:" class="emoji" alt=":worm:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> (because sometimes they are hard to spot) <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/dart.png?v=12" title=":dart:" class="emoji" alt=":dart:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>I‚Äôm very curious what you think, could we attract the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù type of audience and is this is small consequence of the ‚Äúmeta-trap‚Äù that you described?  (or I‚Äôm making bad connections by linking these two aspects).</p>
<p>I know that you‚Äôre more interested in high level overviews and architectures, but I‚Äôve heard that the most successful builders can zoom out, but when needed they can also zoom in <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>As the DAO clarifies is Purpose / Essential intent , the DAO should look out for meta traps. A few common Meta Traps from the <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/KeipizrSxYFuyuyow/p/vMtnMi3RHcy7Yaef5">Thoughts on the Meta Trap post</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meta Trap <span class="hashtag-raw">#1a</span>. Probability of not having an impact</li>

<p>I encourage yall to <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/KeipizrSxYFuyuyow">read about the Meta Trap</a> and consider it as you go about your day to day work.</p>
<p>My personal take having gone through multiple periods of <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/abundance-scarcity/10045" class="inline-onebox">Abundance &amp; Scarcity</a> is that during times of abundance projects tend to get funded that are higher meta, and during times of scarcity, lower meta projects are the focus.   Hoping to see the DAO get more confident at estimating the probability of success of each project (using Meta-ness as an input and adjusting its ability to validate the priority of each project accordingly) as the market moves into a point of more scarcity.  Hopefully this will pay dividends by providing for a more smooth budgeting process in the future as workstreams won‚Äôt get caught by surprise that their high-Meta project isnt funded in the future.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd welcome any feedback.</p>
