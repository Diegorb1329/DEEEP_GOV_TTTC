    Hi folks,
I have written a number of times about this in Discord, but we have had a project that is impersonating ours for 6+ months and has stolen about 1k from Gitcoin users (and in a roundabout way taken funds for us).

Our legitimate project (created first, is this hard to check?): https://gitcoin.co/grants/4719/defining-web3-an-off-chain-collective-research-pr

The fake one: https://gitcoin.co/grants/5514/defining-web3

I have reported this project a couple of times now to both Gitcoin and Github and am told it will be addressed in Discord, but then hear nothing. 

As a last resort I am bringing it up here. One to highlight the specific problem and two to show how difficult it can be as a grantee to get your voices heard about people copying your project.

            <p>Thanks Joe! If anything I think the benefit of our case means this has been highlighted. I do feel from the other perspective itâ€™s a little hard to get your voice heard in this scenario, so it might be worth discussing.</p>

            <p>That makes me very happy! Itâ€™s not a major deal to us as Uni Profs, but I hated the idea of people donating to someone who just set up a page.<br>
As always, Gitcoin rocks!</p>

            <p>Apologies that this took so long to address. If itâ€™s any consolation, it appears this grant never received any donations or matching funds:</p>

            <p>Well this is embarrassing. Our communications between support and FDD which deals with fraudulent impersonation were not up to par. I will be looking into making sure this doesnâ€™t happen again.</p>
<p>I found your message to support a few months ago and then there was one a couple weeks ago. I donâ€™t have any insight as to why the ball was dropped at this time.</p>
<p>It is fixed now and the fake grant is deactivated (but still visible if you go directly to the link).</p>
