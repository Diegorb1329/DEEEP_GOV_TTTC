    # [Gitcoin Community Proposal] - RocketPool oDAO participation

## Summary

Gitcoin was recently [invited to participate](https://rocketscan.io/dao/proposals) in Rocket Poolâ€™s oDAO, to do so we need to stake 1750 RPL (which we have from an airdrop from the Rocket Pool community in our Matching Pool) and ensure we have a validator running to perform oDAO required tasks. If we are selected, we will earn rewards for participation which will go back to the Matching Pool. I am asking for permission to use 1750RPL to post a bond for our participation, set up a validator with 16Eth, and foster a relationship with Rocket Pool where we support the decentralization of Ethereum.

## Abstract

Rocket Pool is one of the leading staking protocol providers for individuals to stake at home. You can read more about [Rocket Pool here](https://rocketpool.net/#how-it-works). Essentially individual node operators can stake ETH to secure the beacon chain using Rocket Poolsâ€™ protocol and in doing so, they earn RPL rewards. So I, Kyle, would stake 16Eth to run a validator node and my Eth is paired with Eth from another community member who wants to stake their Eth, but doesnt want to run a node themself. Often the rewards are pooled to increase the total rewards of those staking.

Rocket Pool has an Oracle DAO (oDAO) that ensures those who are participating in the Rocket Pool network are good actors. This oracle membership in oDAO provides the Rocket Pool network assurances that the rewards paid out are fairly and accurately and essentially helps confirm the Rocket Pool protocol is running as it should. Gitcoin has been invited to run an Oracle node, and join oDAO. You can read more about oDAO [in this post](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-2-e0d346911fe1).

oDAO members are rewarded for participating, and offered a seat at the governance table with Rocket Pool. You can review past proposals and learn more about participation in oDAO [here](https://rocketscan.io/dao/). A number of other great communities already participate in oDAO (Fire eyes, Eth Staker community, Nimbus, Etherscan, etc.)

## Motivation

As discussed in past posts, finding recurring and sustainable funding models for funding public goods is high on our priority list. At the same time, growing and continuing to be good stewards and partners to other protocols in the space has long been in our Ethos. I love the idea of supporting a fellow protocol as it continues to grow, and it is with our support we can also secure the Beacon chain. Partnering with Rocket Pool enables the DAO to accomplish a few key tasks:

1. We can help secure both the Ethereum network by running a validator, and also help secure the Rocket Pool protocol via their oDAO participation.
2. We can partner with a leading Ethereum Validator protocol, and earn rewards by doing so.
3. Those rewards can be used to participate in governance in the Rocket Pool community, and if desired, fund public goods.

By participating in Rocket Poolâ€™s oDAO we will play our part in a broader ecosystem while being rewarded for that action. This will further the good will of Gitcoin, and also broaden our participation in securing the Ethereum Network.

## Specification

In order to participate a few things need to happen:

1. We need to run a Rocket Pool validator Node
2. We need to be formally invited by Rocket pool
3. We need to post a bond of 1750 to confirm we will perform our validator duties adequately
4. Once we are formally invited, and the bond is posted, we can begin our oDAO membership and services.

I Have been running a validator node since genesis at home, and have recently stood up a (brand new) Rocket Pool validator node on spare hardware for this task. Taking on the Oracle verification steps required by oDAO should be straightforward and easy to keep up with as the software mostly runs on its own.

I am requesting to use the 1750 RPL that was airdropped to the DAO and put it to work back in the community that entrusted us with those tokens to begin with.

The full documentation for how to set up a node can be found here, and the oDAO details are here.

Some of the key account details can be found here to ensure transparency on the token accrual. ![|720x256](upload://2rdkFCkMZprP7Nns8rEjb9LhvlD.png)

I would also like to stake 16 Eth from the Matching pool to run a validator and earn rewards for the DAO. That earned Eth can be withdrawn at any time (after the Shanghai hard fork), and will continue to grow at a rate of around 7% annually.

## Benefits

This proposal enables us to support a growing protocol, earn rewards for doing so, and also gives us an opportunity to participate in governance with Rocket Poolâ€™s oDAO.

## Drawbacks

This participation gives us a responsibility with another community, and it is important we take that to heart when committing. This means, we will need to ensure we have a node running and are able to perform our duties with the highest up time possible. One potential drawback is in the event our node is no longer operational (power outages, hardware outages, etc.) we may be asked to leave the oDAO and lose part if not all of our bond.

The current value of the RPL tokens and Eth being requested is worth just under $114K USD. These funds could be sold and used in other places. Though we donâ€™t have a need for them today, I want to call out this is a drawback in the immediate term.

## Vote

For this vote, I am proposing three options:

1 - Yes to joining oDAO and posting the 1750 RPL bond, and also establish a validator on Rocket Pool with 16 Eth

2 - Yes to joining oDAO and posting the 1750 RPL bond, but do not create a validator node with 16 Eth

3 - Do not use the 1750 RPL and 16 Eth to take these actions

I am looking forward to hearing from the community on what they think ðŸ™‚

            <p>Hey all - An update on this. The vote has passed! Thank you to everyone for the support.</p>
<p>I have gone through and done the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Joined the RocketPool oDAO with the following node address: 0x58fa2ca71c4a37f6B280fc55e04cC8Effa68a18A</li>
<li>Deposited 16Eth into the node to kick off our first DAO validator! The minipool address is: 0x1337b9d32B57188914bbF82F995e083C4De96B8B<br>
This will go live in a few days once we get through the que.</li>
<li>Configured the oDAO node and I am in the process of testing our ability to generate the proofs for the node.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, its been a great personal experience to dive back into Linux and work with the RocketPool folks to get this going. I will share validator status as I have that <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/raised_hands.png?v=12" title=":raised_hands:" class="emoji" alt=":raised_hands:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p>Great question! I think another oDAO member was down for over 60 days before a proposal went live to kick them outâ€¦ Although outages happen, I highly doubt we would ever have an outage that long.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m in support of this proposal (Option 1) but Iâ€™d like to see this risk evaluated a bit more. How long does the node need to be offline in order to be kicked out of the oDAO? Can we quantify this risk and implement some mitigation strategies?</p>

            <p>Iâ€™m supportive for the reasons articulated here and, tbh, because of the enthusiasm expressed as well.</p>
<p>Living our values by helping to defend the commons seems right on every level.</p>
<p>Secondarily - if running these nodes becomes challenging then either we unwind (as <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kevin.olsen">@kevin.olsen</a> mentions it wd be nice to see this unwind or exit option briefly articulated) or gitcoin can build a little more devops muscle to address, which seems like a capability we need for passport and otherwise.</p>
<p>Iâ€™d vote for option 1.</p>

            <p>Iâ€™m supportive of this, and would go with option 1 as well.</p>
<p>Just for transparency, I spoke with Kyle about the process for unwinding this if we wanted to continue for whatever reason, and feel confident that this would be a painless process. Iâ€™d love to normalize documenting the failure case in our future GCPs so that we can consider the full scope of these proposals.</p>

            <p>I vote Yes with the first option of joining oDAO and posting 1750 RPL bond, and also establishing a validator on Rocket Pool with 16 ETH.</p>

<a name="gitcoin-community-proposal-rocketpool-odao-participation-1" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#gitcoin-community-proposal-rocketpool-odao-participation-1"></a>[Gitcoin Community Proposal] - RocketPool oDAO participation</h1>
<h2>
<a name="summary-2" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#summary-2"></a>Summary</h2>
<p>Gitcoin was recently <a href="https://rocketscan.io/dao/proposals">invited to participate</a> in Rocket Poolâ€™s oDAO, to do so we need to stake 1750 RPL (which we have from an airdrop from the Rocket Pool community in our Matching Pool) and ensure we have a validator running to perform oDAO required tasks. If we are selected, we will earn rewards for participation which will go back to the Matching Pool. I am asking for permission to use 1750RPL to post a bond for our participation, set up a validator with 16Eth, and foster a relationship with Rocket Pool where we support the decentralization of Ethereum.</p>
<h2>
<a name="abstract-3" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#abstract-3"></a>Abstract</h2>
<p>Rocket Pool is one of the leading staking protocol providers for individuals to stake at home. You can read more about <a href="https://rocketpool.net/#how-it-works">Rocket Pool here</a>. Essentially individual node operators can stake ETH to secure the beacon chain using Rocket Poolsâ€™ protocol and in doing so, they earn RPL rewards. So I, Kyle, would stake 16Eth to run a validator node and my Eth is paired with Eth from another community member who wants to stake their Eth, but doesnt want to run a node themself. Often the rewards are pooled to increase the total rewards of those staking.</p>
<p>Rocket Pool has an Oracle DAO (oDAO) that ensures those who are participating in the Rocket Pool network are good actors. This oracle membership in oDAO provides the Rocket Pool network assurances that the rewards paid out are fairly and accurately and essentially helps confirm the Rocket Pool protocol is running as it should. Gitcoin has been invited to run an Oracle node, and join oDAO. You can read more about oDAO <a href="https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-2-e0d346911fe1">in this post</a>.</p>
<p>oDAO members are rewarded for participating, and offered a seat at the governance table with Rocket Pool. You can review past proposals and learn more about participation in oDAO <a href="https://rocketscan.io/dao/">here</a>. A number of other great communities already participate in oDAO (Fire eyes, Eth Staker community, Nimbus, Etherscan, etc.)</p>
<h2>
<a name="motivation-4" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#motivation-4"></a>Motivation</h2>
<p>As discussed in past posts, finding recurring and sustainable funding models for funding public goods is high on our priority list. At the same time, growing and continuing to be good stewards and partners to other protocols in the space has long been in our Ethos. I love the idea of supporting a fellow protocol as it continues to grow, and it is with our support we can also secure the Beacon chain. Partnering with Rocket Pool enables the DAO to accomplish a few key tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>We can help secure both the Ethereum network by running a validator, and also help secure the Rocket Pool protocol via their oDAO participation.</li>
<li>We can partner with a leading Ethereum Validator protocol, and earn rewards by doing so.</li>
<li>Those rewards can be used to participate in governance in the Rocket Pool community, and if desired, fund public goods.</li>
</ol>
<p>By participating in Rocket Poolâ€™s oDAO we will play our part in a broader ecosystem while being rewarded for that action. This will further the good will of Gitcoin, and also broaden our participation in securing the Ethereum Network.</p>
<h2>
<a name="specification-5" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#specification-5"></a>Specification</h2>
<p>In order to participate a few things need to happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>We need to run a Rocket Pool validator Node</li>
<li>We need to be formally invited by Rocket pool</li>
<li>We need to post a bond of 1750 to confirm we will perform our validator duties adequately</li>
<li>Once we are formally invited, and the bond is posted, we can begin our oDAO membership and services.</li>
</ol>
<p>I Have been running a validator node since genesis at home, and have recently stood up a (brand new) Rocket Pool validator node on spare hardware for this task. Taking on the Oracle verification steps required by oDAO should be straightforward and easy to keep up with as the software mostly runs on its own.</p>
<p>I am requesting to use the 1750 RPL that was airdropped to the DAO and put it to work back in the community that entrusted us with those tokens to begin with.</p>
<p>The full documentation for how to set up a node can be found here, and the oDAO details are here.</p>
<p>Some of the key account details can be found here to ensure transparency on the token accrual. </p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/1/1117e7b3b1be8021c009728688b2b0f2d1f22241.png" data-download-href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/1117e7b3b1be8021c009728688b2b0f2d1f22241" title=""><img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/1/1117e7b3b1be8021c009728688b2b0f2d1f22241_2_690x245.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="2rdkFCkMZprP7Nns8rEjb9LhvlD" width="690" height="245" role="presentation" srcset="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/1/1117e7b3b1be8021c009728688b2b0f2d1f22241_2_690x245.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/1/1117e7b3b1be8021c009728688b2b0f2d1f22241_2_1035x367.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/1/1117e7b3b1be8021c009728688b2b0f2d1f22241_2_1380x490.png 2x" data-dominant-color="050908"></a></div><p></p>
<p>I would also like to stake 16 Eth from the Matching pool to run a validator and earn rewards for the DAO. That earned Eth can be withdrawn at any time (after the Shanghai hard fork), and will continue to grow at a rate of around 7% annually.</p>
<h2>
<a name="benefits-6" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#benefits-6"></a>Benefits</h2>
<p>This proposal enables us to support a growing protocol, earn rewards for doing so, and also gives us an opportunity to participate in governance with Rocket Poolâ€™s oDAO.</p>
<h2>
<a name="drawbacks-7" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#drawbacks-7"></a>Drawbacks</h2>
<p>This participation gives us a responsibility with another community, and it is important we take that to heart when committing. This means, we will need to ensure we have a node running and are able to perform our duties with the highest up time possible. One potential drawback is in the event our node is no longer operational (power outages, hardware outages, etc.) we may be asked to leave the oDAO and lose part if not all of our bond.</p>
<p>The current value of the RPL tokens and Eth being requested is worth just under $114K USD. These funds could be sold and used in other places. Though we donâ€™t have a need for them today, I want to call out this is a drawback in the immediate term.</p>
<h2>
<a name="vote-8" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#vote-8"></a>Vote</h2>
<p>For this vote, I am proposing three options:</p>
<p>1 - Yes to joining oDAO and posting the 1750 RPL bond, and also establish a validator on Rocket Pool with 16 Eth</p>
<p>2 - Yes to joining oDAO and posting the 1750 RPL bond, but do not create a validator node with 16 Eth</p>
<p>3 - Do not use the 1750 RPL and 16 Eth to take these actions</p>
<p>I am looking forward to hearing from the community on what they think <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=12" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
