# üî• Hot Topics:

* FDD launched the [Great Gitcoin Grant Eligibility Hunt](https://twitter.com/gitcoin/status/1564355531078127617?s=20&t=opnC5RZp3N5aRg1OUISYFA) on [Ethelo](https://ethelo.com/). We will release seven sets of grants, one each day. Each set has an open review window of 72 hours. Participants get a limited edition POAP ‚Äì your agent badge and key to future events!

* [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki) answers the question [Who is a cofounder of Gitcoin?](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/knowledge-transfer-who-is-a-cofounder-of-gitcoin/11371) The title was offered to multiple people over the years, with a clause that to retain the title they must work at Gitcoin for four years. ‚ÄúAs of August 2022, my interpretation of the above history & neutral reading of these agreements is that Kevin Owocki, Kyle Weiss, and Scott Moore are the current cofounders of Gitcoin.‚Äù

* [Kyle](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle) asks for a [recap on how partnerships are going](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/recap-partnerships-to-date-how-are-these-going/11349). [Vishnu](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/vgk/summary) shares that they‚Äôve kickstarted a mutual grants committee who have written a methodology for considering mutual grants and reviewed 30 grants based on those criteria. The four criteria are values-alignment, strategic utility, growth potential, and feasibility and effectiveness. Pre-existing mutual grants include PrimeDAO (with whom we‚Äôre working on a proposal inverter), DeveloperDAO (who just launched their governance token), and Radicle(with whom we‚Äôre currently executing a tokenswap). Outside of mutual grants, Vishnu also highlights that the [CLR Fund 40k GTC grant](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-issue-clr-fund-a-40k-gtc-grant/8240/10) was a ‚Äúno strings attached gesture‚Äù and that we have a long line-up of matching partners. They include Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, Momus.Eth, Yearn, Polygon, Aave, and many more.

* In his [treasury diversification update](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-treasury-diversification-update/10932/11), [Kyle](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle) lets us know that $1MM of GTC has been converted to USDC and sent back to the treasury. This will continue until all of the remaining balance of GTC in the account has been diversified. Kyle flags that ‚Äúthis is a slight deviation from the proposal which stated excess GTC would go back to the treasury.‚Äù While outside [the proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0x0eb45cfd31ddd2701af3d74ce38a9e87292fe42a6b40b26812ff9889b07daeb3), this was approved [last week by CSDO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEV14USOGH8).

* üéôLatest Episodes from the [GreenPill](http://availableon.com/greenpill) Podcast with [Kevin Owocki](http://twitter.com/owocki):
  * [GovernorDAO with Jon Greenwood & Zane Huffman - Green Pill #39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_9UpVagZ0). As part of the current series on sybil resistance, learn about a protocol that offers a Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS) sandbox for any project to ensure their governance model works out of the box.

# üó≥Ô∏è Gitcoin Governance Overview:

Snapshot polls GTC Holders and Tally performs on-chain actions. Proposals that have on-chain steps, such as budget requests, move on to Tally after being ratified on Snapshot.

# [üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Workstream Discussion](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/workstream-discussion/9):

## üå± [Public Goods Funding](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Public-Goods-4ccd579f433c4dff9d8952314468d6e8)

* We‚Äôre gearing up for GR15 and are excited to have a [main round, 4 cause rounds, and 13 ecosystem rounds](https://gitcoin.co/blog/level-up-your-grant-for-gr15/)! Our partnerships team has been hard at work locking in funders and did a great job raising $2.8M despite being in a bear market.

* In GR15, for the first time, we are [decoupling eligibility for main and side rounds](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gr15-round-structure/11272). Previously, projects needed to be approved for the main round before they could be approved for the platform or for side rounds. Now, we‚Äôre giving our partners more control than ever over who‚Äôs eligible for quadratic funding. This is a big step towards a protocol world.

## [üöÄ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-prototyping-workstream-moonshot-budget-request-q4-2021/8785) [Moonshot Collective](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Moonshot-Collective-e8a5bbb2b6f3494db109849d159e1b51)

* **Quadratic Voting:** We are working on a Product Requirements Document(PRD) to layout goals, stakeholders, projects, and milestones. Once the PRD is complete, the discovery phase can begin in earnest, to figure out the solution/building milestones.

* **Operations:** This week, the MC Operations team reviewed three proposals to address the ‚Äúsuccess themes‚Äù of: Cross-Stream Accountability, Initiative Accountability and Idea Intake/Vetting.

* **Identity Staking:** This week the Identity Staking team built out the bulk of the UI for the product. Our smart contract code for Identity Staking is currently being reviewed and audited. We also posted [a bounty in Buidl Guidl](https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/Identity-Staking-Smart-Contract-Bounty-679584b2a55c4afb89a18f72307f8397) (open to all, not just Buidl Guidl peeps). By end-of-week, the team aims to complete UI work, finish auditing the Smart Contract code, and to begin doing some user testing on Friday.

## üíô [Fraud Detection & Defense](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Fraud-Detection-Defense-2bde13c0b8e74fda81435d94e49e2703)

* [J-cook](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/j-cook) posted a vision for [decentralizing Sybil defense](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/decentralizing-sybil-defense-using-gitcoin-data/11382) and empowering communities to run their own Sybil detection algorithms on top of open datasets, rather than having a monolithic (and centralized) defense strategy. Part of the infrastructure to do this will come naturally with Grants 2.0. But additional infra for analyzing, training models, and making decisions needs to be created and made accessible to as many people as possible.

* We are continuing to build labeled datasets of known Sybil users and supporting Gitcoin Passport on stamp scoring mechanisms for GR15.

## üé® [Merch, Memes & Marketing](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Merch-Memes-and-Marketing-60cc693f0fe14be1879a05587922c8a3)

* **Programs:** We are preparing for GR15 Launch Week! We‚Äôll be pushing out fresh tweets and emails as well as running several events. Check them out in the community events sectionüëá

* **Protocols:** We‚Äôre putting on the finishing touches for Passport marketing materials ahead of GR15 (including our new marketing website) and supporting the Customer Service team to have the Knowledge Base fully updated. We‚Äôre also finalizing logos for the Grants Protocol suite (preview coming soon) and creating a roadmap for audience persona analysis.

* **MMM OS:** We‚Äôre finalizing a compensation logic model for core contributors and planning to roll this out in in S16. Have you seen our new Notion [m-m-m.xyz](http://m-m-m.xyz/) and updated [project tracker](https://gitcoin.notion.site/MMM-Projects-3e1f5752d2a545ae8fd6e894555d0a58)?

* **Content:** We published two new blog articles:
  * [‚ÄúGitcoin: Supporting Builders in Bull and Bear Markets‚Äù](https://gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-supporting-builders-in-bull-and-bear-markets/)
  * [‚Äú4 Ways Gitcoin Passport Can Help DAOs‚Äù](https://gitcoin.co/blog/4-ways-gitcoin-passport-can-help-daos/).

## ‚òÄÔ∏è [DAO Operations](https://gitcoin.notion.site/DAO-Ops-84f425e281ae49579a2b4acf0bad5dd5)

* **[CSDO]**(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWEiZu1Jqkqn-axtQdtrNLg): In this week‚Äôs CSDO, we discussed whether we will be hosting Schelling Point at EthDenver. We decided to keep bringing this event to people and are still determining who will be running it if the events workstream is unavailable. We also surfaced a tension about how round policies get created and enforced between FDD and PGF. The two teams will touch base and there will be a proposal that can go through a consent-based process.

* Our support team has been hard at work upgrading and updating our [Knowledge Base](http://support.gitcoin.co/) ahead of GR15. We‚Äôve been partnering closely with MMM & PGF and are excited that our [documentation](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-grants/tips-for-grant-success) and [videos](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-grants/how-to-create-a-gitcoin-grant) will answer many grantee questions.

## üõ† [Gitcoin Product Collective](https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/Gitcoin-Product-Collective-f2860138cbb24505b5cb2d8576119a78)

* [**Grants Hub**](https://gitcoin.notion.site/18fe2a4947274d4db70f7d3714d0a931?v=3088537ab7794279a05c456b4e746f83):
  * We are about 90% production-ready with Grant Hub Phase 2 (Anchor). Our [latest demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vkvXHQ07XswhTT6z-ijkH5kYZ_6R25mj/view?usp=sharing) shows off how you can connect with multiple wallets including Metamask, Rainbow, and Coinbase. You can also see our latest designs for creating a new project on the Hub.
  * Last week, we hosted our Monthly Team Retro. The recap can be found in the #grant-hub channel in the Discord. DM your local Discord admin for access, if needed.
  * Our product team also worked on the first draft of the ‚ÄúProof of Projecthood‚Äù product brief. There is an open request for feedback for this draft. View and [make comments here](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Vision-Goal-Proof-of-Projecthood-Brief-c3894d2a2743481081022945fb199cff). The team is seeking to finalize the brief this week.

Our partnerships team has been hard at work locking in funders and did a great job raising $2.8M despite being in a bear market.</p>

<li>
<p>In GR15, for the first time, we are <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gr15-round-structure/11272">decoupling eligibility for main and side rounds</a>. Previously, projects needed to be approved for the main round before they could be approved for the platform or for side rounds. Now, we‚Äôre giving our partners more control than ever over who‚Äôs eligible for quadratic funding. This is a big step towards a protocol world.</p>
