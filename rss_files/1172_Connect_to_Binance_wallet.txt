    Can we connect to Binance? The international app,  not the US. I think many people have their wallet in that platform.

            <p>You canâ€™t use the Binance wallet with Gitcoin, Binance doesnâ€™t support that the type of transactions needed.</p>

            <p>I think you need a VPN somewhere where Binance is legal. Proton VPN has a free Netherlands server that I always use to trade on Binance and I never had a problem with Binance locking my funds.</p>
