            <p>Hi, I’m Knight Talks<br>
A Web3 community builder and X Space host, passionate about decentralization, open collaboration, and the power of Web3 communities. My focus is on helping newcomers navigate the space, find opportunities, and grow together.</p>
<p>Public Goods Funding, DAOs, and Open Source resonate with me because they embody the core ethos of Web3—permissionless innovation, shared ownership, and sustainability. I believe that funding public goods ensures the longevity of impactful projects, DAOs enable collective decision-making, and open-source development fosters transparency and accessibility for all</p>

I’m Alex. I’ve worked for some years now as an individual code contributor in different startup settings and have become increasingly jaded about working in the corporate tech-industrial complex. I found “Read, Write, Own: Building the Next Era of the Internet” by Chris Dixon on sale at a local bookstore. I got about halfway through and decided to find ways to get started and participate.</p>
<p>My search brought me here to Gitcoin and also to Cyfrin’s Blockchain Developer Courses. My goal in the next quarter is to engage and learn with the intention to help build web3 tools to empower local communities. I look forward to participating in this community <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/bowing_man.png?v=12" title=":bowing_man:" class="emoji" alt=":bowing_man:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> !</p>

            <p>Hi everyone – I’m new to the forum but wanted to introduce myself!</p>
<p>I’ve been following gitcoin for a while and I’m now building an SDK that helps onchain users make charitable donations via transaction fees as they interface with onchain protocols. Almost like a “round-up” for charity functionality.</p>
<p>Hoping to contribute to the forum more actively and if this interests you, feel free to reach out!</p>

            <p>Hi, I’m Diogo J, founder of AgroforestDAO, a growing movement towards a rooted network society. I’ve been following the forum and participating in the rounds for a couple of years. Our organization is now onboarding food forest stewards to web3 and I hope we can coordinate with other humans in the local, regional and global layers. We want to launch our first internal QF round in december and maybe one day join forces with the land based rounds happening here. Thanks for all the Service you’ve been doing <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/pray.png?v=12" title=":pray:" class="emoji" alt=":pray:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p>I am Sid, a dedicated enthusiast in the realm of Blockchain and Web3, diving deep into the transformative potential of Public Goods Funding, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), and the Open Source movement. My passion lies in leveraging technology to foster transparency and fairness, a mission that resonates with the core values of these communities.</p>
<p>My path to Gitcoin was carved by my transition from the traditional financial sector in Brazil to the dynamic world of blockchain. I am captivated by the ethos of Gitcoin, which champions open-source development and aligns with my commitment to contribute to the public good.</p>
<p>Beyond my professional pursuits, I am a strong advocate for responsible innovation and community-driven development. I believe that through collective effort and shared wisdom, we can create a more equitable future, and I am eager to collaborate and grow within this vibrant ecosystem.</p>

            <p>Hi everyone!<br>
My name is Shawn and I am really excited to be joining Gitcoin DAO Ops, working with Governance.  As a tradbiz refugee and reformed capitalist, I am passionate about finding new paths for business, people, and communities to grow together equitably.</p>
<p>I found my way to Gitcoin as I worked with Mitz over at Index Coop and she mentioned I should look into Gitcoin given I was doing a ton of Governance &amp; people work at Index.  Turns out, I already have a lot of friends here <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>I find part of the magic of web3 is the forkability of opensource processes &amp; technology.  Anything we can do to determine which problems need to be solved, channel resources into solving those problems, and make the solutions easy for others to reapply - is worth our energy.  I think the DAO experiment can change the world, and I am here to nudge it that direction.</p>

            <p>Hey everyone, and thanks for the reminder to intro myself here Loie!</p>
<p>I’m Saf! I’ve also been at Gitcoin DAO for about a month now, initially hired to be “hiring coordinator”, but that’s sort of shifting to becoming an “anti-hiring coordinator” after the change in markets during my time here haha. I have a background in mechanical engineering and career development at a university, and have done people-y things for various organizations, including other DAOs.<br>
I’m very excited about the regen web3 space - it’s basically what makes me get up in the morning - and I’m excited to help grow the space by building community-centric hiring processes and structures for Gitcoin DAO.</p>

<p>I’m happy to share that I joined Gitcoin last month. Loie helped me see that there’s a space for all things people-y and I’ve been excited to join web3 ever since. I come from a background in HR/DEI/advocacy. My goal is to support contributors with their professional journey at Gitcoin and help answer any questions from benefits, development, etc. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p>Hey, Jodi here. I spent the last 3~ years following the web3 space, and met <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/pop">@Pop</a> at DevCon 5 in Osaka. I joined Gitcoin last month after 10+ years in local government, economic development, and start-ups orgs. What attracted me to Gitcoin is it’s democratically-based experimentation around public goods funding and flat organizational structure. I’m excited about what we’re doing here, and believe that if we move quickly and with focus, we will create a truly impactful model for digital and IRL community organization and service.</p>

            <p>Hey there my name is Mike. I learned about Gitcoin last year after starting my research journey through web3. I’m a hardcore lurker online but I feel its time to make my presence known. I am really interested in DAO’s, crypto, NFT’s and researching web3. I am currently trying to find a way to contribute and be a part of a team. Hopefully in due time I will evolve from casual lurker to social buttery. One post a time.</p>

            <p>I’m Rachael!</p>
<p>Found my way to Gitcoin after getting interested in web3 last year. Met <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation">@ceresstation</a>, Linh, and <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle">@Kyle</a> - and definitely got excited about the passion everyone had.</p>
<p>I’m super interested in the idea of providing great experiences - specifically around people-y experiences. So from recruiting, to onboarding, to retention - I want people to feel excited about whatever may be next. Perhaps great experiences in web3 is a public good??</p>
<p>Excited to jump into the forum more <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
