    # GG23: Supporting Builders at Every Stage of Growth

The below is an overview of the new structure of Gitcoin Grants, specifically outlining what GG23 will look like. Specific eligibility criteria for the OSS Program and a matching pool funding request will be posted separately, followed by ratification through a vote. Thank you to @meglister, @owocki, @deltajuliet, @Sov @LauNaMu, @Jonassft for your valuable input into this strategy. A special thank you to Open Source Observer, @rohit & @ccerv1, for being an integral part of designing the below. *Bringing this to life is a huge team effort from the GG team, product, marketing, engineering as well as the community.*

## TL;DR

It's time to evolve the Gitcoin Grants program to align with the wider ecosystem as well as our own builder needs. Gitcoin Grants 23 (GG23) is designed to support builders at every stage of growth by evolving our funding mechanisms and round structure:

* **Quadratic Funding (QF):** For early-stage projects to engage their communities and grow through crowdfunding.
* **Retro Funding (RF):** For mature, high-impact projects, distributing more funding to a curated selection of top GG builders.
* **Grant Ships** will be the new mechanism to govern Community Rounds.
* Builder Support Beyond Funding: Continuing a Builder Onboarding Program and launching further spaces for builders to collaborate with one another (details TBC).
* **Data-Driven & Community-Curated:** Working with OSO to develop clear metrics that determine project eligibility for each funding round, as well as the metrics for the Retro Round.

---

## GG23 Funding Structure

We are sunsetting the Hackathon Alumni round, and returning our focus back to 3 main QF OSS rounds within the program. This ensures fair funding distribution and a more focused OSS Program, including the allocation towards Retro Funding.

|Round|Funding Allocation|
| --- | --- |
|QF - dApps & Apps|$200K|
|QF - Dev Tooling|$200K|
|QF - Web3 Infra|$200K|
|Retro Funding|$600K|
|Community Rounds|$150K|

Total Matching Pool: **$1.35M**

***Note:** Funding amounts are subject to slight adjustment as the eligibility get finalized. Final funding amounts will be requested through governance in a separate post. We will also be requesting an additional small percentage from the matching pool to run a GTC staking experiment during GG23.*

### Quadratic Funding (QF) ‚Üí Early-Stage Projects

* Designed for projects in their growth phase, allowing them to raise funds through community donations.
* **Eligibility Updates:**
  * No multiple project applications.
  * Projects selected for Retro Funding cannot apply for QF.
* **Expected Impact:** More equitable competition by removing mature projects that have dominated past QF rounds.

### Metrics-based Retro Funding (RF) ‚Üí High-Impact, Mature Projects

The metrics for voting will be based on the projects‚Äô success within their GG journey.

* **Curated selection** of **30 projects** identified by OSO based on historical GG impact, contribution to OSS, and sustained development.
* **Expected Value:**
  * A minimum ‚Äúfloor funding‚Äù will be active, ensuring projects in the Retro round are fairly funded outside of QF, taking into account average distribution that the top 30 projects have historically received in QF rounds.
* **Eligibility Criteria:**
  * Participated in multiple OSS rounds (GG18‚ÄìGG22).
  * Must opt-in after being shortlisted.

---

## Key Timelines

QF & Retro Applications: Mid March
QF Donations: Early April
Retro Voting kick off one week into the QF round.
![Screenshot 2025-02-12 at 14.23.49|690x189](upload://vXflvduTSC5qCNW2ZdBj49w0LkK.png)


* Applications for both QF & Retro Funding run simultaneously.
* QF Donations & Retro Voting periods overlap.
* Results and payouts announced at the same time.

*Exact dates will be announced shortly!*

---

## Badgeholders & Voting Structure for Retro Funding

We are implementing a tiered badgeholder system for voting on Retro Funding allocations. Each tier will be weighted appropriately, with ‚Äúexperts‚Äù weighted the highest in voting.

**Experts**
Gitcoin Stewards who‚Äôs ever had a significant amount delegated to them
Trusted Gitcoin contributors who have expertise in GG/OSS

**GTC Holders**
Anybody holding 2k+ GTC
*This is subject to change.*

**Donors**
Donors who have donated since GG18 with a minimum of $50 per round.
*This is subject to change.*

---

## Optimizing for Builder Retention & Ecosystem Growth

### KPIs for Success

**Builder Participation & Retention**
‚úÖ 45% retention rate of past Gitcoin grantees
‚úÖ 30% of funded projects are first-time participants
‚úÖ 80%+ builder satisfaction in post-round surveys

**Expanding & Evolving Funding Mechanisms**
‚úÖ Position GG23 as a testing ground for experimental funding
‚úÖ Ensure projects receive support beyond funding

**Ecosystem Growth**
‚úÖ Funds distributed across OSS categories (Web3 Infra, Dev Tooling, dApps & Apps)
‚úÖ Increase participation of new builders & communities

---

## Onboarding & Community Engagement

### Supporting Builders Beyond Funding

* **Onboarding Program:** Providing education and mentorship, through an RFP that the community will own once an application has been selected by the Gitcoin team.
* **Team Tiger:** Continuing to actively assist applicants throughout the process.
* **Funding Experiments:** Exploring predictive funding as complements to QF & Retro rounds, outlined in [this passed GCP](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gcp-xxx-predictive-funding-competition-for-gg23/19902).

---

## Community Rounds: Decentralization in Action

Community Rounds are a core expression of Gitcoin‚Äôs mission to empower communities to Fund What Matters, serving as a powerful, decentralized pillar of Gitcoin Grants. Since GG20, we‚Äôve witnessed a growing number of communities scaling their own ecosystems throughout 2024. As we move toward GG23, we‚Äôre proud to continue providing matching funds to those choosing to run their rounds alongside ours, reinforcing our commitment to community-driven funding.

* Community Rounds run on Grant Ships with new governance structures.
* Top 3 Community Rounds receive additional incentives and automatic eligibility for GG24.

More information on GG23 [Community Round eligibility](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg23-community-rounds-eligibility-criteria/19924) and the [application process](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg23-community-round-applications/19940).

**GG23** is a bold experiment in refining Quadratic Funding & Retro Funding to better serve builders. We don‚Äôt expect it to be perfect, but we are committed to learning and iterating alongside the community.

We‚Äôd love your feedback on how we can optimize engagement, voting, and funding allocation.

<p>Yes, the main purpose of this upgrade to the program was to improve the builder centric approach by segregating mature projects from early projects, this way the QF Distribution is fairer and mature projects doesn‚Äôt need to ‚Äúcompete‚Äù against early projects for funding.</p>

            <p>This sounds like magic<br>
Congratulations for all the participants and creators of this new initiative. I have some doubts, how as a community member and a grantee we can apply for Retro to our projects, if we are still in adolescence and a little far for maturity?</p>
