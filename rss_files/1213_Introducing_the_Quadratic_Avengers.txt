Introducing the Quadratic Avengers

    GM GM!

We are thrilled to introduce the **Quadratic Avengers** - a team of superheroes who have come together with a mission to address one of the most pressing challenges in any ecosystem: the lack of incentives for the average community member to contribute value.

In a world where innovation and progress depend on the collective efforts of individuals, we recognize the importance of rewarding those who dedicate their time and energy to make an ecosystem better. The Quadratic Avengers aim to enable different ecosystems to use Gitcoin Grants rounds to reward/fund people who are contributing to creating ecosystem value.

@koday and I are organizing these grant rounds from start to finish and we have @owocki as the fiscal sponsor and mentor for this endeavor. We believe that this initiative is just the beginning, and we hope to inspire other communities to follow suit.

The first step in our journey is launching **six mini-grant rounds during GG19** (GreenPill, Cult DAO, Shefi, Boys Club, Daily Gwei, FWB) each with a minimum funding of 2.5 ETH/$5,000.

By joining forces with these amazing communities, we aim to create a domino effect that will lead to even more grant rounds and opportunities for community members to thrive. In the immediate future, we expect to have more and more feedback for Grants Stack through this initiative. [More on this strategy here.](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/grants-stack-gateway-drug-sales-strategy/16681)
