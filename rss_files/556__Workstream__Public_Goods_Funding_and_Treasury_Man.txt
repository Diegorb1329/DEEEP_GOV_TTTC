https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-public-goods-funding-and-treasury-management/129
    Hey all! 

Over the last few years, Gitcoin has been building solutions around how we fund the public goods we care about, most successfully using [quadratic funding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06421), a novel mechanism designed by Vitalik, Glen Weyl, and Zoe Hitzig in 2018. 

The way this mechanism works is simple, projects in Ethereum can list themselves as public goods in need of funding, and participants can democratically allocate funds from a community managed matching pool by donating some of their own money. By its design, quadratic funding incentivizes every member of the community to fund the infrastructure they want to see in direct proportion to how useful it will be to them, providing a possible solution to our digital tragedy of the commons.

Given the interest we've seen so far from an amazing group of stewards, and some of the recent heated debate we've seen around what to do with [AKITA](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-what-should-the-gitcoin-community-multisig-do-with-the-donated-akita/67), I'd like to propose a workstream around how we think about best leveraging quadratic funding, and in particular how we decide some of the operational details of the Gitcoin Grants [matching rounds](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/02/round9.html) we run each quarter. 

Some ideas for what this workstream might address include:

* Best practices for managing the Gitcoin Grants matching pool and multisig by proposing round sizes, themes, and parameters for stewards to review and vote on
* Creating policy regarding what is/is not an acceptable grant (what counts as a public good?)
* Deciding on what a fair dispute resolution process for grants might look like
* Helping to manage the broader GitcoinDAO treasury and push forward positive-sum, multiplayer games through inter-DAO collabs like token swaps

If you already know this is a workstream you'd want to be part of and you've already stated your intent to be a steward [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-stewards-governance/41), just fill out this workstream-specific Doodle so we can find some time for a first call:

            <p>In my view, quadratic funding can become effective only with more awareness and participation. We need to think about the best media to reach the potential participants of quadratic funding. We need to think about practical policy options available to make the process of quadratic funding better, multistage process??<br>
Can we have access to the notes of the last workstream call? And when is the next Workstream call?</p>

            <p>Hi Everyone, I‚Äôm Manu originally from Venezuela (even though I don‚Äôt believe in imaginary lines). I‚Äôm a humanist, solarpunk, engineer and in crypto since 2016. I‚Äôm super interested in funding public goods as before I built together with +1800 persons and without raising a single USD apart from gitcoin donations, a social media website for helping during the pandemic, it was called <a href="https://fightpandemics.com/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">FightPandemics.com</a>, the idea was to launch a social DAO, but I realized that the majority of people don‚Äôt really grasp human and social capital and when I saw the rise of NFTs I realized that creators could potentially fund social causes that they care about and that‚Äôs how <a href="https://doingud.com/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">DoinGud</a> started. On DoinGud, every creation will have a social cause attached to it. I‚Äôd love to be part of this working group and co-create with you.</p>

            <p>Owocki is a fan of quadratic funding, but it has big deficiencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Many people do not know that they need Hilbert spaces theory or molecular biology very much, word processor users don‚Äôt know that they need a reliable optimizing compiler that is in turn may be based on dependent-types lambda-calculus research, etc. and they won‚Äôt fund it. Especially science and software libraries public goods suffer severe underfunding when funding quadratic, because every funder cannot know every science topic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When doing quadratic funding it inevitably goes much random - some projects are funded too much and some are severely underfunded (among other reasons, because well-funded projects can buy SEO of their ads).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anti-sybil is improving but it can‚Äôt be perfect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If some important text or software is buried on the 100000th position of Google, the world gets stuck: nobody knows that the missing component is a problem and therefore nobody fixes the problem.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, we need a much more objective mean of funding. Ideally funding amount should be calculated by an algorithm, not by stupid us.</p>
<p>We don‚Äôt yet have an algorithm capable to predict the future of the human work. The solution is to use a prediction market to predict a future algorithm results. So the market decides.</p>
<p>Traders (when motivated by money) are much more careful, hard working, and through than some random quadratic voter. Traders are therefore multitudinous that much reduces randomness and bias. They are to follow an objective algorithm that motivates them and so the market is striving for objective results.</p>
<p>So, I provide a software that ‚Äúforces‚Äù traders to ‚Äúcalculate‚Äù how much which project to fund.</p>
<p>There will appear a new profession: people that search for underrepresented public good projects and do SEO for them. That‚Äôs important.</p>
<p>It should be in addition to quadratic Grants. Users should have choice where to pay.</p>
<p>This software is almost fully implemented (and there is a little outdated pull request to integrate it into a GitCoin page).</p>
<p>The proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay for <em>quality</em> audit of the smart contracts.</li>
<li>Assign me to finish integrating it into GitCoin site.</li>
<li>Do a good design.</li>
<li>Deploy on production.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the PR and more details:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/issues/8183" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Integrate "future salaries" into GitCoin ¬∑ Issue #8183 ¬∑ gitcoinco/web ¬∑ GitHub</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/pull/8265" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Future Salaries system by vporton ¬∑ Pull Request #8265 ¬∑ gitcoinco/web ¬∑ GitHub</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We need both quadratic funding and this thing.</strong></p>
