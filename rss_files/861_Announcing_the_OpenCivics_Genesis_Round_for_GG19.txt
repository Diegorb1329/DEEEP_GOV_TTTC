    Gm gm, frens. 

This is Benjamin Life from [OpenCivics](https://opencivics.co) where I serve as co-founder and steward.

Weâ€™re launching OpenCivicsâ€™ first Community Round thanks to a generous matching pool donation of $25k from an aligned organization in the decentralized civics space. Our round is intended to fund a broad cross section of civic-related public goods within a highly curated selection of projects. One of the key innovations our round is experimenting with is a criteria of membership within the OpenCivics Consortium of civic innovators, creating higher degrees of collaborative synergy between public goods builders in the space. We believe that these contributions to the QF space (civic focus, highly curated projects, and consortium membership criteria) will be useful experiments for the entire Gitcoin community to explore variations in focal points and strategies for deploying the mechanism of quadratic funding.

Weâ€™re incredibly excited to be running a Community Round for the upcoming GG19 having been recipients ourselves in previous Web3 Community & Education and MetaCrisis rounds. Our round operators are myself and Patricia Parkinson of OpenCivics, Renee Davis of Talent DAO, and Clinamenic of DAO Coalition and JournoDAO. We deeply align with Gitcoinâ€™s Mission and weâ€™re excited to contribute to GG19 as a new sub-community focused on decentralized civics!
