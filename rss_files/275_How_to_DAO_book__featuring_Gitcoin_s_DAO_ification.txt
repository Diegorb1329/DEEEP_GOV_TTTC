Hey Gitcoin Community,

I‚Äôm thrilled to announce the launch of my new book, *How to DAO: Mastering the Future of Internet Coordination*! üéâ This book is a culmination of years of exploration, experimentation, and collaboration within the Web3 ecosystem, with a special spotlight on Gitcoin‚Äôs own journey of becoming a DAO.

In *How to DAO*, I detail how/why we've been progressively transforming from a centralized platform (Gitcoin Grants) to a decentralized autonomous organization (Gitcoin DAO), placing decision-making in the hands of the people who care most: you, the Gitcoin community. From initial brainstorming sessions to the launch of Gitcoin DAO in 2021, the book explores the challenges we faced, the lessons we learned, and the opportunities we unlocked along the way.

But this isn‚Äôt just a Gitcoin story‚Äîit‚Äôs about the digital frontier of DAO-ification we‚Äôre all building together. For generations, the frontier was a physical place, a land of discovery, self-actualization, and riches. Today, that frontier is digital. DAOs are enabling us to create abundance, build meaningful careers, and design systems that work for everyone.

This book is your guide to navigating that world. Whether you‚Äôre curious about joining a DAO, creating impact, earning a living, or exploring decentralized finance, *How to DAO* offers practical insights, real-world examples, and a clear roadmap for thriving in the next era of the internet.

I hope this book serves as both inspiration and a tool for spreading DAO literacy far and wide. By purchasing a copy and sharing it with your networks, you‚Äôre not only helping to grow this movement but also supporting Gitcoin‚Äôs mission of funding what matters and creating a regenerative Web3 future.

Let‚Äôs DAO-pill the mainstream! Grab a copy @ [http://howtodao.xyz](https://howtodao.xyz) and help us climb the Amazon Best Seller list. Together, we can reach critical mass and inspire more people to build a brighter, more decentralized future.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and how the book resonates with your own DAO adventures.
