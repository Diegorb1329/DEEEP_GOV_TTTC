https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/refactoring-gitcoin-what-falls-between-the-cracks/13026
    We‚Äôve come through a period of course correction as a DAO, and have seen a few major decisions recently taken: GPC is splitting into Passport and Allo Protocol. And FDD and DAOOps will dissolve, and S17 will be their final seasons.

While difficult, I see this as overall very positive. We‚Äôre re-orienting the DAO around the products. Plans are already in place to move our support, fraud, and data analysis functions into the product teams. And as [Kyle wrote up recently](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s17-musing-gitcoins-most-important-thing/12875?u=kevin.olsen), all of this allows us to center our work around our most important things.

These recent changes require additional work to be done to ensure operational continuity. Still, I‚Äôm confident that we have the right structures to enable us to continue to operate and evolve the DAO.

### Tension: where are we still likely to see work that falls through the cracks?

I think we have two areas of coordination that remain unaddressed in our DAO.

1. We are missing bottom-up ideation and participation. Outside of joining a workstream, there aren't low-barrier onramps where our community can step in and contribute to shaping gitcoin. We have a tremendous opportunity with @ceresstation 's [recent proposal](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-building-gitcoin-using-quadratic-funding-for-subtraction/13015?u=kevin.olsen) to use the Grant Stack to invite our community to participate in a regular cadence of Gitcoin building Gitcoin rounds. These rounds can enable much of the work with no home in the current or future workstreams. This would be a massive win in terms of shifting the budgeting work away from stewards, workstream leads, and the ‚Äòinsiders‚Äô into a public space that leverages our core product to do what it does best: elicit the will of the community to fund initiatives in a concave space.

2. From the other direction, we are missing the ability to execute on some narrower strategic areas, evidenced in our inability to move forward with revenue modeling, GTC utility, and similar deeply consequential but non-workstream specific tasks. I think these issues suffer from what Divya and Safron call ‚ÄúShared Stagnation: Sacrificing progress for participation‚Äù in their [CIP Whitepaper](https://cip.org/whitepaper). Gitcoin‚Äôs current issue is that even if we employed the best in class "sense and respond" governance techniques, we would have no individual who is accountable for getting this work done. As such, it languishes in any number of gov posts attempting to move this discussion forward. I believe we should reorient our approach and opt to have narrower accountability structures to solve this.

### Proposal: address the work that we‚Äôve been missing along two tracks:

1. A broad bottoms up effort to source and fund the jobs the community wants done, and to use our amazing collective intelligence superpower of quadratic funding to make that happen.

2. A narrow, top-down accountability setting that finds leaders in the DAO to take on specific mandate to deliver on key strategic issues (i.e. revenue modeling, and GTC utility).

For point 1, please do read [Scott‚Äôs proposal here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-building-gitcoin-using-quadratic-funding-for-subtraction/13015?u=kevin.olsen). I think this is nearly in the ‚Äòsafe enough to try‚Äô territory.

For point 2, my assumption is that the individuals leading these efforts would be sourced from the DAO Core team. We would expect these folks to post regular progress reports in the forum, to solicit involvement from experts inside and outside of our DAO, and to run these topics to ground in the form of proposals that are ratified via Snapshot vote. We‚Äôve had some precedent in the past for the top-down accountability with Kyle‚Äôs treasury diversification efforts. I‚Äôm of the opinion that the strategic work should follow a similar trajectory. Doing so would allow us to collectively remain focused on our most important things (Allo adoption and growth, and the Grant program), while still making progress on the topline strategic work that our existing team/responsibility structures have neglected. **The shift here is one of process: are we ok to stop the leaderless, deliberative, and stagnant approach to these topics and move to assigning team members the mandate to lead the generation and ratification of these solutions?**

To the group: Does this resonate? What are the risks and trade-offs that you see? What safeguards would you want in place to make this safe enough to try?

            <p>Only now getting to responding to this post. I agree with your outline and I think we are addressing these two issues with the two processes which are currently being developed within our DAO</p>

<p>This would be addressed through the GCP process, which is also currently being updated (more coming soon). I agree with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/shawn16400">@shawn16400</a>‚Äôs comments that it is not only a question of empowerment, but also of capacity. Through a well-defined GCP process (combined with requests for proposals, within this process), it will be easier for CSDO to delegate these crucial - and very high-context - topics to teams, whether they are part-time contributors or specialists outside of our DAO.</p>
<p>The combination of these two initiatives - and a clear delineation between both to indicate what process serves which outcomes and to avoid overlap and confusion- might help us break through the stagnation you described so well. Thanks for voicing this so well, a lot of this can further enrich the two processes which are being outlined, excited for what will come out of this!</p>

<p>Interesting, why I think MMM was so successful is that they had a mandate that allowed them to cut through and make a decision (and the MMM team are thoughtful brilliant people who built the whole thing in public). Branding falls squarely into their remit. This is more of an example of the workstream structure stepping in to provide the delegated authority that‚Äôs missing for these other topics.</p>

CSDO is too vested in their workstream outcomes to take the time for the holistic outcomes AND we don‚Äôt trust one person to do this because we don‚Äôt want a CEO.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is a great point, we might have leaders that are overloaded (I‚Äôve been there) but we also need to be building the next layer of accountability in our teams to free folks up to take this work on. If this is through internal promotion, or hiring in, we need to have the capacity for this work.</p>
<p>I would propose that it is less about organization capacity and more about a consensual process to give individuals that empowered outcome ownership. This is IMO classic agent/principle stuff, and I have some thoughts on why we have more agentic behavior over principle behavior in the DAO. Without solving that incentive misalignment though, I believe there are enough energetic and mission-aligned folks that we could progress topics if they were freed up to move through the work decisively.</p>

<p>We certainly chase the urgent here at Gitcoin, not always the Important (I am guilty of this too!). I appreciate the intention of naming the progress (and lack there of), but I wonder how we actually make room for this for the folks you are chatting about (top down)?</p>
<p>We already are getting heat about budgets being too large, and team sizes being too large, yet we find ourselves in a space where key folks are over burdened and under supported. I‚Äôm interested in determining how to empower more folks to own outcomes instead of staying idle and looking for direction.</p>
<p>This is a bit of a rant, but the number of times people have come out and said ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have a strategy!‚Äù but have done nothing to improve that situation is getting quite old. I actually wonder if the bottoms up approach may offer funding for experts to come in and pitch solutions to these problems.</p>
<p>Anyway, open to ideas on how we might take some first steps here.</p>

Refactoring Gitcoin: What falls between the cracks?

            <p>Thanks for putting this together, Kevin! Very thoughtful, and I couldn‚Äôt agree more.</p>
<p>Fully supportive of these efforts. In particular, I‚Äôd love us to double down on <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation">@ceresstation</a>‚Äôs recent post. Such an articulate post, and I think would be awesome for us to move forward with it.</p>
<p>Regarding the leadership piece, I couldn‚Äôt of said it better. Sense and respond is all good and fun in theory and small orgs, but with multiple products with thousands of active users, we need decisive and accountable leadership that deliver results.</p>
<p>In PGF, it‚Äôs been exciting to see folks take on more ownership and hold themselves accountable, and I‚Äôm optimistic this will spread throughout the DAO as we become new and improved in S17.</p>
<p>Onwards and upward!</p>

Refactoring Gitcoin: What falls between the cracks?

            <p>We‚Äôve come through a period of course correction as a DAO, and have seen a few major decisions recently taken: GPC is splitting into Passport and Allo Protocol. And FDD and DAOOps will dissolve, and S17 will be their final seasons.</p>
<p>While difficult, I see this as overall very positive. We‚Äôre re-orienting the DAO around the products. Plans are already in place to move our support, fraud, and data analysis functions into the product teams. And as <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s17-musing-gitcoins-most-important-thing/12875">Kyle wrote up recently</a>, all of this allows us to center our work around our most important things.</p>
<p>These recent changes require additional work to be done to ensure operational continuity. Still, I‚Äôm confident that we have the right structures to enable us to continue to operate and evolve the DAO.</p>

<p>I think we have two areas of coordination that remain unaddressed in our DAO.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We are missing bottom-up ideation and participation. Outside of joining a workstream, there aren‚Äôt low-barrier onramps where our community can step in and contribute to shaping gitcoin. We have a tremendous opportunity with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation">@ceresstation</a> 's <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-building-gitcoin-using-quadratic-funding-for-subtraction/13015">recent proposal</a> to use the Grant Stack to invite our community to participate in a regular cadence of Gitcoin building Gitcoin rounds. These rounds can enable much of the work with no home in the current or future workstreams. This would be a massive win in terms of shifting the budgeting work away from stewards, workstream leads, and the ‚Äòinsiders‚Äô into a public space that leverages our core product to do what it does best: elicit the will of the community to fund initiatives in a concave space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the other direction, we are missing the ability to execute on some narrower strategic areas, evidenced in our inability to move forward with revenue modeling, GTC utility, and similar deeply consequential but non-workstream specific tasks. I think these issues suffer from what Divya and Safron call ‚ÄúShared Stagnation: Sacrificing progress for participation‚Äù in their <a href="https://cip.org/whitepaper">CIP Whitepaper</a>. Gitcoin‚Äôs current issue is that even if we employed the best in class ‚Äúsense and respond‚Äù governance techniques, we would have no individual who is accountable for getting this work done. As such, it languishes in any number of gov posts attempting to move this discussion forward. I believe we should reorient our approach and opt to have narrower accountability structures to solve this.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>
<a name="proposal-address-the-work-that-weve-been-missing-along-two-tracks-2" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#proposal-address-the-work-that-weve-been-missing-along-two-tracks-2"></a>Proposal: address the work that we‚Äôve been missing along two tracks:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A broad bottoms up effort to source and fund the jobs the community wants done, and to use our amazing collective intelligence superpower of quadratic funding to make that happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A narrow, top-down accountability setting that finds leaders in the DAO to take on specific mandate to deliver on key strategic issues (i.e. revenue modeling, and GTC utility).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For point 1, please do read <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-building-gitcoin-using-quadratic-funding-for-subtraction/13015">Scott‚Äôs proposal here</a>. I think this is nearly in the ‚Äòsafe enough to try‚Äô territory.</p>
<p>For point 2, my assumption is that the individuals leading these efforts would be sourced from the DAO Core team. We would expect these folks to post regular progress reports in the forum, to solicit involvement from experts inside and outside of our DAO, and to run these topics to ground in the form of proposals that are ratified via Snapshot vote. We‚Äôve had some precedent in the past for the top-down accountability with Kyle‚Äôs treasury diversification efforts. I‚Äôm of the opinion that the strategic work should follow a similar trajectory. Doing so would allow us to collectively remain focused on our most important things (Allo adoption and growth, and the Grant program), while still making progress on the topline strategic work that our existing team/responsibility structures have neglected. <strong>The shift here is one of process: are we ok to stop the leaderless, deliberative, and stagnant approach to these topics and move to assigning team members the mandate to lead the generation and ratification of these solutions?</strong></p>
<p>To the group: Does this resonate? What are the risks and trade-offs that you see? What safeguards would you want in place to make this safe enough to try?</p>
