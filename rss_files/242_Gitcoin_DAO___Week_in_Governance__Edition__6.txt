Gitcoin DAO - Week in Governance, Edition #6
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-dao-week-in-governance-edition-6/8161
    This weekly post has the ambition to summarise what‚Äôs been going on in the Gitcoin DAO Governance. Topics, ideas, proposals, and votes will be listed with links for further reading and discussion. If there‚Äôs anything missing please reach out! üìù

### [ü§ñ Meta-Governance](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/governance-meta/6)

* The third Gitcoin Monthly Steward sync was held on August 2. @Anett provided the [agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dpC8bLbi2BvY3Uq_ggQOaTCsorgAV593K3AoO1isVIU/edit) and [notes](https://hackmd.io/@Bnkhqf0tSbi1lX2Xc-WXYQ/BJdxmNB1F) from the call. A recording is coming through soon!

* The [DAO calendar](http://addevent.com/calendar/pz351122) continues to be updated with relevant workstream events, if you see anything missing please suggest it!

* @Anett proposed an [initiative](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-stewards-unconference-chats/8112) that was brought up on the Stewards call #3: ‚ÄúThe idea to host unconference sessions is to meet stewards & friends and have informal chats together, share memes, share whatever we want. The outcome should be to build relationships as the DAO moves faster when people know each other and it helps create a more friendly atmosphere.‚Äù

* Illustrations were added to the [v1 governance post](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-dao-governance-process-v1/7860/18) and a new mapping of the GitcoinDAO ecosystem was [published](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/ecosystem-mapping-discussion/8123) by @Zargham. ‚ÄúThe goal of this document is to provide a preliminary mapping of the critical operational functions of the GitcoinDAO pursuant to GitcoinDAO‚Äôs stated purpose, and in particular the interplays between the various stakeholders.‚Äù

* The [budget proposal](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/public-goods-funding-workstream-budget-request/7993) for the Public Goods Funding Workstream has been put to [vote](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/QmQWucgbue8uemNHXTDKvvEhRxfEcoB6B6Ci51TANkKaGU) and passed, making it the first workstream allocation confirmed by stewards.

* The [vote](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/Qmf8du3yfvYvFsXRDQHfUMvafFBAMWb2ujC6KjWQZ8Mqky) to ratify the ‚ÄúoneGTC: A $GTC Backed Economy‚Äù-proposal did not pass. The [proposal thread](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gtc-backed-economy/8033/) has received a lot of feedback and input from the community. Yalor [closed](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gtc-backed-economy/8033/33) the topic as the deadline for the voted passed.

* @Sirlupinwatson hosted a [call](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-proposal-draft-mini-grants-community-events-discovery-of-the-quadratics-lands/7942/13) on possible ways to improve the Gitcoin community with a discussion around the Mini Grants Community Events [proposal](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-proposal-draft-mini-grants-community-events-discovery-of-the-quadratics-lands/7942).

* The discussion of a Second Claim Window for $GTC was [closed](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-second-claim-window-for-gtc/7388/73) by @Yalor due to inactivity.
