https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/weekly-grants-2-0-update-2022-6-7/10835
    Grants 2.0 is an open-source technology for plural and scalable public goods provision. We are building a modular toolkit for Quadratic Funding and adjacent social incentive designs to increase and govern ecosystem capital.

# 2022/6/7 Update

## Highlights
* This week is launch week for Passport - which means this week was spent shipping a ton of UI/UX changes. In terms of MVP, completing the last stamp (BrightID) marked the completion of MVP. Additionally, we have code up for a Reader on gitcoin.co/trust to give users a Trust Bonus Score. Does it feel done - like we’ve crossed some sort of line? No, not at all. The feedback we’ve been gathering has provided us plenty of UI/UX improvements. It’s helped us validate our assumptions on some problems, and invalidate what we thought were problems elsewhere. It’s helped us discover more about the value we’re providing to our users, and how we can provide more.
* Grants Hub is targeting to be dev-complete with Grant Hub MVP by Friday, June 3rd. With this week’s progress, we are about 90% of the way to hitting our MVP milestone. Our goal is to have Grants Hub production-ready by July 1st, 2022. 
* This week the Round Manager / Explorer team finished fleshing out the contract structure and tested deploying it to Goerli using some helper scripts we’ve written. We also created a basic UI shell for the [Round Manager Steel Thread](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOyDFRMM=/?share_link_id=589961971819) — this currently allows you to connect a wallet, but next week we will begin wiring the contracts up and adding more functionality to the UI.

<p>great to see these demo videos. imo this is a much better way to traverse this info than a long list of text updates.</p>
<p>would love to see others in the DAO watching these demos + giving feedback, given how grants 2.0 is an essential intent for the dao</p>
