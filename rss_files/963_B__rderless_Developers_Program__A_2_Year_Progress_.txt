B<>rderless Developers Program (A 2 Year Progress Report 2022 -2024)
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/b-rderless-developers-program-a-2-year-progress-report-2022-2024/17962
    Hello Gitcoiners🙋🏽‍♀️, I'm Karla Obakpolor, [aka KarlaGod](https://twitter.com/_karlagod), I'm the Founder of [Crypto Smart,](https://cryptosmartnow.io/) and Lead Partner at [B<>rder/ess](https://borderless.cryptosmartnow.io/), and here's my story and the progress report of my contribution to Public Goods in web3.

[I started my company Crypto Smart in 2021](https://youtu.be/-YABEgRtJj0?si=NYfaHFcA_ahNGlqU), as an asset management company to help people in my country get into crypto, smartly, without losing their money to volatility or bad timing in the Crypto Market, r from treating Crypto like a Ponzi.

Our strategy was one of research, educate then act. So we'd research what Crypto Assets to buy, educate our clients on what to expect with market volatility, and then how to buy them, how to protect their wallets, etc.

We never held client assets, we mostly educated and advised clients, we also helped businesses set up trading departments in their institutions.

As time went by I also wanted to build a Blockchain Product that could help clients do this without having to go through the manual processes of signing up with us, booking a meeting, etc. I wanted us to build different dApps that cater to savings needs, DeFi Education needs and Crypto Asset management needs.

I quickly found out that there was a dearth of web3 developers in my environment, most devs didn't understand or even like web3, and some others weren't interested in it at all because they had lost money to crypto and didn't understand that Blockchain and Crypto were 2 different things.

It took me 6 months to get developers who were interested in exploring web3 and teach them to work in a team together and to understand dev tooling in web3. By the end of those 6 months, I thought to myself, *"What if I do this same thing that we've done internally for Crypto Smart, externally?"*, and at that time my CTO [Primidac](https://twitter.com/primidac) had decided that he would be willing to teach other young people, and this decision we both made was the catalyst for establishing B<>rder/ess.

So B<>rder/ess is the Tech Not-For-Profit arm of Crypto Smart, and Crypto Smart allocates 25% of her resources to make sure B<>rder/ess runs.

***And that's how I got into Public Goods - ......by mistake :rofl:***
