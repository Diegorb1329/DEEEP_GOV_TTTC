### Allo + Grants Stack:

* Allo brand is coming to fruition! Core brand elements have been delivered and can be found [here](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Allo-Brand-Design-Assets-1b6372032fcf434da3961bc3591261e6), including logo, color and typography.

* The focus has shifted to supporting the development of Allo v2, while the documentation work is paused until further progress.

* Endaoment Integration for QF is expected to go live on June 29th. Also, they integrated GTC as a token, enabling donor-advised funds to hold up to 50k GTC to receive and make donations.

[Drip campaign](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18N9a01O1iCUQ9enyt8nQubBvj4TLOJ5BejVhoMCyGfQ/edit#) starting next week!
