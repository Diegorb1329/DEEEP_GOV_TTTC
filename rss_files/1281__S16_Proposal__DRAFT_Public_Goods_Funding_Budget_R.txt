# Essential Intents

During S16, we will continue to prioritize the following EIs

- EI1: Protocol Adoption
- EI2: Financial Sustainability 
- EI3: DAO Organization
- EI4: Grants Program Success

# TL;DR

In S16, PGF will prioritize collaborating with other workstreams across the DAO to test an alpha round of our grants program on the protocol.

Based on what we learned in Season 15, we are shifting our priorities to the protocol to ensure success at launch and not risk being torn between prioritizing running a round on c-grants and transitioning partners to the protocol. We saw this happen in S15, where during and after the round we had no way to continue pushing the protocol forward because 150% of our attention was on holding together our round on c-grants, a platform that has been in maintenance mode for many rounds and has accrued a lot of tech and process debt. As a result, we want to take all our learnings from running grants to date and shift our focus to the protocol, this will include re-thinking the eligibility policy requirements, designing robust processes, operations, and services to easily scale protocol rounds all while testing and delivering alpha rounds on the protocol in S16 (namely 2-3 design partner rounds and a as an alternative to GR16 we’ll be running an alpha test round on the protocol).

In S16 we will prioritize our team’s time around transitioning to the protocol and ensuring we’re attentive to our partners and grantees needs to guarantee a successful transition. To help operationalize this, we will also build out a services arm of PGF to further accommodate instances of the protocol. During S16 we will bring on a services lead full-time to help define, operationalize and execute this services arm. The abridged goal is to increase our internal capacity to meet the ongoing needs of design partners as we help serve their unique instances of the protocol. If successful in S16, PGF will run a few design partner rounds and an alpha Gitcoin test round for 2-3 focus areas on the protocol in January as a replacement of GR16.

# Amount

PGF is requesting $868,750 for S16. This is a 30% increase from S15. Notably the increase is due to a developer relations budget (requested by GPC for us to take on) that will ensure protocol launch success, a new senior hire as a services lead, and a retreat for core Web3 ecosystem community leaders that have either been key supporters of Gitcoin or key figures in the community to rally around the  Grants Protocol launch announcement during EthDenver. 

When accounting for reserves, our total request will be $978,050, an 8% decrease from last season.

***1)** The amount of GTC requested and the value of the reserves will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally using the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average, whichever is lower.*

***2)** The Treasury Request amount is an estimate using the price of $2.00 GTC to calculate the total of the reserves rolled over from Season 15.*

            <p>Thanks for sharing your honest perspective <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/griff">@griff</a>.<br>
<a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/lefterisjp">@lefterisjp</a> I appreciate your disappointment.</p>
<p>To address the overall sentiment I’m hearing above, which I will summarize as: PGF is not being thoughtful or strategic enough given the market and seemingly requesting way too much for what we’re delivering.</p>
<p>Your concerns are appreciated and are not landing on deaf ears. While our budget has passed, I realize we had the least support of all workstreams and this is good room for reflection.</p>
<p>I am hopeful that our approach as a team in S16 both in what we deliver and in how we spend our budget will help address many of the above concerns and reflect some of the requests expressed.</p>

            <p>Hi Griff, quick answers here for the retreat. To note it’s 125K total (not per month).<br>
2a: Sponsorships will go back to the DAO to cover the payment to our workstream.<br>
2b: Each workstream has been working on keeping a percentage of their workstream tokens in stables and are working with the DAO to make sure event funds are paid out in stables. We will also be ticketing for the event and a portion of the ticket price will be in fiat. Ideally we’ll be able to use these fiat funds to go directly to covering expenses. however, we can’t rely on people buying tickets at the perfect time for payments, hence the portion in stables.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span class="hashtag-raw">#3</span></strong> How is PGF going to cut costs in the future?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely, the total costs in this budget are an outlier and we don’t expect the next budget to hit this level. I think 30% is even pretty feasible. One thing that I’ll note is that it is harder for us to cut budgets in part because we are still really getting a handle on what we can / cannot distribute in terms of operational work to other teams. Now that cross-DAO functions are improving it’s a lot easier to start having those conversations, and moving grassroots over to MMM was a key part of that. In S17, devrel for example will be another area that we no longer own. We ultimately always want to maintain a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noXPewi5qOk&amp;ab_channel=EthereumFoundation" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">subtraction mindset </a>.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I am not convinced with this response sadly. I think this is the most important work stream for Gitcoin’s success. Funding the matching pool is what has given us so much success IMO.</p>
<p>But we need to make cuts and I don’t think any work stream is taking this seriously, so the only way the stewards can signal it is by voting no.</p>
<p>I am voting no on all work streams until we get our spending under control. It is the only thing I can do at this point, and I hope other Stewards will follow suit. We have given strong warnings over the last few seasons and they don’t seem to be enough.</p>
<p>We cannot spend this much money in this market, it is a bad strategy.</p>
<p>I am happy to work with the Gitcoin Hiring team to explain how Giveth finds intrinsically motivated high caliber contributors in lower income countries to keep our budget at 1/10th of the cost.</p>

lefterisjp

            <p>First of all I would like to recognize that PGF, next to GPC is an important workstream for the future of gitcoin. So I would really like to see it execute on its goals.</p>
<p>But I have to echo what virtually everyone else has noted which is a great concern to me. This year we have had two really serious events, last one of which was just last week, which have impacted the crypto ecosystem severely and thrown us even deeper into a bear market with no end in sight.</p>
<p>All major tech companies are having layoffs in the 20-50% of their entire workforce.</p>
<p>And the PGF workstream is requesting a huge amount of money for this season. An increase in funding from the previous ones! This is absolutely crazy.</p>
<p>I would really like to see a very aggressive attempt in cutting costs as I said last season. And seeing the opposite is dissapointing. More than half a million in $USD for salaries? $126k for a retreat? Does the retreat really need to happen under these marketr conditions? Is there really no way to cut this budget?</p>
<p>I am going to vote abstain until I get a more clear view of a future where I can see that the PGF workstream can rein in on its spending. I really wanted to vote yes, but I can’t do so yet. Please <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation">@ceresstation</a> help me here.</p>

            <p><i>Brand new Steward, lacking context. Apologies if questions and comments are naive while I get my footing</i></p><i>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I see that you are accounting for a DevRel expense in your budget increase by $176,000 as requested by GPC—however the GPC S16 budget also requested 36k for an outsourced DevRel contractor. Is this work being shared across work streams, and how do the two budget requests differ/reconcile? <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation">@ceresstation</a>’s breakdown of the $176,000 is a helpful start!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am interested <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/safder">@safder</a>’s concern about hiring a ‘Services Lead’. It would seem like a necessary hire if you plan to entirely remove c-grants from S16 as one would expect the need for a lot of ‘hand-holding’ while we transition to a new model. I do agree that anyone who fills this role should be a previous contributor to c-grants that already deeply understands the process. Would be very interested in learning more about this role &amp; the services you plan to provide to future grantees &amp; protocol users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The debate around compensation and equal Contributor salaries across work streams is an important one. Is there any evidence that unequal contributor salaries disincentivized work across other workstreams, or that without these compensation levels PGF is unable to find quality talent? Are these salaries being matched to industry standards or similar roles held elsewhere?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</i><p>Appreciate all the information and context everyone has provided—looking forward to see PGF execute on this roadmap <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p>All great questions <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/griff">@griff</a> and FWIW I agree with you that we should definitely look at cutting the budget in the future, and part of this will come from essentially time delaying comp via lock ups.</p>
<p>Right now this is just a critical time and one of the things we’re trying to do is make sure we are as prepared as possible for the launch coming up in Q1. In that context, I wanted to push back on some of the comments above to make sure the team can focus on really delivering on what we promise.</p>
<p>Now, onto the specific questions!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span class="hashtag-raw">#1</span></strong> I don’t understand the need to hire externally for these roles:<br>
Grant Services Lead (TBD)<br>
Grants Round Account Manager (TBD)<br>
Why can’t these roles can be sourced from inside the team, and we can cut scope on their other priorities? Surely the best people for these roles are probably already on the team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think we actually do ultimately want these to be sourced from somewhere in the DAO, but we still have to budget for them even if costs will be cut elsewhere. In both cases we have leads for the roles that are within and outside the DAO.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span class="hashtag-raw">#2</span></strong> I am a bit confused on the 125k for the event… What happens if the sponsors don’t show up? What happens to the money if they do? Will the sponsorship money come back to the DAO, or does it roll over some how? The money for the event will need to be liquidated, so it should be paid out to this WG in stables I assume?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/j9leger">@J9leger</a> kind of mentioned this and it was discussed again with agreement in CSDO, but essentially in an ideal world (and I don’t think it’s unrealistic as a target) every cost will be accounted for and recovered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span class="hashtag-raw">#3</span></strong> How is PGF going to cut costs in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely, the total costs in this budget are an outlier and we don’t expect the next budget to hit this level. I think 30% is even pretty feasible. One thing that I’ll note is that it is harder for us to cut budgets in part because we are still really getting a handle on what we can / cannot distribute in terms of operational work to other teams. Now that cross-DAO functions are improving it’s a lot easier to start having those conversations, and moving grassroots over to MMM was a key part of that. In S17, devrel for example will be another area that we no longer own. We ultimately always want to maintain a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noXPewi5qOk&amp;ab_channel=EthereumFoundation" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">subtraction mindset</a>.</p>

[S16 Proposal] DRAFT Public Goods Funding Budget Request
griff

            <p>I think the PGF team is the team that is most responsible for the success of Gitcoin. Fundraising is hard and getting groups to commit millions to be matched is amazing.</p>
<p>That said, I might need one of those phone calls from <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/j9leger">@J9leger</a> to feel good about this proposal.</p>
<p>The salaries here are just too high. We are a Public Goods project and can find intrinsically motivated aligned individuals from lower income countries that will be stoked to work for 1/3rd of this rate, then we can give them raises as they succeed, and still be solid.</p>
<p>I appreciate that the payments are in GTC… which makes me feel somewhat better about the amounts… but are there lock ups for the GTC? The amounts are just sooooo high!</p>
<p>This post sums up some of my concerns pretty well:</p>

<p>This proposal is asking for $868,750 which = 579,167 GTC (if GTC is $1.50)… That is about 4% of the circulating supply, being spent on just this working group for the next 3 months. If that hits the open market, that is a huge amount of inflation, and this is just one working group!</p>
<p>This is really scary to me…</p>
<p><strong>I have 2 small concerns that are probably easily addressed:</strong></p>
<p><strong><span class="hashtag-raw">#1</span></strong> I don’t understand the need to hire externally  for these roles:<br>
Grant Services Lead (TBD)<br>
Grants Round Account Manager (TBD)</p>
<p>Why can’t these roles can be sourced from inside the team, and we can cut scope on their other priorities? Surely the best people for these roles are probably already on the team.</p>
<p><strong><span class="hashtag-raw">#2</span></strong> I am a bit confused on the 125k for the event… What happens if the sponsors don’t show up? What happens to the money if they do? Will the sponsorship money come back to the DAO, or does it roll over some how? The money for the event will need to be liquidated,  so it should be paid out to this WG in stables I assume?</p>
<p><strong>I have one serious concern that will be difficult to address</strong></p>

</aside>
<p>I think this team is doing incredible work, but honestly there seems to be some head in the sand issues with the DAO overall. Cutting costs is critical right now. Many stewards have said this, but nothing is happening.</p>
<p>I can’t vote for nearly 1 Mil of spending for this group for just 3 months, without at least some sort of plan in place to reduce spending in the future by at least 30% next season and ideally more the season after.</p>
<p>I know it sounds harsh, but Giveth has a fantastic donation platform and has a burn rate of around 120k a month… nearly a million for 3 months for just one work stream is hard to swallow.</p>
<p>Can you commit to cutting costs for S17?</p>

            <p>Supportive of the PGF budget although I agree with some of the hesitations expressed by <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/safder">@safder</a>.<br>
I’ve read up on the above comments and replies and hope as well that some of the planned costs will be lower or recovered through sponsoring. In the context of the ‘light’ budget approach as decided in CSDO and combined with the earlier live session we had to review the draft commitments and budget I’ve gathered enough feedback to vote yes here.</p>

            <p>Grateful to <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/j9leger">@J9leger</a> for reaching out to help clear up some of my concerns on a call yesterday. It helped bring clarity to some of my main concerns:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is agreement that we probably shouldn’t use this full Devrel budget to hire someone at $400+k/year, and a commitment to ensuring that these funds roll over and can be used to continue to support these efforts in future seasons. I’ve shared my opinion that hiring someone at that cost would be a failure in recruitment, and I’m confident that we can find a very strong candidate with a much lower amount.</li>
<li>On the retreat, our conversation helped  me better understand the purposes and costs associated with the event and why a multi-day retreat makes more sense than a 1-day event. Some insight into the structure also gave me some confidence that this will in fact help develop Gitcoin’s brand/protocol adoption among key partners rather than just being a fun/vibey weekend. I still hope that the majority of these funds end up being covered by sponsors, and that a big chunk of this ~120k can be used to support future seasons.</li>
<li>PGF has recently gone through the exercise of increasing accountability and decreasing costs across its staffing, and is committed to continuing to maintain strong standards in this realm. This work is ongoing, and I have confidence in this team’s ability to deliver on high expectations here.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall while I still believe the ask of ~$870k is excessive, the understanding that a significant portion of this amount will be used to cover upfront overheads/costs that will be recuperated and further tightened throughout the season gives me some confidence that we won’t be draining our treasury as quickly in future seasons.</p>
<p>This definitely help resolve some of the dissonance I felt upon initial impressions here, and I’m hopeful that we’ll continue to see increased transparency and commitment to responsible stewardship of treasury funds from this team. Very much appreciate the thoughtful engagement and learning that has come out of this conversation, and looking forward to a great Season 16!</p>

            <p>I’ve been following the conversation and the points made back and forth here. While I share some skepticism around salary amounts and a couple other points <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/safder">@safder</a> brings up, I don’t have the conviction to bring them here. (yet???)</p>
<p>I would like to address this part.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don’t doubt that this is a valuable initiative, and I supported this in the CSDO vote mentioned. The proposal didn’t mention a cost of ~$120k, or any cost at all for that matter - it was posed as mostly free/minimal commitment from the DAO and that PGF wouldn’t even have to spend any time organizing this (it’s mostly organized by external supporters) - which is why I’m taken aback seeing this huge number. If we don’t end up raising any sponsorship money, $100k+ is too big of an amount I’d be comfortable supporting. One approach here could be that if we don’t raise enough money from sponsors, we downsize this from a multi-day retreat to a single-day event that costs no more than $25k</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I was not in sticker shock here. Perhaps I heard through different conversations, but I did expect the $120k price tag with the hope that we would recoup most.</p>
<p>The important thing for me is that this protocol launch is a big deal. Spending $25k in an effort to execute the retreat plan as cheap as possible isn’t it for me. Getting our partners, funders, and community supporters to truly understand what the protocol/program can do to benefit them is a top priority worth a significant amount of funding. We are lucky to be in a position where it may be possible to recoup the expense, but this is not the event we should take shortcuts in execution.</p>
<p>In the case it was not fully recouped, I still think this initiative is worth it’s weight as a strong signal to the community that we are interested in the Principle of Subtraction and THEY are the critical variable in creating a flourishing Gitcoin ecosystem.</p>

One approach here could be that if we don’t raise enough money from sponsors, we downsize this from a multi-day retreat to a single-day event that costs no more than $25k - this is more than enough to host a well-organized 1-day event, and is also a more realistic amount to raise from sponsors. It’s not like expected returns/support gained for the protocol launch increases proportionally to the lavishness of the event. Again, it feels like there’s a serious disconnect between this budget and prevailing sentiment of doing more with less/higher accountability across the rest of the DAO.</p>
<p>On (4) - I received some additional context on this from other contributors, and I do now support the hiring for this role (granted I’m not sure if it the salary of $180-200k is justified). I think more reasonable numbers across the budget would also make this feel more digestible.</p>
<p>I feel like a broken record on this point haha, but this team and the general direction of this budget are excellent and have my full support. There’s a strong dissonance between how much I trust this team and my disagreement with the numbers proposed. I don’t think I’m the only steward who feels this, and I hope we can work together on resolving this dissonance in subsequent seasons.</p>

            <p>Thank you <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/safder">@safder</a> for the question and <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation">@ceresstation</a> for your thoughtful responses here. I second everything said.<br>
The two main areas I’ll add some extra info around are:<br>
3) retreat: <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation">@ceresstation</a> covered all the necessary points here but to reiterate that the vote by CSDO explicitly called out that we will move forward with this and try bring in sponsors and set ticket prices but don’t want covering these costs for a 100+ person event to shift focus and detract from launching the protocol vs be additive. I believe this will be a major value add to deepening connections with our community and not only building stronger support for our protocol launch but also be a real schelling point for collaboration between others in our ecosystem.<br>
4) Services will be a large part of our protocol future and one clear avenue to an essential intent of ours around financial sustainability. We have many partners and we’re going to be shifting our grants program model to allow anyone at any time to run a round. This is vastly different to our current quarterly only cadence. Supporting anyone who wants to run a round so we build to our goal of 1000s of communities using our protocol and deliver on our essential intent of grants protocol adoption and growth, should be a priority.<br>
5) Heard on the DevRel perspective <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/safder">@safder</a> and will consider these thoughts.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the time put into this discussion everyone. Really looking forward to S16.</p>

            <p>For sure, those are all reasonable concerns. That said, I think we’ll have to agree to disagree on the value created vs. the cost of delivery at the end of the day. I’m always down to keep the conversation going and really appreciate the candid feedback though.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the success of PGF will be measured on its ability to raise funds for public goods and its ability to help other ecosystems fund their shared needs at scale, and I hope that the team can prove itself over time by delivering on this mission.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think the concern then becomes (1) This is still a significantly higher average than the rest of the DAO (work stream leads in other parts of the DAO are making less than this, and this is also higher than a team of highly experienced engineers), and (2) It doesn’t feel like the value created is enough to justify this spending.</p>
<p>I don’t think continuing to dig into the other pieces here will be very fruitful but however you slice it, this budget does feel a bit frivolous and like it’s not demonstrating the same level of accountability/intentionality in spending as we need in this moment (and as other budgets better reflect).</p>
<p>Again, I fully support this team and all your work + direction - it’s the cost + justification for needing the amount requested that doesn’t make a lot of sense.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>Considering many of these 13 contributors are part-time, the average would actually be closer to $200k or more for a full-time role - this doesn’t seem on-par with the rest of the DAO or the space in general.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All contributors noted there are full time with the exception of Madison, so you could maybe use 12.5 instead of 13 I suppose which would be closer to ~170k on average. On GTC, while DAO Ops is compensated entirely in GTC IIRC, GPC and others are distributed stables.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On (3), the discussion at CSDO assumed that most (if not all) of the cost of this event would be covered by sponsors. I think the decision might have been different if we were asking for $100k+ from the treasury for this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Happy to revisit this in a future CSDO call but I do think in general the DAO was aware that costs would be in this range, IIRC a ballpark was noted and <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/j9leger">@J9leger</a> asked if folks were comfortable with the risk of funding not being fully covered by the sponsorships in the failure case (with the goal being to fully cover). The notes from that call can provide more context.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From what I understand, the salaries noted (including in the posting you’ve shared) include token rewards - there’s no reason a company would advertise a significantly lower salary in a job posting than the total compensation they are actually offering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>UMA notes that “packages include competitive salaries <strong>&amp; substantial token options</strong>” and that “salaries range from $100-200K… while token allocations can grow with your voting rewards.” I think their goal is to set expectations going in on base comp while additional comp is potentially more flexible. Of course, we don’t currently offer any similar kinds of options.</p>
<p>In any case, I do know devrel leads that have total comp up to $400k. If you’d like I’m happy to connect you although I do want to avoid doxxing them publicly. For completeness I definitely hope comp ends closer to ~$200k total (in which case the remainder will be held over for future devrel budgets) and I’m certainly not negotiating against us, but I also believe we should be prepared to hire the best person for the job when it comes to such a critical role.</p>

<p>From what I understand most, if not all other DAO contributors are also compensated entirely in GTC (this is definitely true of DAO Ops).</p>
<p>On (3), the discussion at CSDO assumed that most (if not all) of the cost of this event would be covered by sponsors. I think the decision might have been different if we were asking for $100k+ from the treasury for this.</p>
<p>Thanks for the additional context on (4)! This helps me better understand the need for this role - again would want to make sure their compensation makes sense though ($200k for this role seems excessive at first glance). I would consider this point resolved though.</p>

[S16 Proposal] DRAFT Public Goods Funding Budget Request

            <p>Thanks for the comments <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/safder">@safder</a>, happy to address in short and then other folks from the team can add details where helpful.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Regarding salary payments, the math leads to an average salary of ~$165k on a mostly senior team (FWIW there are 3+ members of the team that are paid more than me so I’m not speaking for myself here). This team is generally responsible for the only fund-generating activity within the DAO and importantly, everyone is currently compensated entirely in GTC which deviates from the norm across workstreams / reduces the burden on treasury. In future we’re planning to introduce delayed token grants to further align incentives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is true, but we are also taking on devrel + scaling up services in anticipation of the protocol launch. We removed grassroots because we wanted to align our efforts more with MMM and this has been going well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’ll let <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/j9leger">@J9leger</a> speak more to the retreat costs but to be sure the decision to run this event was ratified in CSDO and was discussed across DAO leadership generally before being put into the budget. Costs here are for up to 150 community members and partners to really engage with us prior to protocol launch, which would lead to an average cost of about ~$600 per person with an additional budget left over for ETHDenver and related travel. For SP <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/azeem">@azeem</a> and the partnerships team intend to bring in sponsors to cover costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The services lead would work closely with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/j9leger">@J9leger</a> <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/azeem">@azeem</a> and the rest of the workstream to execute on the tactical / operational needs of partners + to leverage their existing industry context to reenforce / redirect our strategy as needed as we roll things out. Gitcoin has <em>many</em> partners and it’ll be important for us to hand hold them as they get spun up. In a world where we’re running 20+ rounds that are all serviced by the team, I think we’d be making a mistake not to have this role filled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One thing that isn’t being accounted for in Polygon’s compensation is that it also likely contains some kind of token arrangement, which we currently don’t offer. Instead, we’re <em>blending</em> comp as noted in (1). If you look at roles like <a href="https://cryptocurrencyjobs.co/engineering/uma-head-of-developer-relations/">this one</a> they explicitly mention this, although most posts won’t / generally won’t mention salary publicly at all.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks again for the thoughts here and happy to dive in further!</p>

            <p>Very much appreciate the work PGF is doing and have been very impressed by the quick pivot this team has made to focusing on Protocol-oriented initiatives.<br>
However this budget request intuitively seems very high to me, for a number of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Close to $550k for 13 contributors, some of which are part-time seems much higher than the average spend on salaries - this raises some flags for me also given the amounts being budgeted for new hires.</li>
<li>There is no longer a Grassroots team, which is a $100k expense removed from this team’s budget.</li>
<li>The amount of $126k budgeted for 3 months of traveling and a SP Retreat seems extremely high - are contributors flying business class? How much of this is for the SP Retreat, and if it’s a very high amount then is this what the DAO needs right now?</li>
<li>I’m not convinced that a “Services Lead” hire makes a lot of sense  - I would love for this work to be done collaboratively by some of the existing PGF contributors (feels like there should be some bandwidth here), maybe along with other work streams, since the services model includes other work streams. I do believe there is an appetite and existing bandwidth that can be leveraged for cross-stream collaboration on this. Hiring a new external person to figure out our entire business model and deliver on the outcomes listed here doesn’t feel like the best course of action.</li>
<li>As a People Ops professional who has been following tech salaries for 4+ years, the numbers <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation">@ceresstation</a> shared above for the DevRel + Services Lead hire seem highly inflated, which also makes me wonder if we’re also not overpaying on existing salaries. Where is PGF getting salary data from? <a href="https://web3.career/devrel-lead-europe-polygon/33820" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Here</a> is a posting for DevRel lead by Polygon with a range of $90-200k (important to note Polygon has a lot more money to play with than we do), and other data also points to no more than $200k for a top-tier candidate for DevRel - IMO we don’t need to be hiring a celebrity who asks for much higher than this.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fully support the work this team is doing, would love for these concerns to be addressed before I’m willing to fully support this budget request.</p>

            <p>For sure, that’s a good question. We spoke with GPC and they suggested it made sense for us to take on the initial budget for this while the strategy gets set up, while they’ll take on the costs once the team is ramped up (we are co-managing hiring).</p>
<p>The costs here include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consulting costs with key ecosystem players (names you would recognize, approximately $30-40k)</li>
<li>Quarterly cost for a lead level hire (on market this can range from $250-400k per year so up to $100k / quarter depending on experience)</li>
<li>Quarterly cost for an ‘integrations support engineer’ that can work directly with partnerships to help ensure those onboarding to the protocol have everything they need from a technical standpoint to get their instance started (likely around $150-180k total per year, so ~$45k in total)</li>
</ul>
<p>The exact range of these will vary so we opted not to include an exact breakdown but in hindsight it probably would have been useful. Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>Thanks for sharing! This budget request was mostly clear and straightforward for me but I wanted to understand a bit more about the developer relations budget since it’s higher than I would have expected. How many new hires are you planning on making with the $176k for one season?</p>
