The proposal for this transition will be posted to the governance forum for further discussion.

The meeting included discussions on strategic pivots for Allo, moving towards a category-first approach that encompasses launching a VC fund and developing non-protocol-oriented software. Ed Fleming stressed the need for collaboration to explore synergies between Allo's focus on developers and builders. Kevin Owocki expressed confidence in aligning incentives across various layers and highlighted the shift away from protocol constraints, allowing for more customer-centric product development.

Mathilda DV.eth introduced a new multi-mechanism funding strategy that will implement three funding rounds each year, focusing on decentralization and various funding methods. The strategy includes quadratic funding for early-stage projects and metrics-based retrofunding for mature initiatives.
