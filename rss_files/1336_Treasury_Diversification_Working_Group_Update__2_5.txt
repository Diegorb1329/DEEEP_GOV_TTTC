    **Treasury Diversification Working Group Update - 2/5/2022**

Hi all, sharing an update from the working group.

**Update from Last Week**

- Drafted our latest forum post welcoming strategic partners to participate in the treasury diversification.
- Incorporated feedback from our first treasury diversification forum post.
- Made a list of specific value-adds that partners should provide to Gitcoin, incorporating Gitcoin's main strategic goals.
- Shared [Treasury Diversification Part II - Welcoming Strategic Partners](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/treasury-diversification-part-ii-welcoming-strategic-partners/9825) on the forum.
- Made a form for potential strategic partners (linked in the forum post).
- Started tracking working group hours.


**Plan for This Week**
This week, our focus will be on taking in interest from strategic partners.
- Draft a detailed plan for how we'll reach out to and speak with candidate partners (how & where we'll speak with them, how/where/when we'll have them speak to the community, etc.).
- Reach out to potential candidates and have them fill out our interest form.
- Respond to community feedback here and on our second forum post. Integrate that feedback in our process where relevant.
- Share any conflicts of interest (as defined in our Ethics Policy in [forum post 2](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/treasury-diversification-part-ii-welcoming-strategic-partners/9825)).

**Asks from the Community**
We encourage community members to share their feedback on the second forum post and suggest any other criteria they feel is relevant.
