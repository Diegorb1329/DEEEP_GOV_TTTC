https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/dao-financial-report-june-2024/19225
    **Summary**

Over the past month, our operational expenses totaled $807,204, showing a notable increase of $173,446 compared to the previous month. This rise of 27.37% underscores a temporary deviation from our commitment to stability. However, these costs are aligned with our strategic focus on product development and readiness for shipment.

This report offers a comprehensive analysis of our financial performance in June 2024, emphasizing key metrics and budgetary insights.

## [Overview](https://dune.com/umarkhaneth/gitcoin-treasury)

* **Last Month's Treasury Holdings**: $67,109,851
* **Current Month Treasury Holdings**: $31,765,250
* **Variance** (-$35,344,601, 52.67%): This change was primarily driven by fluctuations in token prices, which experienced a downturn last month. Additionally, our monthly operating expenses across all workstreams amounted to $807,204, further contributing to this variance..

## Runway

The recent decline in the value of our treasury's GTC holdings, primarily influenced by GTC's performance, has impacted our Runway projection. Currently, our Runway is estimated to be 45 months (4 years), factoring in an anticipated expenditure of $700,000 across our Business Units and the Ecosystem Collective.

Our DAO currently holds a total of $22,885,275.00 worth of GTC tokens, with each token averaging a value of $0.71.

Our reliance on GTC now stands at 72.05% of our treasury, highlighting the significant impact of this token's performance. To mitigate risks associated with market fluctuations and ensure financial resilience, it is crucial to diligently monitor and explore strategies for diversifying our treasury holdings.

**Last Month's Expenditure**: Totaled $807,204, representing a significant 27.37% increase (equivalent to $173,446) compared to the previous month's expenditure of $633,758. This overspend highlights challenges in resource allocation management. Moving forward, it's essential to reassess our budgeting strategies to ensure more prudent spending and sustainable financial health.
