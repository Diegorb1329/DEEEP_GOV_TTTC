    # Gitcoin Governance Report

## June 2023

Find attached the Gitcoin Governance Report. This report chronicles governance activity for the month of June 2023 and looks forward to the month of July. As always, we welcome any feedback to make this report better. The objective of this communication is to:

1. Improve governance transparency.
2. Provide a go-to platform for proposal and comment summaries.
3. Highlight a couple governance initiatives during the period
4. Illustrate GCP and non GCP efforts being worked on or evaluated.

June has been focused on preparing for the Steward Council elections as per [[GCP-007] S18 Fund Thin Governance](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gcp-007-s18-fund-thin-governance/14149). According to the time tracker, time spent was on track. To bring time spent into the allocated range, meeting attendance was reduced however I did begin joining the weekly MMM calls.

### Governance proposals and performance during the period:

![|720x207](upload://5F4fwXt1iIRNhDYyeoipKXIxAix.png)

This chart can be an illustration of 1) governance engagement during the period and 2) individual proposal performance. Over time, we will be able to illustrate if governance changes influence token voting and in later versions, individual voter influence. Gitcoin has 8 stewards who hold between 800K to 1.3M tokens ‚Äì which can influence the variability in tokens cast during any single vote. Applied to the chart above, it takes the four largest voters to vote in unison to surpass the high water majority vote of ~5M votes.

### Governance activity during the period:

**Steward Council Elections:**

In an effort to work through the +60 potential nominees, Governance increased support by working through the list of viable candidates to help workstreams narrow in on 12 nominees. As of July 07, here is the current status:
![|720x448.7862922417898](upload://d5Ba55o0XpoO0lchPgeTPmaUAPN.png)

The goal is to have 12 nominees who will run in a token weighted quadratic election for 8 external seats on the 13 member Steward Council. Recall four seats of the 13 seats are held by workstream appointees, and one is held by the Gitcoin Foundation. We plan to share the final list of nominees on July 11 or 12th via a post on the forum and continue the process via this schedule:

![|720x209](upload://oDwQ4Q3rYhKpS5h4ERyNwlG8mds.png)

See our elections plan [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Kb-0WpDsqxuFxhA9QB7oPi3jw5xQSvcT8JROdiKTIA/edit?usp=sharing) and view the potential nominee slide deck [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZZB7J6VrqIT6vZb5GWQiTsglMScQhOd38_m30jYu4Zw/edit?usp=sharing).

**Spam attack on snapshot account:**

Recall earlier this year there were several spam proposals posted to our snapshot account which prompted the lockdown of proposal creation and the creation of [Gating who can make Gitcoin proposals on Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0xa18926b9dc9592bdf02acc3cef5a41021cebe51f73a2a3d6b007d7c38685b296). At the end of June, we had +30 spam proposals posted to our snapshot account even with the new Passport gating in place. Thanks to @coachJ, we were able to quickly remove the proposals and lock down proposal creation to these five addresses: ![|538x199](upload://xyfoj5d5zhzXBek3oiMmZxDZZnp.png)

We continue to work on defining either the right stamp configuration, or with the help of the Snapshot team, implement the passport scoring methodology. In the meantime, either @shawn16400 or @kbh can help you get a proposal loaded, or add you as an author to the site until we get Passport gating sorted.

**Other assets worked in the period:** [CSDO Charter v2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rV-EQEY4YZUl5DR-IW-AE50U0m0FksrishFRcDEI0Go/edit?usp=sharing), [PGN: the Gitcoin Foundation and the DAO](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ItIbaF_XBCzBXO6WHLRfS1QqGs6ksQJ2iA1jo4mWaoY/edit?usp=sharing), the [(IPA) Independent proposal assessment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1odxKemzTz__llcZLuIWj2s_gefmaL0qMCYkt9ePckXc/edit?usp=sharing) and refinements with AI generated summaries of forum [proposals & discussions](https://gitcoin.justbonfire.com/governance).

### Looking forward ‚Äì governance work coming up in July

We have two ‚Äúbig rocks‚Äù in July and will continue to address other smaller items. Work that is coming off the plate is improving the monthly reports, exploring shielded voting, and advocating for quadratic voting at Gitcoin.

Big Rocks for July

* Steward Council Nominations & Elections & snapshot configuration
* Recommendations for Governance moving beyond S18

Smaller Rocks for July

* Steward & steward council recognition
* Snapshot voting clean up (QV subsite)
* Snapshot and Passport - getting stamps right
* Gating the forum using Passport
* Using Push protocol for governance communications
* Keep or kill AI efforts related to forum summaries

The entire list of governance project work along with daily movement can be seen [here](https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/7e87f59bd8b5406abf2fe27c2644389d?v=516683c86577466990b706aed22ff80a&pvs=4). This includes GCP-007 work and extracurricular deliverables.

Thanks for reading this month‚Äôs summary ‚Äì we appreciate any and all feedback.

<p><strong>Steward Council Elections:</strong><br>
We continue to narrow down the list of potential nominees across workstreams and although we have a lot of strong candidates, we do not yet have a final list of nominees. Here is a visual on progress by workstream:</p>

<p>.<br>
MMM &amp; PGF are very close to locking down nominees and and Passport is close as well.  Allo / Grants stack have plenty of good candidates, but need to continue working to lock up nominees.</p>
<p>Based on this - a general consensus from workstream contacts is to push back the elections one week to make sure we have time to lock in the right web 3 leaders.  The new schedule looks like this:</p>

<p><strong>Steward Council Elections:</strong><br>
Over the next two weeks we are working through nominations for the Gitcoin Steward Council.  To date, we have easily three times as many potential nominees this round vs. the prior round and this is a great signal in relation to the diversity of candidates on the draft list of candidates.   The downside is informing and confirming with each of all these candidates is consuming a lot of time and most of the other governance efforts will likely be on hold until the list is locked down.  Regardless, this is a happy problem as we are expecting great things for our next cohort.</p>
<p>Here is the baseline plan and will post here if it changes.<br>

<p><strong>Last week</strong><br>
<em>Voting:</em></p>
<p>Last week we saw the passage of proposed Amendments to the <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0x3197b27c0f667ced874f3fa0ad9e5bdd00e7bd4222a4c19a6692c7e3e9b0c42e">Steward Council</a>.  This proposal makes some adjustments to the Steward Council for efficacy and continues to leverage Quadratic Voting for council selection, but this time we will use token weighted voting vs. an egalitarian vote.</p>
<p>There were no votes passed on Tally last week.</p>

Based on last weeks passage of the proposed changes to the Steward Council, the schedule for the elections has been proposed and reviews with current CDSO members are underway to confirm. If there are no major objections, the schedule below should be about right.</p>

<li>Provide a go-to platform for proposal and comment summaries.</li>
<li>Highlight a couple governance initiatives during the period</li>
<li>Illustrate GCP and non GCP efforts being worked on or evaluated.</li>
</ol>
<p>June has been focused on preparing for the Steward Council elections as per <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gcp-007-s18-fund-thin-governance/14149">[GCP-007] S18 Fund Thin Governance</a>. According to the time tracker, time spent was on track. To bring time spent into the allocated range, meeting attendance was reduced however I did begin joining the weekly MMM calls.</p>

<p>This chart can be an illustration of 1) governance engagement during the period and 2) individual proposal performance. Over time, we will be able to illustrate if governance changes influence token voting and in later versions, individual voter influence. Gitcoin has 8 stewards who hold between 800K to 1.3M tokens ‚Äì which can influence the variability in tokens cast during any single vote. Applied to the chart above, it takes the four largest voters to vote in unison to surpass the high water majority vote of ~5M votes.</p>

<p><strong>Steward Council Elections:</strong></p>
<p>In an effort to work through the +60 potential nominees, Governance increased support by working through the list of viable candidates to help workstreams narrow in on 12 nominees. As of July 07, here is the current status:<br>

<p>The goal is to have 12 nominees who will run in a token weighted quadratic election for 8 external seats on the 13 member Steward Council. Recall four seats of the 13 seats are held by workstream appointees, and one is held by the Gitcoin Foundation. We plan to share the final list of nominees on July 11 or 12th via a post on the forum and continue the process via this schedule:</p>

<p><strong>Spam attack on snapshot account:</strong></p>
<p>Recall earlier this year there were several spam proposals posted to our snapshot account which prompted the lockdown of proposal creation and the creation of <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0xa18926b9dc9592bdf02acc3cef5a41021cebe51f73a2a3d6b007d7c38685b296">Gating who can make Gitcoin proposals on Snapshot</a>. At the end of June, we had +30 spam proposals posted to our snapshot account even with the new Passport gating in place. Thanks to <span class="mention">@coachJ</span>, we were able to quickly remove the proposals and lock down proposal creation to these five addresses: <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/e/eb26d3b78ec594a04d230360845855b060079147.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="xyfoj5d5zhzXBek3oiMmZxDZZnp" width="538" height="199" role="presentation"></p>
<p>We continue to work on defining either the right stamp configuration, or with the help of the Snapshot team, implement the passport scoring methodology. In the meantime, either <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/shawn16400">@shawn16400</a> or <span class="mention">@kbh</span> can help you get a proposal loaded, or add you as an author to the site until we get Passport gating sorted.</p>
