* [Why I am a Holon maximalist](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/why-i-am-holon-maximalist/10152) by [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki) introduces Holons as ‚ÄúGreek for ‚Äúwhole/parts‚Äù meaning literally the whole that is simultaneously a part, and vice versa. Holons are the circles that we live in.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat I think is cool about a holonic point of view of Gitcoin Grants is that each of the grants in Gitcoin has a lot to gain from the multiple holons (grants rounds) it is in.‚Äù
