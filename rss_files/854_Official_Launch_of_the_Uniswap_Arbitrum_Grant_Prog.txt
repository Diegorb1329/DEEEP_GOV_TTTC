# Introduction

The Uniswap-Arbitrum Grant Program (UAGP) is a **6-month grant program fueling projects of two leading ecosystems.** Its objective is to foster growth and advance projects that build exclusively within the Uniswap-Arbitrum ecosystem, focusing on long-term benefits.

As we gear up for a **launch on November 8th**, we want to give the community a view of whatâ€™s on the horizon.

# What is the UAGP?

The Uniswap-Arbitrum Grant Program (UAGP) is a **6-month initiative providing grants from $50,000 to $250,000 in ARB tokens** to developers building within the Uniswap-Arbitrum ecosystem. With over 1m $ARB tokens in the program, the goal is to accelerate adoption and highlight the expansive opportunities that emerge in overlapping areas of the two ecosystems.

Arbitrum is among the best-known scaling solutions for Ethereum, offering rapid, cost-effective transactions while preserving Ethereumâ€™s security. The deployment of Uniswap on Arbitrum marked a significant stride towards scaling. Now, **UAGP aims to advance this mission by financing protocols that improve the liquidity, usability, and composability of Uniswap on Arbitrum.**

# Mission of the UAGP

The UNI/ARB Grant Program (UAGP) aims to:

* **Fund High-Impact Projects:** The program allocates grants specifically to projects that demonstrate the potential for substantial positive impact on the Uniswap and Arbitrum ecosystems with grants from 50,000 to 250,000 $ARB.
* **Strengthen the Uniswap and Arbitrum Ecosystems:** The UNI/ARB Grant Program (UAGP) aims to strengthen the ties and facilitate exchange between the Uniswap and Arbitrum ecosystems.
* **Ensure Transparency and Community Input:** The program mandates regular progress reports and seeks community feedback to influence the direction of funded projects.
