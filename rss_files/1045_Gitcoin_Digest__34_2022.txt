  * We posted [this thread](https://twitter.com/gitcoin/status/1572616687949840384?s=20&t=a5jfVWtzfeL4Gi8ICADt0A) on Tornado Cash, and what this recent Office of Foreign Assets Control ruling means for crypto.

  * Schelling Point Bogotá is [happening on October 10th](https://twitter.com/schellingpoint_/status/1562778524402204672?s=20&t=NUoiTQyvE4nZyG0ZzoNrXQ)–less than a month away! The site is now up.

  * We have been running one grants round per quarter for nearly four years! No small feat. Owocki [posted this short thread](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1572072713015136256?s=20&t=vi200mPe_57AIixc9IkBCQ) musing on how far we’ve come in the 3.75 years that Gitcoin has been running grants rounds 🫶 🌱

### 📯 From the Governance Forum

  * [**“Project Management at GitcoinDAO”–Puncar**
](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/project-management-at-gitcoindao/11523)
Puncar, Tigress, and June co-authored this proposal to standardize project management at Gitcoin. In the proposal, they diagnose current bottlenecks in the DAO’s project management process, and offer recommendations for an improved project and task workflow. 
Special focus is given to aligning on naming conventions and “using [the] same statuses when dealing with projects and tasks. This proposal is open for comments and suggestions for the next week. In about two weeks, a final version of the proposal will be presented to CSDO. If the proposal is ratified, this team proposes to spend October working with workstreams to help implement these new standards. 

    **Request for Comment:** [Read the proposal and offer comments + feedback here.

  * [**“The limits of Sybil defense (and how composability might help)”–J. Cook**
](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-limits-of-sybil-defense-and-how-composability-might-help/11524)
J. Cook wrote this deep dive about how we might think about the limits of sybil defense. For instance, it’s impossible to design a system to protect against every possible sybil attack – but is that even necessary? He offers thinking in regard to how composability may provide new solutions for sybil defense, and how Grants 2.0 is working to implement them.

### 🗞️ From the Gitcoin Blog This Week:

  * [**“From Grantee to Funder: 1inch”, by Scott Milat**
](https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/from-grantee-to-funder-1inch)
In this case study, we look back on how 1inch grew from a humble hackathon project and Gitcoin grantee, to a giant in DeFi that came back to give to Gitcoin!

  * [**“Closing the gender gap in web3”, by MathildaDV**
](https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/closing-the-gender-gap-in-web3)
This piece defines the problem of the gender gap in web3 and showcases three women-led web3 projects that create space for diversity to flourish, and are working towards shifting web3 to being a more equitable and inclusive realm for all.

  * [**“The Merge + GR15 Mitigation and Offset Partners: This is Simply the Beginning”, by Team Gitcoin**
](https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/the-merge-gr15)
This post showcases the numerous carbon offset projects we are running with our GR15 Mitigation and Offset Partners. For this initiative, we’ve joined with Toucan, KlimaDAO, Nori, Regen Network, Helios and Zero Labs to offset and mitigate the carbon emissions from the last couple years of Gitcoin’s grants rounds and more than halfway to the total emissions to date.

    Read the post to learn more, and then join the movement to offset Ethereum’s historical carbon footprint by [joining the Merge4Climate Discord](https://discord.gg/WX5t2KzX8C) and adding your name to the [Sign on Statement](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfL3t7lzdQLr3z-WDV7S-FaDmHBTyKbP2B5Pfdxzra3Hw0bGw/viewform) congratulating the decentralized team of over 100 developers who have contributed to making “the merge” a reality.

    *Thanks to Ben and Coleen who wrote this post.*

  * [**"Gitcoin: the Ecosystem Innovation Flywheel", by Team Gitcoin**
](https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-the-ecosystem-innovation-flywheel)
This post explores the composability of web3 ecosystems, Ethereum’s role as a provider of web3 “money legos”, and Gitcoin’s role as an Ecosystem Innovation Flywheel! The post delves into how Quadratic Funding enables developers to build the public goods of tomorrow, and how this enables a “virtuous cycle”, where we are all participating in creating an internet built by all of us, for all of us.

    *Thank you to Faith, Armando, and MathildaDV for co-creating this piece.*

</a><br>
This post showcases the numerous carbon offset projects we are running with our GR15 Mitigation and Offset Partners. For this initiative, we’ve joined with Toucan, KlimaDAO, Nori, Regen Network, Helios and Zero Labs to offset and mitigate the carbon emissions from the last couple years of Gitcoin’s grants rounds and more than halfway to the total emissions to date.</p>
<p>Read the post to learn more, and then join the movement to offset Ethereum’s historical carbon footprint by <a href="https://discord.gg/WX5t2KzX8C" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">joining the Merge4Climate Discord</a> and adding your name to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfL3t7lzdQLr3z-WDV7S-FaDmHBTyKbP2B5Pfdxzra3Hw0bGw/viewform" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Sign on Statement</a> congratulating the decentralized team of over 100 developers who have contributed to making “the merge” a reality.</p>

</a><br>
This post explores the composability of web3 ecosystems, Ethereum’s role as a provider of web3 “money legos”, and Gitcoin’s role as an Ecosystem Innovation Flywheel! The post delves into how Quadratic Funding enables developers to build the public goods of tomorrow, and how this enables a “virtuous cycle”, where we are all participating in creating an internet built by all of us, for all of us.</p>
