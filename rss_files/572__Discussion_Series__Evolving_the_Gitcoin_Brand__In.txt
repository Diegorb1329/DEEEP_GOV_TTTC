https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-series-evolving-the-gitcoin-brand-introduction-overview/12164
    # TLDR

What?

* As Gitcoin continues to evolve, we’re taking the opportunity to examine our brand (across different expressions (from visual to verbal to experiential).
* This post aims to explore what brand means and why it matters, and then examines how we can actively evolve ours to meet the needs determined by this next phase of our evolution, the launch of new protocols.
* It then summarizes the work we’ve done thus far to evolve our brand strategy in order to inform future design and marketing decisions.

Why?

* The hope is that this is the first of many posts on this forum for us to explore brand in public together as we embrace our status as a headless brand.

Anything else?

* Most of the items linked here can be found on the [MMM Brand Hub](https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/Brand-Design-36a0641a66da4b1d9e0167139a1f37ac?p=1b4e6551fbc54c47a4fccc0db1b37809&pm=s).
* In addition to discussion and feedback here, we welcome additional discussion feedback on the #mmm-brand channel in Discord as well as the Brand Pod channel which will launch shortly.

# Gitcoin is evolving, and so should our Brand

Gitcoin was founded with the purpose to further the development and funding of open source software.

Over the years, how we fulfilled that purpose changed - from bounties to hackathons to Gitcoin Grants. So has how we describe our purpose, switching between words like open source, public goods, and most recently, shared needs. In the same vein, as our vernacular has evolved, so has our look and feel. Illustrations have shifted from robots to astronauts, colors have shifted from dark to light to dark again. We’ve also had open forum discussions call attention to our evolving language and visual identity.

Today, we’re at a critical point in our evolution, perhaps as critical as when we unlocked the potential of Quadratic Funding, the mechanism that has to date made our Grants Program so successful. We’ve taken years of learnings and turned insights into action, creating a range of pluralistic tools that can be leveraged at scale, opening unprecedented opportunities for local communities and their supporters to build for global impact.

And with this change - this next phase of our evolution - comes the need to re-look at ourselves, and in particular, our brand - which is much more than our logo and illustration style, it’s the emotional connection that comes from the total sum of expressions by which we’re recognized. Inevitably, as we evolve, so do these expressions. But how?

# First, what’s brand and why does it matter?

The topic of brand – and more specifically, brand strategy – is one that cannot be simplified, especially at a “decentralized brand,” or, as others sometimes refer to it, a “headless brand.”

This section will address:

* What is Brand
* What is a Decentralized Brand
* What is Brand Strategy
* What is a Decentralized Brand Strategy
* Why does Brand Strategy matter

The terms brand and brand strategy are frequently used interchangeably. There isn’t always a shared, clear understanding of what they actually mean, or how they’re different from each other. This lack of clarity can sometimes result in misunderstanding – and a communication breakdown around a critical part of any organization or business.

So first goal: define Brand.

For many modern companies, their brand is their single most valuable asset. Nike. Patagonia. Coca Cola. This is also becoming true for many recognizable brands in the web3 space - Uniswap, Aave, Lens, Zora, FWB.

What first comes to mind when you think brand? Probably logo. Maybe color. Maybe typography. But it’s also likely something else; something intangible yet incredibly powerful at the same time. It’s a feeling. It’s the gut reaction that happens when someone thinks of the brand.

It's not just the logo, the font, the color palette. It’s more than the visual identity (all of those things – logo, font, palette - plus other visual elements like iconography.)

It’s more than the verbal identity (the vernacular or words you use, voice, and tone.)

Brand is the emotional connection that our audience, community and customers have with our organization. It is shaped by our name, logo, overall visual and verbal identity, marketing and advertising, and—most importantly—the experiences customers associate with us. It’s the sum of all expressions by which an entity (person, organization, company, business unit, city, nation, etc.) intends to be recognized.

This means:

* How people identify us
* How we express ourselves
* How we create a shared understanding, appreciation or association
* …through visual cues like logo, color palette and typography
* …through written cues like ownable vernacular
* …through memes
* …through serial content like blogs, podcasts
* …through events and experiences online and off

A few things brand has the power to do:

* Garner loyalty
* Inspire word-of-mouth marketing
* Set you apart from other competitors in the marketplace
* Allow you to command premium pricing for your products or services

Brand is not in our direct control – it’s in the minds of our community. This is true for all brands, not just decentralized ones. A decentralized brand, as defined by [Other Internet](https://otherinter.net/research/headless-brands/), belongs to no one, and can be remixed by anyone. It’s a meme. It can only be "designed" in a very limited sense. It has its own autonomy, generated by the contributions of individual actors, a million person chorus acting as one.

That said, there are ways we can take action to shape our brand indirectly in order to strengthen it and shift perception.

How do we decide on those actions? How do we even know what kind of brand we want to have? How do we decide how we want to be perceived? How do we help shape the way our community perceives us as a whole? This is where brand strategy comes into play.

Brand strategy is the ‘big picture’ plans and tactics deployed by an organization to create long-term brand equity and competitive advantages from branding.

Aka, it’s:

* a plan to actively influence how people perceive our brand
* clarifies where we’re headed
* defines what we’re are trying to achieve
* provides a map and compass, setting a True North so to speak, to help us get there
* helps us figure out what to do, and perhaps even more importantly, what not to do

It’s not (important clarification here!)

* a business strategy, which is also being worked on simultaneously.

According to Other Internet, “headless brand strategy is an ecosystemic affair and entails the mobilization of a decentralized set of actors. At its core, it revolves around giving agency to different stakeholders in a way that lets them coordinate more effectively and feel connected to the brand. What projects can do, in this context, is provide the resources, tools, and wayfinding devices for different stakeholders to converge around a single narrative.”

We love a good iceberg meme - here’s one for Brand:

**![|700x460](upload://6XPQqBVNQx5R2zGsFBNhRXQBD00.png)**

Why is Brand Strategy important?

1. To help us articulate and communicate our core values: People usually buy into why you do what you do before they buy into what you do. To attract and retain loyal contributors we must understand and communicate what we stand for.
2. To help us identify weaknesses in our brand experience: If the experiences our audiences have interacting with us aren’t consistent, we’ll struggle to build trust and customer loyalty.
3. To filter out ill-advised ideas that would damage your brand-building efforts: It’s easy to succumb to shiny-object syndrome. A clear brand strategy makes it easier to make prudent decisions.
4. To create accountability: Committing to a clear brand strategy helps keep everyone in the organization accountable, focused on high-yield initiatives that will actually move the needle. It helps us stay on track.
5. To focus our marketing efforts: By narrowing and clarifying the scope of your marketing efforts, we can ensure smoother and more effective execution of marketing campaigns. We know who we’re targeting, we know what they care about, and we know how to speak to them.
6. To help designers and creatives do better, more effective work. Without a strategy to underpin creative decisions, they are inherently subjective and arbitrary.
7. To align and engage the team in the vision: A major part of the brand strategy process is getting our team to buy into the vision and values of our brand.

Components of an effective brand strategy

1. Values: These are the beliefs that inform everything we do.
2. Vision: The message that speaks to our target audience, telling them what we’re here to do and why we’re here to do it. It tells them what to expect when they interact with our brand.
3. Mission: A brand mission is how we work towards our vision – or the “how we do it” complement to the “what are we here to do”.
4. Positioning statement: A positioning statement encompasses all of the above and effectively communicates value proposition to your ideal customer or target audience(s).
5. Audience: This is who we’re here for - and our target audience should be laser focused.
6. Voice and tone (as well as specific messaging/vernacular): A framework around how we communicate.
7. Look and feel of our brand identity: A good strategy can guide the creative expressions of our brand identity to make sure they are aligned with our positioning goals and the tastes of our main audiences.
8. BONUS!: Prioritized brand touchpoints and awareness-drivers: Brand touchpoints are any points of contact between our business and our audience/users. They can include website, email newsletter, social media accounts, events, and merch—to just name a few.

Ultimately, a good brand strategy will help you focus on the most important, high-yield touchpoints to avoid spreading your organization too thin.

When not building a brand from the ground up, there are two ways we can talk about updating Brand Identity. They are brand refresh and rebrand.

A brand refresh is when a brand attempts to modernize its image while maintaining its core identity and strategy. A rebrand is a complete overhaul of the brand's identity and strategy, typically enacted when the current brand strategy fails.

At Gitcoin, we haven’t had a clearly defined brand strategy informing design in the past, thus it is challenging to objectively say whether or not we’ve succeeded or failed. However, given the success of our Grants Programs, which can be considered our “MVP,” the subsequent initiatives that have succeeded and ultimately “spun out” of Gitcoin, and the brand affinity and equity we’ve established among our core audiences, it is appropriate to say we enter this next phase of our evolution with a range of achievements, and therefore owe attention to past visual and verbal expressions.

# What’s been going on with the brand evolution work so far?

Brand Strategies begin with insights and research, which is what we’ve been doing since this initiative kicked off a few months ago. We began the brand evolution work with a [DAO-wide brand attributes workshop](https://www.figma.com/file/uR6hsqSqXS4JUfm17zdNTV/Gitcoin-Brand-Attributes-Workshop?node-id=108%3A386&t=bO2x6z4XTnpNIyaB-1) during a DAO-vibes takeover. Since then, we’ve conducted numerous discovery interviews, competitive/landscape research and working sessions in order to put pen to paper on a brand strategy that can inform the intentional evolution of those brand expressions - from typography and color palette to tone and merch. And that’s what we’re excited to begin sharing in the hope to kickoff a robust discussion around brand, and answer any questions you might have about this work.

Below summarizes our work to date, including:

1. Brand Attributes Workshop
2. Discovery Interviews
3. Brand Strategy Audit
4. Brand Visual Audit
5. Brand Working Group Work
6. Market/Competitive Insights

All of this is the foundation upon which we’re building a brand strategy. We hope that by sharing this here we can gather any questions and comments that arise and in turn answer them through future discussion forums.

## II. Brand Attributes Workshop

To kick off the brand evolution work, we hosted a Brand Attributes workshop where we asked the community key questions from which themes started to emerge. These informed the themes we explored further in subsequent working group sessions as well as in key interviews. See FigJam [here](https://www.figma.com/file/uR6hsqSqXS4JUfm17zdNTV/Gitcoin-Brand-Attributes-Workshop?node-id=108%3A386&t=bO2x6z4XTnpNIyaB-1).

The TLDR:

* Questions we asked:
  * What makes us different?
  * How would others describe us?
  * How do we sound to others?
  * What impact will we have?
  * How do people feel interacting with us?
* Themes that emerged:
* We are unbound by existing systems
* We are hopeful for a better future
* We empower people to make positive change
* We enable regenerative initiatives
* We celebrate the many, not the few
* We believe in the power of collaboration over competition
* We educate around the value of public goods
* We welcome people with open arms
* We are leaders not followers
* We create foundational infrastructure - things to be built on top of
* We help foster more equitable, whole lives
* We invest in our community and their communities

## III. Discovery Interviews

Next, we interviewed key thought leaders across the organization, asking them a series of questions that would help us distill key insights (specifically areas of alignment and misalignment), uncover key strategic opportunities, understand history and flag challenges. Find full Discovery Findings [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VbiNYPypi1fd4dtBqKPJ5NZ9qkQdhmwZaCaru0AWACg/edit?usp=sharing).

The TLDR:

* Where We Are: We’re in the in between - a state of flux - but we know there’s greatness in our future.
* What We Do & Why We Do It: We’re mission aligned and inspired - we empower communities to fund their shared needs. This expansive purpose shapes our product vision.
* What & Who We’re Here For: We are for the greater good. We’re human centric and community first - and we build in service of their needs.
* What’s Next: Our current brand identity isn’t always serving us - and there are opportunities for us to optimize to make the community feel more connected to our vision. A lot of what’s been done in the past was “yolo’ed,” and we’re ready to be more intentional with our visual and verbal expressions.

## III. Brand Strategy Audit

Simultaneously, we reviewed publicly available expressions of Brand Strategy (Mission, Vision, etc.). As part of our work, we reviewed and referenced our community’s past work - including but not limited to:

* [the Other Internet work ](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Yo4vzvtw_gvgUQoS6VQXa057ukFu_9hhC14klFBfjcU/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Mission and Vision work](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-community-input-on-gitcoindao-s-draft-purpose-essential-intents/10662/13)
* [Feedback on Mission and Vision work](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fhoiFyHb7B_ICttLOKuHcdgRUpUEBgMKrYAG8w97g_o/edit?usp=sharing)

Find entire Brand Audit [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VEXYo09gdMrosBCWY_gLfB11V87y-U6L5-95c3WzVOI/edit?usp=sharing).

The TLDR:

* Challenge 1: Lack of Cohesive Narrative Across Past, Present & Future: There was no single source for our brand narrative - the where we’ve been, where we are, where we’re going, which made it challenging identify intentional
* Challenge 2: Mission Cohesion: expressed in different ways in various places across owned and partner channels
* Challenge 3: No Defined Community Aligned Values: our values were never clearly codified for our community - and while they were several iterations of them, none felt wholly embraced
* Challenge 4: No Defined Personality Traits: while our brand has a personality, it often feels like an afterthought, and was never specifically defined in a set of traits acknowledged as ours
* Challenge 5: Inconsistent Messaging: Overall inconsistencies; Style, tone and comms hierarchy are unclear; often lacking call to action and reliant on descriptive, prescriptive language rather than inspiring or insightful

##

## IV. Brand Visual Audit

Next, we reviewed publicly available expressions of Brand Identity (Logo, Illustration/Graphics, Web Design, etc.) to showcase where our Strategy and Identity are working in or out of alignment in order to make strategic recommendations for future design considerations.).

As part of our work, we reviewed and referenced specific visual expressions across touchpoints including but not limited to:

* http://decentralized.quadraticlands.com/
* https://schellingpoint.gitcoin.co/
* https://passport.gitcoin.co/
* https://gitcoin.co/

Find entire Brand Audit [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VEXYo09gdMrosBCWY_gLfB11V87y-U6L5-95c3WzVOI/edit?usp=sharing).

The TLDR:

* Challenge 1: Logo Cohesion: There are inconsistencies in how our logo and lockups are used
* Challenge 2: The Astronaut (or Robo) as a Symbol: While we use this as a symbol, some of the symbolic elements are misaligned with what we do
* Challenge 3: Iconography & Illustration: Iconography style inconsistencies which can create confusion and mistrust
* Challenge 4: Website Visual Impact: Across certain touchpoints, we’ve intentionally created moments for users to feel connected and engaged with the overall experience - but interactive elements are inconsistent and lack relevance to our messages/intentions
* Challenge 5: Inconsistencies Across Product & Protocol: “Vibe” inconsistencies across product and protocols

## V. Brand Working Group

We created a smaller working group (a precursor to what we’re now calling Pods - comprised of cross-workstream contributors) to begin ideating around Brand Strategy that builds upon our existing Brand Purpose, creating a cohesive Brand Narrative - giving us more clarity around key strategic elements and considerations that can inform the evolution of our visual identity.

To better understand our process, visit our [Brand Evolution Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPWmsSIM=/)

The TLDR:

* Our aim was to begin to define how we would align the DAO around a set of common values and objectives so we can collectively do a better job in allocating resources, setting priorities, executing, and evolving towards a shared “North Star.”
* Here, we looked closely at the role of audience within the strategy, reviewing past surveys to understand audience needs and where their current affinities lie
* We examined our product pipeline and positioning to better understand where we fit in the market today and where we’re going
* We took into consideration our own organization - the DAO - and what that means in relation to brand strategy
* We began to define our mission, vision and values, the foundation of the brand strategy
* Last, we shared this work with a bigger working group for feedback, as well as with Design contributors in order to begin looking at design considerations - and that’s where we are today!

## VI. Market/Competitive Insights

While we strive for originality, we must also take into consideration market trends and forces as well as what our “competitors” are saying and doing. This helps us ensure we’ve got an edge but are also remaining top of the game. [Here’s](https://app.pitch.com/app/public/player/9749f0af-186a-4774-becb-0ff13c28a05c) a summary of our findings.

# What’s next? Honing our brand strategy

With this foundational work completed, we’re looking to define our Brand Strategy. The Brand Strategy is not meant to be overly prescriptive. Rather, it aims to offer a framework as well as a set of tools that should give contributors and the community a clear sense of direction. It also helps to inform design development and decisions.

This diagram sums up our process and where we are (definition):![|663x227](upload://bvYdZyoU0ZeqjaL24dPIQlUqkep.png)

We’ll be sharing the Brand Strategy for commentary soon, and appreciate any and all feedback.

Once we’ve aligned on the Brand Strategy, we will use it as a lens through which to continuously evaluate and refine design.

From a design perspective, our goals will be to:

* Strengthen the connection to Gitcoin across everything we do
* Capitalize on our strongest brand equities
* Modernize the look and feel of the brand
* Drive consistency and reduce complexity

Whether or not we move forward with a brand refresh, rebrand, or something in between is up to us - the main goal is to ensure there is intentionality behind our design elements, and that we feel confident our brand expressions uphold our strategy.

Lastly, it’s important to note that our brand is a living and breathing thing, and none of this work is meant to be overly prescriptive - instead, it should feel organically aligned with shifts happening in other areas of the organization as they relate to the ways in which we activate against our mission and vision. Simultaneously, it should also act as a membrane, not as a hard shell. We want to build a brand that feels inviting and inclusive enough for contributors to take it and turn it into something outside our wildest dreams in order to inspire greater affinity and connection across our audiences.

# Share your feedback!

We welcome all feedback and questions at this stage and invite you to discuss this further during our Gitcoin Community Call (FKA DAO Vibes) takeover on 12/7.

            <p>I like your analogy here with the lop-sided person - makes for a funny picture haha. Coincidentally, we underwent much of this brand work to meaningfully update the website and streamline a visitor UX so that information is much clearer and easier to find.</p>
<p>MMM &amp; DAO Ops is working on a community hub (which will be linked from the website) that will act as a single source of truth for anyone looking for more info as it relates to DAO strategy, events, stewardship, etc. Would you be interested in giving us feedback on this once the draft is ready to share?</p>
<p>I agree that information symmetry and making that info readily available to “outsiders”/interested stakeholders is super important.</p>

            <p>I agree that this post is a nice vantage point into Gitcoin’s evolution.  I’d love to see more rigarous thought and planning like this in public.</p>
<p>Gitcoin’s evolution into a DAO is so strange because it’s so uneven.  It’s like it grew the right leg of a marathon runner and the left leg of a couch potato.    The right arm of a weight lifter and the left arm of a couch potato.  And a core that can’t keep things in sync.</p>
<p>In this analogy, the brand evolution is like the marathon runner arm.  But the business model planning (the core) is just so weak.  The product rollout is TBD.  The main navigation of the website makes it impossible to find anything (couch potato arm).  Execution is uneven across the DAO, and a bunch of other initiatives that we’re told “are happening, you’d know if you were on the inside, just trust us” but to me from the gov forums they look just like the couch potato arms.</p>

<p>Good work building in public <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/alexalombardo">@alexalombardo</a> - It’s great as someone who isnt very connected in GitcoinDAO to be able to follow the evolution of the Gitcoin brand.

            <p>Love seeing the immense amount of work behind this. I’m particularly a fan of the iceberg graphic (emphasizing how often I see us getting caught up in visuals vs. the strategic work that comes before it).</p>
<p>I think a lot of what has been shared will create a shared reality (through shared language) for what branding is and how we can move forward on a clear, cohesive brand strategy.</p>

So has how we describe our purpose, switching between words like open source, public goods, and most recently, shared needs. In the same vein, as our vernacular has evolved, so has our look and feel. Illustrations have shifted from robots to astronauts, colors have shifted from dark to light to dark again. We’ve also had open forum discussions call attention to our evolving language and visual identity.</p>
<p>Today, we’re at a critical point in our evolution, perhaps as critical as when we unlocked the potential of Quadratic Funding, the mechanism that has to date made our Grants Program so successful. We’ve taken years of learnings and turned insights into action, creating a range of pluralistic tools that can be leveraged at scale, opening unprecedented opportunities for local communities and their supporters to build for global impact.</p>
<p>And with this change - this next phase of our evolution - comes the need to re-look at ourselves, and in particular, our brand - which is much more than our logo and illustration style, it’s the emotional connection that comes from the total sum of expressions by which we’re recognized. Inevitably, as we evolve, so do these expressions. But how?</p>

<a name="first-whats-brand-and-why-does-it-matter-3" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#first-whats-brand-and-why-does-it-matter-3"></a>First, what’s brand and why does it matter?</h1>
<p>The topic of brand – and more specifically, brand strategy – is one that cannot be simplified, especially at a “decentralized brand,” or, as others sometimes refer to it, a “headless brand.”</p>
<p>This section will address:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is Brand</li>
<li>What is a Decentralized Brand</li>
<li>What is Brand Strategy</li>
<li>What is a Decentralized Brand Strategy</li>
<li>Why does Brand Strategy matter</li>
</ul>
<p>The terms brand and brand strategy are frequently used interchangeably. There isn’t always a shared, clear understanding of what they actually mean, or how they’re different from each other. This lack of clarity can sometimes result in misunderstanding – and a communication breakdown around a critical part of any organization or business.</p>
<p>So first goal: define Brand.</p>
<p>For many modern companies, their brand is their single most valuable asset. Nike. Patagonia. Coca Cola. This is also becoming true for many recognizable brands in the web3 space - Uniswap, Aave, Lens, Zora, FWB.</p>
<p>What first comes to mind when you think brand? Probably logo. Maybe color. Maybe typography. But it’s also likely something else; something intangible yet incredibly powerful at the same time. It’s a feeling. It’s the gut reaction that happens when someone thinks of the brand.</p>
<p>It’s not just the logo, the font, the color palette. It’s more than the visual identity (all of those things – logo, font, palette - plus other visual elements like iconography.)</p>
<p>It’s more than the verbal identity (the vernacular or words you use, voice, and tone.)</p>
<p>Brand is the emotional connection that our audience, community and customers have with our organization. It is shaped by our name, logo, overall visual and verbal identity, marketing and advertising, and—most importantly—the experiences customers associate with us. It’s the sum of all expressions by which an entity (person, organization, company, business unit, city, nation, etc.) intends to be recognized.</p>
<p>This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>How people identify us</li>
<li>How we express ourselves</li>
<li>How we create a shared understanding, appreciation or association</li>
<li>…through visual cues like logo, color palette and typography</li>
<li>…through written cues like ownable vernacular</li>
<li>…through memes</li>
<li>…through serial content like blogs, podcasts</li>
<li>…through events and experiences online and off</li>
</ul>
<p>A few things brand has the power to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Garner loyalty</li>
<li>Inspire word-of-mouth marketing</li>
<li>Set you apart from other competitors in the marketplace</li>
<li>Allow you to command premium pricing for your products or services</li>
</ul>
<p>Brand is not in our direct control – it’s in the minds of our community. This is true for all brands, not just decentralized ones. A decentralized brand, as defined by <a href="https://otherinter.net/research/headless-brands/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Other Internet</a>, belongs to no one, and can be remixed by anyone. It’s a meme. It can only be “designed” in a very limited sense. It has its own autonomy, generated by the contributions of individual actors, a million person chorus acting as one.</p>
<p>That said, there are ways we can take action to shape our brand indirectly in order to strengthen it and shift perception.</p>
<p>How do we decide on those actions? How do we even know what kind of brand we want to have? How do we decide how we want to be perceived? How do we help shape the way our community perceives us as a whole? This is where brand strategy comes into play.</p>
<p>Brand strategy is the ‘big picture’ plans and tactics deployed by an organization to create long-term brand equity and competitive advantages from branding.</p>
<p>Aka, it’s:</p>
<ul>
<li>a plan to actively influence how people perceive our brand</li>
<li>clarifies where we’re headed</li>
<li>defines what we’re are trying to achieve</li>
<li>provides a map and compass, setting a True North so to speak, to help us get there</li>
<li>helps us figure out what to do, and perhaps even more importantly, what not to do</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not (important clarification here!)</p>
<ul>
<li>a business strategy, which is also being worked on simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Other Internet, “headless brand strategy is an ecosystemic affair and entails the mobilization of a decentralized set of actors. At its core, it revolves around giving agency to different stakeholders in a way that lets them coordinate more effectively and feel connected to the brand. What projects can do, in this context, is provide the resources, tools, and wayfinding devices for different stakeholders to converge around a single narrative.”</p>
<p>We love a good iceberg meme - here’s one for Brand:</p>

<p>Why is Brand Strategy important?</p>
<ol>
<li>To help us articulate and communicate our core values: People usually buy into why you do what you do before they buy into what you do. To attract and retain loyal contributors we must understand and communicate what we stand for.</li>
<li>To help us identify weaknesses in our brand experience: If the experiences our audiences have interacting with us aren’t consistent, we’ll struggle to build trust and customer loyalty.</li>
<li>To filter out ill-advised ideas that would damage your brand-building efforts: It’s easy to succumb to shiny-object syndrome. A clear brand strategy makes it easier to make prudent decisions.</li>
<li>To create accountability: Committing to a clear brand strategy helps keep everyone in the organization accountable, focused on high-yield initiatives that will actually move the needle. It helps us stay on track.</li>
<li>To focus our marketing efforts: By narrowing and clarifying the scope of your marketing efforts, we can ensure smoother and more effective execution of marketing campaigns. We know who we’re targeting, we know what they care about, and we know how to speak to them.</li>
<li>To help designers and creatives do better, more effective work. Without a strategy to underpin creative decisions, they are inherently subjective and arbitrary.</li>
<li>To align and engage the team in the vision: A major part of the brand strategy process is getting our team to buy into the vision and values of our brand.</li>
</ol>
<p>Components of an effective brand strategy</p>
<ol>
<li>Values: These are the beliefs that inform everything we do.</li>
<li>Vision: The message that speaks to our target audience, telling them what we’re here to do and why we’re here to do it. It tells them what to expect when they interact with our brand.</li>
<li>Mission: A brand mission is how we work towards our vision – or the “how we do it” complement to the “what are we here to do”.</li>
<li>Positioning statement: A positioning statement encompasses all of the above and effectively communicates value proposition to your ideal customer or target audience(s).</li>
<li>Audience: This is who we’re here for - and our target audience should be laser focused.</li>
<li>Voice and tone (as well as specific messaging/vernacular): A framework around how we communicate.</li>
<li>Look and feel of our brand identity: A good strategy can guide the creative expressions of our brand identity to make sure they are aligned with our positioning goals and the tastes of our main audiences.</li>
<li>BONUS!: Prioritized brand touchpoints and awareness-drivers: Brand touchpoints are any points of contact between our business and our audience/users. They can include website, email newsletter, social media accounts, events, and merch—to just name a few.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ultimately, a good brand strategy will help you focus on the most important, high-yield touchpoints to avoid spreading your organization too thin.</p>
<p>When not building a brand from the ground up, there are two ways we can talk about updating Brand Identity. They are brand refresh and rebrand.</p>
<p>A brand refresh is when a brand attempts to modernize its image while maintaining its core identity and strategy. A rebrand is a complete overhaul of the brand’s identity and strategy, typically enacted when the current brand strategy fails.</p>
<p>At Gitcoin, we haven’t had a clearly defined brand strategy informing design in the past, thus it is challenging to objectively say whether or not we’ve succeeded or failed. However, given the success of our Grants Programs, which can be considered our “MVP,” the subsequent initiatives that have succeeded and ultimately “spun out” of Gitcoin, and the brand affinity and equity we’ve established among our core audiences, it is appropriate to say we enter this next phase of our evolution with a range of achievements, and therefore owe attention to past visual and verbal expressions.</p>

<p>Brand Strategies begin with insights and research, which is what we’ve been doing since this initiative kicked off a few months ago. We began the brand evolution work with a <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/uR6hsqSqXS4JUfm17zdNTV/Gitcoin-Brand-Attributes-Workshop?node-id=108%3A386&amp;t=bO2x6z4XTnpNIyaB-1" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">DAO-wide brand attributes workshop</a> during a DAO-vibes takeover. Since then, we’ve conducted numerous discovery interviews, competitive/landscape research and working sessions in order to put pen to paper on a brand strategy that can inform the intentional evolution of those brand expressions - from typography and color palette to tone and merch. And that’s what we’re excited to begin sharing in the hope to kickoff a robust discussion around brand, and answer any questions you might have about this work.</p>
<p>Below summarizes our work to date, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Brand Attributes Workshop</li>
<li>Discovery Interviews</li>
<li>Brand Strategy Audit</li>
<li>Brand Visual Audit</li>
<li>Brand Working Group Work</li>
<li>Market/Competitive Insights</li>
</ol>
<p>All of this is the foundation upon which we’re building a brand strategy. We hope that by sharing this here we can gather any questions and comments that arise and in turn answer them through future discussion forums.</p>
<h2>
<a name="ii-brand-attributes-workshop-5" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#ii-brand-attributes-workshop-5"></a>II. Brand Attributes Workshop</h2>
<p>To kick off the brand evolution work, we hosted a Brand Attributes workshop where we asked the community key questions from which themes started to emerge. These informed the themes we explored further in subsequent working group sessions as well as in key interviews. See FigJam <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/uR6hsqSqXS4JUfm17zdNTV/Gitcoin-Brand-Attributes-Workshop?node-id=108%3A386&amp;t=bO2x6z4XTnpNIyaB-1" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a>.</p>
<p>The TLDR:</p>
<ul>
<li>Questions we asked:
<ul>
<li>What makes us different?</li>
<li>How would others describe us?</li>
<li>How do we sound to others?</li>
<li>What impact will we have?</li>
<li>How do people feel interacting with us?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Themes that emerged:</li>
<li>We are unbound by existing systems</li>
<li>We are hopeful for a better future</li>
<li>We empower people to make positive change</li>
<li>We enable regenerative initiatives</li>
<li>We celebrate the many, not the few</li>
<li>We believe in the power of collaboration over competition</li>
<li>We educate around the value of public goods</li>
<li>We welcome people with open arms</li>
<li>We are leaders not followers</li>
<li>We create foundational infrastructure - things to be built on top of</li>
<li>We help foster more equitable, whole lives</li>
<li>We invest in our community and their communities</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="iii-discovery-interviews-6" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#iii-discovery-interviews-6"></a>III. Discovery Interviews</h2>
<p>Next, we interviewed key thought leaders across the organization, asking them a series of questions that would help us distill key insights (specifically areas of alignment and misalignment), uncover key strategic opportunities, understand history and flag challenges.

<p>The TLDR:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where We Are: We’re in the in between - a state of flux - but we know there’s greatness in our future.</li>
<li>What We Do &amp; Why We Do It: We’re mission aligned and inspired - we empower communities to fund their shared needs. This expansive purpose shapes our product vision.</li>
<li>What &amp; Who We’re Here For: We are for the greater good. We’re human centric and community first - and we build in service of their needs.</li>
<li>What’s Next: Our current brand identity isn’t always serving us - and there are opportunities for us to optimize to make the community feel more connected to our vision. A lot of what’s been done in the past was “yolo’ed,” and we’re ready to be more intentional with our visual and verbal expressions.</li>

<a name="iii-brand-strategy-audit-7" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#iii-brand-strategy-audit-7"></a>III. Brand Strategy Audit</h2>
<p>Simultaneously, we reviewed publicly available expressions of Brand Strategy (Mission, Vision, etc.). As part of our work, we reviewed and referenced our community’s past work - including but not limited to:</p>

<p>The TLDR:</p>
<ul>
<li>Challenge 1: Lack of Cohesive Narrative Across Past, Present &amp; Future: There was no single source for our brand narrative - the where we’ve been, where we are, where we’re going, which made it challenging identify intentional</li>
<li>Challenge 2: Mission Cohesion: expressed in different ways in various places across owned and partner channels</li>
<li>Challenge 3: No Defined Community Aligned Values: our values were never clearly codified for our community - and while they were several iterations of them, none felt wholly embraced</li>
<li>Challenge 4: No Defined Personality Traits: while our brand has a personality, it often feels like an afterthought, and was never specifically defined in a set of traits acknowledged as ours</li>
<li>Challenge 5: Inconsistent Messaging: Overall inconsistencies; Style, tone and comms hierarchy are unclear; often lacking call to action and reliant on descriptive, prescriptive language rather than inspiring or insightful</li>

<p>The TLDR:</p>
<ul>
<li>Challenge 1: Logo Cohesion: There are inconsistencies in how our logo and lockups are used</li>
<li>Challenge 2: The Astronaut (or Robo) as a Symbol: While we use this as a symbol, some of the symbolic elements are misaligned with what we do</li>
<li>Challenge 3: Iconography &amp; Illustration: Iconography style inconsistencies which can create confusion and mistrust</li>
<li>Challenge 4: Website Visual Impact: Across certain touchpoints, we’ve intentionally created moments for users to feel connected and engaged with the overall experience - but interactive elements are inconsistent and lack relevance to our messages/intentions</li>
<li>Challenge 5: Inconsistencies Across Product &amp; Protocol: “Vibe” inconsistencies across product and protocols</li>

<a name="v-brand-working-group-10" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#v-brand-working-group-10"></a>V. Brand Working Group</h2>
<p>We created a smaller working group (a precursor to what we’re now calling Pods - comprised of cross-workstream contributors) to begin ideating around Brand Strategy that builds upon our existing Brand Purpose, creating a cohesive Brand Narrative - giving us more clarity around key strategic elements and considerations that can inform the evolution of our visual identity.</p>
<p>To better understand our process, visit our <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPWmsSIM=/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Brand Evolution Board</a></p>
<p>The TLDR:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our aim was to begin to define how we would align the DAO around a set of common values and objectives so we can collectively do a better job in allocating resources, setting priorities, executing, and evolving towards a shared “North Star.”</li>
<li>Here, we looked closely at the role of audience within the strategy, reviewing past surveys to understand audience needs and where their current affinities lie</li>
<li>We examined our product pipeline and positioning to better understand where we fit in the market today and where we’re going</li>
<li>We took into consideration our own organization - the DAO - and what that means in relation to brand strategy</li>
<li>We began to define our mission, vision and values, the foundation of the brand strategy</li>
<li>Last, we shared this work with a bigger working group for feedback, as well as with Design contributors in order to begin looking at design considerations - and that’s where we are today!</li>

<a name="vi-marketcompetitive-insights-11" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#vi-marketcompetitive-insights-11"></a>VI. Market/Competitive Insights</h2>
<p>While we strive for originality, we must also take into consideration market trends and forces as well as what our “competitors” are saying and doing. This helps us ensure we’ve got an edge but are also remaining top of the game. <a href="https://app.pitch.com/app/public/player/9749f0af-186a-4774-becb-0ff13c28a05c" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Here’s</a> a summary of our findings.</p>

<p>With this foundational work completed, we’re looking to define our Brand Strategy. The Brand Strategy is not meant to be overly prescriptive. Rather, it aims to offer a framework as well as a set of tools that should give contributors and the community a clear sense of direction. It also helps to inform design development and decisions.</p>
<p>This diagram sums up our process and where we are (definition):</p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/5/50b51c5c0573fb62007a11546e642755f5a1e1dd.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/bvYdZyoU0ZeqjaL24dPIQlUqkep.png?dl=1" title="" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/5/50b51c5c0573fb62007a11546e642755f5a1e1dd_2_663x227.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="bvYdZyoU0ZeqjaL24dPIQlUqkep" width="663" height="227" role="presentation" srcset="/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/5/50b51c5c0573fb62007a11546e642755f5a1e1dd_2_663x227.png, /uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/5/50b51c5c0573fb62007a11546e642755f5a1e1dd_2_994x340.png 1.5x, /uploads/db4391/original/2X/5/50b51c5c0573fb62007a11546e642755f5a1e1dd.png 2x" data-dominant-color="DDE0E5"></a></div><p></p>
<p>We’ll be sharing the Brand Strategy for commentary soon, and appreciate any and all feedback.</p>
<p>Once we’ve aligned on the Brand Strategy, we will use it as a lens through which to continuously evaluate and refine design.</p>
<p>From a design perspective, our goals will be to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strengthen the connection to Gitcoin across everything we do</li>
<li>Capitalize on our strongest brand equities</li>
<li>Modernize the look and feel of the brand</li>
<li>Drive consistency and reduce complexity</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether or not we move forward with a brand refresh, rebrand, or something in between is up to us - the main goal is to ensure there is intentionality behind our design elements, and that we feel confident our brand expressions uphold our strategy.</p>
<p>Lastly, it’s important to note that our brand is a living and breathing thing, and none of this work is meant to be overly prescriptive - instead, it should feel organically aligned with shifts happening in other areas of the organization as they relate to the ways in which we activate against our mission and vision. Simultaneously, it should also act as a membrane, not as a hard shell. We want to build a brand that feels inviting and inclusive enough for contributors to take it and turn it into something outside our wildest dreams in order to inspire greater affinity and connection across our audiences.</p>
