[S16 Proposal] INTEGRATED DAO Operations Budget Request
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s16-proposal-integrated-dao-operations-budget-request/11811
    # Essential Intent

During Season 16 (S16), DAO Operations will focus on the following Essential Intents (EI) within the DAO:

* DAO Organization
* Protocol Adoption
* Program Success

# TL;DR

DAO Ops continues to evolve our service model in service delivery of our workstream partners and cross stream collaboration. In S16, we will continue to support key initiatives to support contributor professional development, and with budget increases to support the success of our Grants Program and Protocol development. Also, in light of recent shifts in our community engagement strategy, we will be winding down our Community Experience initiative to focus even more on cross-stream collaboration, accountability and project management across the DAO.

Based on what we learned in S15, we will be focusing our resources on supporting DAO and contributor success vis-a-vis our cross-stream DAO operations, governance, tooling, people operations and success initiatives.

# Amount

DAO Ops requests $348,260 USD in S16. Included in the budget is a placeholder for a Technical Support hire to support our Design Partner Program and 2 months of parental leave for 1 contributor. This request does not include the additional 60 days of reserves per season. A breakdown of the full budget can be found at the end of this proposal.

|Season|Season 13|Season 14|Season 15|Season 16|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Season Budget |$450,000|$608,308|$293,000 |$348,260
Season Reserves |$0|$405,539|$188,585|$232,173
Unspent Reserves % *1)*|15%|123.47%|12%| N/A
Treasury Request *2)*|$450,000|$947,846| -$261,423| $558,433

*1)* The amount of GTC requested and the value of the reserves will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally using the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average, whichever is lower.

*2)* The Treasury Request amount is an estimate using the price of $1.66 GTC to calculate the total of the reserves rolled over from Season 15.

<p><strong>In general we are going backwards with the approach in budgeting.</strong></p>
<p>We should say how much GTC and DAI we are willing to spend each quarter, given our current holdings and the macro outlook, divide that up amongst the working groups and <strong>live within our means</strong>. This is how we need to build a budget for the DAO in the bear.</p>
<p>Right now we don‚Äôt actually have a budget, our process (cynically) looks like this: Each working group spends way too much time trying to sell their work in forums and calls, then they put out a number that gets nickel and dime‚Äôd by a bunch of stewards that don‚Äôt have enough of an incite to really judge the request and then it gets approved eventually and we spend whatever, with no concern (at least outwardly) about how the increase in supply is going to be met with demand.</p>
<p>^^^ This is a fine pattern in a bull market where the macro environment can generate tangential demand‚Ä¶ that is not where we are right now.</p>

[S16 Proposal] INTEGRATED DAO Operations Budget Request
safder

            <p>I appreciate the thoughtful engagement here Griff, and I‚Äôm very much in alignment with the need to minimize costs. On compensation/hiring, we recently went through the process of developing a compensation model in collaboration with workstreams, one that aligns incentives with performance and accountability. Currently the DAO Ops, FDD, and MMM workstreams are using this new performance-based compensation model.</p>
<p>As Jodi mentioned, this model uses the US median for base salary numbers from the data provided by OpenComp, which aggregates salary data from hundreds of companies in its database. The base numbers here are pretty reasonable, and NOT meant to be competitive with FAANG/high CoL area tech salaries. One reason we use US numbers, and it makes sense for us to continue to do so, is that a majority of our full-time contributors are US-based. It would not be prudent to lay off and attempt to replace our entire workforce with contributors from lower CoL regions. I would note here that the costs of replacing a strong employee/contributor can be much higher than potential benefits of rehiring someone at half the cost. <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/247391/fixable-problem-costs-businesses-trillion.aspx" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Here</a> is a good read on the costs associated with turnover, and there is a lot of research that has been done on this.</p>
<p>That being said, what is important is ensuring that compensation makes sense for the skills/experience/value each contributor is bringing to the DAO by having high levels of accountability, and I think this is an area the DAO could definitely improve. This is what the compensation model attempts to solve, as well as potentially some of the budget auditing work <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/shawn16400">@shawn16400</a> is looking into.</p>
<p>Would love to continue working with you as well as other Stewards in exploring how we can continue to ensure that we‚Äôre only taking what we need from the treasury in the ongoing market conditions.</p>

Jodi_GitcoinDAO

            <p>We appreciate you naming these concerns. For our part, in S15, People Operations rolled out a compensation framework that tried to balance fiscal responsibility with the ability to attract value-aligned talent. Based on those recommendations, most workstreams (including DAO Operations) re-leveled contributor pay to 50% of U.S. median salary. This ensures that all contributors, regardless of where they live, are paid the same for the same work.</p>

</aside>
<p>As for our value to the organization: our commitments to the DAO remained largely unchanged in S16 in accordance with CSDO‚Äôs decision to keep planning to a minimum this season. That said, DAO Ops is a service-oriented team that is constantly responding to the needs of the DAO. That means that in addition to the commitments listed above, we are also assessing a number of projects that stewards, workstream leads and contributors have already raised since the start of the season, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>an updated treasury dashboard</li>
<li>contributor pay survey</li>
<li>creation of a CSDO charter</li>
<li>Facilitated strategy sessions to set the DAO‚Äôs operating system and set value proposition as a protocol and grant giving DAO.</li>

<p>what was going on between S13 &amp; S14 that led to dramatically large jumps in % unspent?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Our first two seasons as a workstream included a couple key personnel moves, including several contributors transitioning to the DAO from Holdings. A couple of those moves took longer to occur than planned, which led to larger than expected rollovers at the end of each season. Then, ahead of of S15, four contributors left DAO Operations and excess funds in our multisig were returned to the DAO‚Äôs treasury (about $270k).</p>

<li>An updated CSDO charter and DAO OS with clear metrics</li>
<li>A streamlined budget process that balances planning with execution, and borrows from best practices in the broader ecosystem.</li>
<li>Experimentation with workstream coordination that improves internal communications and project management (i.e., working in cross stream pod or guild structures).</li>
</ul>
<p>Each is listed as a DAO Ops project commitment this season.</p>

[S16 Proposal] INTEGRATED DAO Operations Budget Request

            <p>I meant that I am going to take a harder stance in general and vote no on all the proposals this round. Sadly I missed the FDD vote and left a yes vote on the Product team. It‚Äôs definitely my bad for not getting that all in correctly, but 'm not sure why these votes were scheduled with different lengths of voting time‚Ä¶ :-/</p>
<p>Either way, the stance isn‚Äôt going to stop anything this round it seems. But I‚Äôm planning on voting no across the board until we see serious budget cuts, and next season I will rally more support for this across the stewards group if there isn‚Äôt a change.</p>

            <p>I agree with Lefteris. Though I am going to make a harder stand and vote no on this budget request and every other one as well.</p>
<p>We need to make cuts and the only way the stewards can signal it is by voting no.</p>
<p>Voting no on all work streams until we get our spending under control is the only thing I can do at this point, and I hope other Stewards will follow suit. We have given strong warnings over the last few seasons and they don‚Äôt seem to be enough.</p>
<p>We cannot spend this much money in this market, it is a bad strategy.</p>
<p>I am happy to work with the Gitcoin Hiring team to explain how Giveth finds intrinsically motivated high caliber contributors in lower income countries to keep our budget at 1/10th of the cost.</p>

            <p>Hey thanks a lot for the proposal.</p>
<p>I have some comments here. I am not really convinced in how important this workstream‚Äôs work is for the operation of the DAO which is bleeding a very big amount of funds in the most severe bear market we have seen in years.</p>
<p>I am happy to see that you have unspent reserves from S15.<br>
I am not happy to see an increase in budget request during such market conditions. If I compare the salaries you guys pay they are higher than I have ever made as an opensource developer, even in good market times.</p>
<p>I am also trying to understand and judge what exactly does the DAO gain from this workstream. Looking at the S16 commitments and the outcomes and initiatives I just don‚Äôt see any of these as actually important, except perhaps the Support section which is indeed something Gitcoin should have.</p>
<p>As things currently stand I will have to vote No in this proposal with the feedback being to recognize the terrible state of the market and the industry and adjust the budget accordingly. And to also keep only the stuff that is absolutely essential to the DAO and shed everything else.</p>

            <p>It was great connecting! I read the considerations you laid out in your governance post and agree to a degree that coordinating our resources and developing metrics to track our progress are essential to a successful transition.</p>
<p>For our part our budget is flat with exception for one hire to support our protocol work. We‚Äôre starting the process now to keep pace with the DevRel initiative and Design Partner launches happening this season.</p>
<p>I also see cause optimism. As I shared in our 1:1, the workstream coordination continues to improve ‚Äì we‚Äôre asking each other better questions, which in turn is building our strategy muscles.  The risks you lay out are good call outs, and ones we‚Äôre all thinking about.</p>
<p>Either way, I hope we can count on your support this budget cycle. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

Very excited that there continues to be many improvements and continued planning around increasing Steward engagement and the simplification of key processes. I see that $20,000 is marked for professional development. What sort of continued education is planned for DAO contributors? Or does everyone choose what they want to do individually on their own?</p>

            <p>Hi Jodi - again thank you for our conversations and for educating me about DAO ops and about Gitcoin itself.  It was a pleasure working with you on this budget review.  Thank you for your patience with me.</p>
<p>On the whole - at the risk of being a lonely voice in the wilderness - I think we should consider whether the DAO is leaning forward too aggressively given unavoidable risks.</p>

            <p>This is a great call out. Recent OS insights extend well beyond the facilitation of meetings, and Kris and I sense the need for DAO Ops to take lead prioritizing how we build the overall canvas, document agreements, and implement any changes that come out of these conversations.</p>

<p>Maybe I‚Äôm not knowledgeable around this, but I am quite surprised to see that Gitcoin DAO still doesn‚Äôt have a HR department. Or is each WS supposed to have it? I honestly don‚Äôt know, sorry!</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>We do have an ‚ÄòHR department‚Äô in a way, in the sense that we have People Ops as an initiative within DAO Ops. Next to this each workstream also has a talent coordinator who syncs with the People Ops team. It‚Äôs a smaller ‚Äòcentralized‚Äô team within daoops, but we support all needs within each workstream as good as we can and based on feedback we adapt what people ops means exactly for Gitcoin. Hope this helps!</p>
