[Proposal] Retroactive GTC Allocation to Lead Engineer of Gitcoin Grants V1
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-retroactive-gtc-allocation-to-lead-engineer-of-gitcoin-grants-v1/9343
    ** **This proposal has been edited to reflect the conversation in the comments section** ** - 1:23pm MT 12/6/21

1. **Summary** 

This proposal is to retroactively allocate an appropriate number of GTC tokens to Kevin Seagraves, the lead engineer and product manager for Gitcoin Grants V1. Gitcoin Grants has become core to the Gitcoin platform and a staple in the Ethereum ecosystem having distributed ~$16M to open source projects at the time of GTC creation. I was allocated and claimed ~327.778 GTC for the [bounties I paid out](https://gitcoin.co/captnseagraves/spent) while building out Gitcoin Grants, but I did not receive a stakeholder allocation for core contributors as mentioned in the article [announcing the creation of GTC](https://gitcoin.co/blog/introducing-gtc-gitcoins-governance-token/) or a GMV allocation in the community airdrop for the work of actually building Gitcoin Grants. 

2. **Abstract** 

I am the [7th leading contributor to Gitcoin](https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/graphs/contributors?from=2017-07-09&to=2021-12-05&type=a) by lines of code, contributing 47,747 lines for Gitcoin Grants V1. Gitcoin Grants has emerged as one of the leading products in the Gitcoin portfolio and has [distrubted $22.76m in funding](https://gitcoin.co/results) to open source projects at the time of writing. Gitcoin's mission is to "Grow Open Source" and I believe my work has contributed significantly to executing on that mission. 

3. **Motivation** 

I LOVE Gitcoin. I was one of the first contributors to Gitcoin having co-authored the original Bounties smart contracts with Kevin Owocki, reviewing Kevin's never-released whitepaper, and reviewing the logo design and color palette back in 2017. I came back to Gitcoin and built an industry-leading product with Gitcoin Grants. I wrote the [requirement for the beloved Bot Learning To Love meme](https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/issues/2082). I would LOVE to have a stake and continue to contribute to the Gitcoin Community and DAO.

4. **Specification** 

This proposal can be fulfilled via a transaction from the GitcoinDAO treasury or other appropriate store of funds to captnseagraves.eth based on the calculation below. 

GMV Allocation - Calculate a GMV allocation based on the funds I was paid to build Gitcoin Grants. The project was [originally a bounty](https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/issues/1469), but was so large in scope I was paid as a contract and not on the platform. Thus it was not calculated as part of the airdrop and I did not recieve tokens for this work done. Based on my tax returns, which I am happy to provide to select individuals if needed, I was paid a total of $29430 for my work on Gitcoin Grants. Based on the following equation and math: 

*Formula:* GMV per user / GMV Total * GMV Allocation Percent

29430 / 22,000,000 * 10,800,000 = 14447.4545455

I feel retroactive allocation of 14447.4545455 GTC would be appropriate.  

5. **Benefits** 

The Gitcoin ecosystem can uphold and ensure the integrity of its mission to "Grow Open Source" and appropriately reward one of its oldest and most prolific contributors. It can set a positive precedent to reward individuals who have added significant value to the ecosystem in the past and who were passed by earlier this year in the GTC creation event. 

The ecosystem will empower one of its biggest supporters to continue contributing in meaningful ways. 

6. **Drawbacks** 

These funds may come from the DAO Treasury rather than from the original token airdrop allocation.

7. **Vote** 

This proposal consists of two votes (I would provide snapshot votes, but do not currently have enough GTC to submit a snapshot proposal):

* The first is to approve the retroactive allocation of GTC to Kevin Seagraves the lead engineer of Gitcon Grants V1: 
[poll type=multiple results=always min=1 max=2 chartType=bar]
# Approve retroactive allocation of 14447.4545455 GTC to Kevin Seagraves
* Yes
* No
[/poll]



**Appreciation**

Beyond all this token business, I am so grateful to the Gitcoin team for their friendship and everything they have enabled me to do in my career. Thanks @owocki @vivekmsignh @ceresstation @Pixelant @octavioamu @thelostone-mc @frankchen07 @austingriffith, and everyone else in the gitcoin fam, for everything. Much Love :robot: :heart:

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/captnseagraves">@captnseagraves</a> Thank you for posting this and sharing your thoughts.  I have not heard anything from Kevin other than on this forum.  I personally don‚Äôt consider it case closed.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm in a similar boat here, except that I did engage with the <a href="http://gitcoin.co" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">gitcoin.co</a> bounties before I met Kevin personally.  I contributed to bounties as early as November and December of 2017.  Once I started to get more involved with Gitcoin, I wanted to play a bigger role.  At that point I was put under contract with Gitcoin rather than going through the bounty system.</p>
<p>As a contractor, I worked for Gitcoin for longer than 6 months - my records indicate I was involved with Gitcoin for about a full year.  I contributed to the gitcoin/web codebase and launched Kudos V1 - which involved leading the project, writing the backend code, and writing and deploying the solidity contract.</p>
<p>I share the sentiment of <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/captnseagraves">@captnseagraves</a> and feel that the allocation of GTC does not truly represent the contributions of the community members, and contractors are being left out in the cold.</p>
<p>So to address the 4 items:</p>
<p>1 and 2 don‚Äôt apply to me.  3 and 4 seem like easy outs to not address the issue at hand.  How many people are going to come out of the woodwork? It seems like some of the biggest contributors were these contractors, and in those days there were only a handful working on the project.</p>

            <p>Happy 2022 everyone! Wanted to give an update to the community. I received this email from <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a> this morning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey Kevin,</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience as we worked through this discussion over the holidays.</p>
<p>We (Gitcoin Holdings Leadership) decided that we‚Äôre not in support of this proposal (or a variant that rewards past contractors) at this time.  I understand this is not the outcome you wanted to hear.  I‚Äôll do my best to capture the discussion below.</p>
<p>The primary reasons we decided not to support:</p>
<ol>
<li>You and I didn‚Äôt meet on the platform or do any of the engagement on the platform, and so it‚Äôs not appropriate to treat our engagement like it should be retro distribution for platform usage.</li>
<li>You didn‚Äôt stay at gitcoin for the cliff time (6 months), so it‚Äôs not appropriate to treat it like you‚Äôre a full time employee or long term contractor allocation.</li>
<li>The proposal is not in the best interest of the community, it‚Äôs only in the best interest of a small handful of people.</li>
<li>Supporting the proposal would set a precedent for people to come out of the woodwork and ask for distributions, and that‚Äôs not in the best interest of the community.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The message went on to include a personal note as Kevin and I have been friends since 2017 and still see each other regularly in the Boulder, CO community.</p>
<p>While the Gitcoin Holding recommendation is unfortunate for myself and other early contractors, and I disagree with the outcome, I will accept it moving forward.</p>
<p>I will respond to the points above and then I will consider this matter resolved:</p>
<hr>
<p>I seem to fall in an edge case that is just not worth it to have included in the community/GitcoinDAO governance.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Yes, this is the exception I was proposing for early contractors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My records indicate that the first day I submitted an invoice for work was 7/20/18 and my last day submitted for work was 2/22/19. 8 months in total. If 6 months was the cliff, then it appears that I do qualify for a long-term contractor allocation. Regardless, crypto-winter hit and I left because it was unclear whether there would be funding for me in the next month, let alone whether ConsenSys would consider hiring me full time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>3 &amp; 4. What I hear in these statements is, this edge case of early contractors wasn‚Äôt included in the original token drop and is now too politically costly to address.</p>
<p>There is no comment on the quality or value of the work contributed, which seemed to be a significant point of conversation in the thread above. Perhaps it wasn‚Äôt valuable work to lead the effort on Gitcoin Grants v1.</p>
<p>This outcome seems misaligned with Gitcoin‚Äôs core mission and how it has rewarded contributors on its platform in the past.</p>
<hr>
<p>However, the community asked for Gitcoin Holdings‚Äô recommendation and this is the result. I am happy to live with that.</p>
<p>Thank you everyone for the time, effort, and thought you put into this proposal. It really does show the willingness to govern and work together on issues. I am truly grateful to be a part of this community.</p>
<p>I wish Kevin, the Gitcoin Holdings team, the GitcoinDAO and platform, and all those working to provide public goods the best of luck and the highest success. I will always support you. I will always be your friend and advocate.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Kevin</p>

            <p>I think that this will end up being the most reasonable conclusion given the relatively small scope.</p>
<p>And I‚Äôd say you succeed in being deferential to stewards ‚Äì if the stewards feel the scope is too small for a wider judgement (2 potential claimants), then it really is the best decision to then defer back to you/gitcoin holdings internal team. There isnt really any conflict of interest or centralizing risk given steward request and limited scope.</p>
<p>My more general thoughts:<br>
Its clear there appears there is a consensus that there should be <em>some</em> reward. It seems the issue that <span class="mention">@lefteris</span> /folks have is largely with the size of the claim rather than a claim itself.</p>
<p>That said, internal context within gitcoin is probably necessary to judge where kevins work sits on the spectrum / how much compensation is reasonable. + I think context regarding any potential implication of future equity whenever Kevin‚Äôs employment began is probably necessary as well (even if just implied in the company‚Äôs ethos).</p>
<p>Other context is of course the other people that were rewarded. I feel I received an absurd amount of GTC, what equates to a bit over $120,000 though it was largely because I hit many qualifiers (Kernel Participant &amp; Mentor, large donator, large grant recipient).</p>
<p>Have my contributions been more than Kevin? Honestly, who knows, but probably not. I have contributed quite a lot in small ways over time, and I do not personally know the details of his contribution + can personally speak to how horrible LOC is for a metric (my first project was, a disgusting 20,000 line rebalancing tool/python GUI), so its hard to say. All this said I personally err on over-rewarding past/potential contributors, rather than potentially undercompensating them.</p>

I agree with comments made by lefteris, linda, griff &amp; trent.</p>
<p>Ideally check with the holdings team first what they think would be appropriate as a possible extra compensation plus who else is in your position and can receive this compensation as well, and then I‚Äôd definitely would support this.</p>

            <p>Very interesting discussion, I was trying to follow all the points and seems all very valid.<br>
I want to bring some points as a core developer for like 3 years in Gitcoin, because not sure how that will affect or not in the calcs or if even I would be benefit by the proposal.</p>
<p>I started first as a user on Gitcoin, then moved as a contractor (I was the front end dev on Kudos v1 the other one was Jason)  and after some time got hired, first as contractor then as core dev. In the next 3 years worked with every product on gitcoin (very proud of it <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=10" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> )</p>
<p>Today Im not longer a Gitcoin core dev I vested part of my vesting tokens but I wasn‚Äôt part of the airdrop either because I was a core dev at token launch time. By contract my tokens will be locked for one year more so I don‚Äôt own any <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/confused.png?v=10" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>Of course I was paid for all the work I done here and very glad and grateful to be worked on Gitcoin, but at the same time looking on what is fair or not I understand <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/captnseagraves">@captnseagraves</a> feelings, I started when the team was really small, the product was only bounties so I feel I could add more value to the community, of course ‚Äúadding value‚Äù not necessary is attached to the amount of tokens, but I do feel makes part of the feeling of ‚Äúbelong‚Äù.</p>
<p>About the formula, I feel is very relative when talking about contractors or employee and not sure if should be based on the amount received as I feel is not a good validator of value added.  I feel time based is strong way to measure dedication to a project.</p>
<p>Again, my intention here is bringing ‚Äúthe feelings from the other side‚Äù I will be happy on any decision.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>‚Ä¶ and it feels more of a Gitcoin holdings company matter that should be discussed privately and then proposed to the DAO rather than the stewards deciding.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Again here I feel it unfair on the stewards and the DAO to have to deal with ‚Äúdirty laundry‚Äù of Gitcoin holdings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was initially trying to be as deferential to the stewards as possible.  But it seems from the comments above that a few of them are asking what Gitcoin Holdings recommendation is.  If I am reading that correctly, then I can bring this up in our next Leadership meeting + come back w. a recommendation from that group.</p>

            <p>I also have a similar sentiment as Lefteris and Trent. I don‚Äôt feel I have the full context for this as a steward and it feels more of a Gitcoin holdings company matter that should be discussed privately and then proposed to the DAO rather than the stewards deciding.</p>

<p>The one year stakeholder guideline makes sense as long as it was applied equally, which it seems like it was. The rule was by time spent contributing, not rank of contributions, or lines of code.

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The one year stakeholder guideline is not being broken in this proposal request. In my understanding contractors never qualified for a stakeholder allocation. Also, the proposal has moved away from rank of contributions or lines of code as a measure of value-added based on the discussion with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/lefterisjp">@lefterisjp</a> above.</p>
<p>The current proposal is:</p>

I propose these contractors are allocated tokens as if the funds they were paid were transacted on the Gitcoin platform as a Bounty or a Grant, like the thousands of other developers who worked and earned on Gitcoin.</p>

<p>This keeps a very narrow scope and maintains the established rule of the GMV allocation which allocated tokens based on a bounty being accepted and funds being paid.</p>

<p>One benefit from my above-proposed allocation method, looking at value paid out to contractors as if it were a bounty, is that it is a true/false outcome. Was the bounty accepted and was value paid out to the person delivering the Bounty? This was the metric for all other GMV Allocations.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The only exception in this proposal is to consider the work contractors submitted to Gitcoin Holdings as a bounty completed on the Gitcoin platform. This treats them the same as the thousands of other developers who worked and earned on Gitcoin and who were allocated tokens in the GMV airdop. I believe those that built core products like Gitcoin Grants v1 and Gitcoin Kudos v1, should be afforded the same opportunity to participate in GitcoinDAO governance.</p>
<p>I am currently in discussion with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a> offline to see if other former contractors elect to opt-in to this proposal as well.</p>

            <p>This is tough to judge as a steward given we do not have the entire context from that time. echoing Lefteris‚Äô comments as well.</p>
<p>The one year stakeholder guideline makes sense as long as it was applied equally, which it seems like it was. The rule was by time spent contributing, not rank of contributions, or lines of code.

<p>For that reason, I am leaning towards not supporting this proposal.</p>

<p>I am not exactly sure how the token was architected so I may be wrong here, but my understanding is that the DAO ultimately allocated and issued GTC. In any case, the DAO now has full control over allocating GTC, so my request is to the DAO. Gitcoin Holdings did pay me out as a contractor, so there isn‚Äôt an unpaid debt. I was a contractor paid to build Gitcoin Grants just like the thousands of other work-for-hire jobs found and paid out via Bounties and Grants, but unlike those other thousands of jobs done I was not allocated GTC in the airdrop because the value I was paid did not transact on Gitcoin. I built the platform that was used to allocate tokens but was not allocated tokens myself.</p>

<p>I am the <span class="hashtag-raw">#7</span> contributor to Gitcoin by lines of code added at 44,747. You are looking at commits, which in my opinion is not as good of a measure of value-added. Commits can also be squashed and the number displayed can be lowered. That is in fact what happened a number of times with Gitcoin Grants to my recollection. Mark Beacom squashed commits to keep the record smaller. I can also change one character, create a commit, and push it to Github, manipulating this number. With lines of code, if there is a linter enforced, this cannot happen in a non-standardized way across all contributors.</p>

</aside>
<p>It was paid work, just like all of the other thousands of developers who were found and paid out for work via Gitcoin Bounties and Grants. All of those developers were allocated tokens in addition to the money they earned on Gitcoin. Surely, building Gitcoin Grants, the platform many of those individuals used and were allocated tokens for using, merits at least the same class of token allocation. As I shared above, it was 6 months of work.</p>

<p>Agreed. That is why I propose only considering contractors who performed significant work for Gitcoin Holdings early on, were not provided a stakeholder allocation, and were not paid out on Gitcoin and so did not receive a GMV allocation in the airdrop. To my knowledge, there is only one other candidate, the author of Gitcoin Kudos V1. Perhaps there are 1 or 2 others. I propose these contractors are allocated tokens as if the funds they were paid were transacted on the Gitcoin platform as a Bounty or a Grant, like the thousands of other developers who worked and earned on Gitcoin.</p>
<p>I plan on reaching out to the other top contributors to Gitcoin in the next few days to see if any of them were contractors in the past and fit the above description. If they self-identify Gitcoin Holdings should be able to confirm their contractor status or not without any privacy issues.</p>
<p>This sets a very high bar for the retroactive allocation, with a small number of significant early contributors, using the same allocation mechanism that the airdrop employed.</p>
<p>In sum, my request is to be included in the governance of the platform I helped build. I believe my work has contributed greatly to the mission of ‚ÄúGrowing Open Source‚Äù and has helped facilitate funding for thousands of developers. It is unfortunate that a small few‚Äôs early work, that every holder of GTC has benefited from, was not allocated tokens. This is an opportunity to rectify that. I am asking that my work be recognized by the community and to be granted the same opportunity to participate like everyone else.</p>

            <p>Hmm few things from me.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair for stewards to have to be called to make a decision here, especially if it involves business of Gitcoin Holdings back in 2018.</p>
<p>I think this should be discussed (1) in private with Gitcoin holdings and then if something is agreed (2) a proposal to the DAO that has the support of <strong>and a lot more details</strong> from Gitcoin holdings.</p>
<p>Followup questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>This could be considered an ‚Äúunpaid debt‚Äù of Gitcoin holdings. Not the DAO. Why does Gitcoin DAO have to take it over? Are there any more such debts? As an active DAO participant and someone who wants to put the DAO‚Äôs interests first I would really like to know the answer to the question.</li>

            <p>I have supported a few airdrops at this point and know it‚Äôs impossible to get it right‚Ä¶ If we can get a list of contractors and its greater than 10, then i would support a proposal to reward them.</p>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/captnseagraves">@captnseagraves</a>, I hope you are doing well!</p>
<p>I think Gitcoin Grants are one of the ‚ÄúCore Function‚Äù of Gitcoin and many of us has had benefits from close or far either while having a Grant and receiving funding or in my case I was able to get some dRewards from the ‚ÄúGrants Reviewing‚Äù Squad with GitcoinDAO because I was working on the grants approval.</p>
<p>I would like to personally say thank you because the grant system had a huge impact over the community and around Gitcoin ecosystems <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I would like to see more comments from each Stewards in this post so we can debate around this request.</p>
<p>My suggestion at this point would be to have an overlook at other participants or ‚ÄúCore contributors‚Äù from <a href="https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/commits/master" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Commits ¬∑ gitcoinco/web ¬∑ GitHub</a> + <a href="https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/graphs/contributors" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Contributors to gitcoinco/web (github.com)</a> and from what I see there is a few that deserve some rewards or that have similar contributions.</p>
<p>This post is similar to the artist behind moonshot bots.<br>
There is another option instead of digging into the treasury, we could either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chip-in 250$-500$ each, let‚Äôs say you have 100 contributors this is 25-50K$ Witch is a nice bonus I think.</li>
<li>You open a grant, and we contribute to your grant‚Ä¶ Unknown amount of funding but it might be interesting</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other side, it could be also interesting to know if you were a paid contractor at that moment, or simply contributing to open-source projects/software</p>
<ul>
<li>If you did agree on a certain amount to build the grants system, then I think it‚Äôs not appropriate to ask for more funding or rewards afterward.</li>
</ul>
<p>If not, we might want to consider a retro-active airdrop for you or debate in the option mentioned above.</p>
<p>This is only my own opinion and I would like to see more comments from other Stewards.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a> My apologies for making an assertion on behalf of others. I have asked those that I spoke with to post here.</p>
<p>I will wait to initiate any process with Gitcoin holding until we see support from stewards.</p>
<p>I seem to have lost the ability to update the body of the proposal. Is there a way for me to regain that ability?</p>

            <p>hey all, im busy working on fighting another fire right now so please excuse my somewhat flippant response.</p>
<p>kevin - can you please ask the stewards who felt this was worth being put up to a vote comment here?  it is not appropriate for you as the proposal submitter to make that assertation on their behalf.</p>
<p>i can‚Äôt publicly disclose who worked for gitcoin/consensys during its early days publicly for privacy reasons.  i could check with legal about starting a process that discloses it, but that will take time and resources from the holdings company - please email me <a href="mailto:kevin@gitcoin.co">kevin@gitcoin.co</a> to kickstart that process if its something you want to pursue‚Ä¶   meantime, if you want to see who contributed to the codebase through the years, i recommend looking at the commit graph at <a href="https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/commits/master" class="inline-onebox">Commits ¬∑ gitcoinco/web ¬∑ GitHub</a> - it contains information about who built the product through the years, regardless of how the engagement was structured (full time, contractors, platform users, all treated equally).</p>
<p>IMHO per the <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-dao-governance-process-v2-updated/7860">governance process</a> you will want to update the body of the proposal with the final list of names, addresses, + allocation amounts before this can go to vote</p>

            <p>An update on this. I received feedback from a few stewards via direct messages that this proposal makes initial sense and is worth putting to a community vote. It identifies a hole in GTC token allocations for contractors who performed work for Gitcoin Core that did not stay long enough for a 1-year cliff (stakeholder allocations) and were not paid out on the Gitcoin platform (GMV allocations). However, if a proposal like this were to go through it should make sure to cover all individuals in this situation.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal update</strong>: This proposal is to retroactively allocate GTC to contractors who performed work for Gitcoin Core that did not stay long enough for a 1-year cliff and were not paid out on the Gitcoin platform. It will calculate a token allocation based on the compensation previously paid out as if those funds were distributed via a Bounty or a Grant on the Gitcoin platform. This will provide the contractors with the same opportunity for involvement in GitcoinDAO goverance that the many other devs who performed work-for-hire jobs on the Gitcoin platform, and who received a GTC allocation, enjoy.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a> Were there other contractors that contributed to Gitcoin that did not stay long enough for a 1-year cliff and were not paid out via the Gitcoin platform? If so, can you share their names and contact info here or in a private message so that I can reach out and coordinate around this proposal?</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a> In a different proposal, it was shared that $22,000,000 was the GMV number at the time of GTC creation and the appropriate value to use for the GMV allocation calculation. So, is this equation correct?</p>
<p>GMV per user / 22,000,000 * 10,800,000 = Users GMV allocation</p>
<p>or when you say</p>

</aside>
<p>do you mean real-time when tokens were claimed? So, 22,000,000 would be outdated.</p>
