     **Disclosure:** I work at Commonwealth.

Hey everyone,
As per @DisruptionJoe 's suggestion, I'm putting this here.
**Summary**
The MMM workstream should engage in discussions with Commonwealth on potentially migrating from Discourse to Commonwealth.

**Motivation**
Discourse can't accommodate a lot of the governance tooling that Gitcoin is working on is working on, such as the steward report cards, and seasonal POAPs for contributors, etc.  

In that sense, I think it makes sense to explore Commonwealth forums as a replacement for Discourse. 

Commonwealth as a tl;dr is Discourse but better since it's crypto native. We already have dYdX and Edgeware on the platform.

Here is a 1 pager that goes more into detail: https://www.notion.so/hicommonwealth/About-Commonwealth-a51086d5abf944bf92019d683c8498ff

Pros:
- Explore migration to a platform that is more crypto-native and can better integrate with Gitcoin

Cons:
- Nothing

            <p>Hey fred,<br>
Notion and Discord would continue. Discourse would be replaced by Commonwealth.</p>
<p>I think the MMM workstream should be in charge of deciding the viability since theyâ€™re developing the tools that would most benefit from this migration from Discourse to Commonwealth. An interesting thing that could be developed is say I hover over a stewardâ€™s profile pic in the Commonwealth forum, and Iâ€™m able to see a mini steward report card.</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>Are there any reason you think a migration would benefit the MMM-Workstream specifically and not any of the other Workstreams?</p>
<p>Can you describe a specific example of how MMM (or other workstreams) would directly benefit from moving from Discourse to this platform? You mention the Steward Report Cards, how would these be improved?</p>
<p>For clarity: The MMM-Workstream is using <a href="https://m-m-m.xyz/">Notion</a> and Discord to coordinate. Discourse is used by the MMM-Workstream to post proposals and as a way to signal the release of GitcoinDAO-wide tools, like the Steward Report Cards.</p>
