November CSDO Digest
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/november-csdo-digest/12338
    Many of you may know about our Cross-Stream DAO Operations, or [CSDO](https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/CSDO-1ab473386f74461c80b9409d0d400f0e), powerhouse team. If you don‚Äôt, CSDO is a group of workstream & initiative leads that come together to cultivate coherence across the DAO.

With all the world-regenerating we‚Äôre doing it‚Äôs easy for things to get lost. In our monthly CSDO Digest we‚Äôll break down all the most important CSDO outcomes from every month, so let‚Äôs dive into November!

## DAO-Wide Updates

During November, we held a Stewards Council election! The Stewards Council is a group of nominated Stewards tasked with reviewing budget proposals, coordinating high-level decisions that impact the DAO as a whole, and ensuring a collective vision for Gitcoin. All the nominations were submitted by Workstream Leads, after which we did the first quadratic voting ever [on Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoingov.eth/proposal/0x5543373d5748b4145b3a8a2cf8ecbf105fcb14d9b136f49134cd51bb4b8f6c75)!. You can get more details about the process and results of the election from our [blog post](https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-announces-the-results-of-the-first-ever-quadratically-elected-steward-council). You can also check out the full proposal for the V2 of the Stewards Council [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-v2-of-the-steward-council/11639).

## Proposals

### Pods

Pods were ratified, and will become a new method of collaboration within the DAO! Pods are an experiment in cross-workstream collaboration. They are a meme to help us codify the best practices of cross-workstream collaboration and to help give this networked work 1) a home outside of the individual workstreams and 2) a consistent voice within the DAO.

You can get the full rundown of Pods and how they work on their [notion page](https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/Pods-957596edb1b94236a3d76c7eae10c17d).

You can read the full passed proposal [here](https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/Pods-b2f019d9c5fa4944a9782b02cd511585).

### Budgets

The S16 Budgets went live on Tally! This is the last step for workstreams in the current budgeting process. Here are the budgets for each workstream:

## Key Discussions & Thoughts

A decision was made to conduct salary evaluations and reporting across the DAO - Stewards have been expressing increasing amounts of concerns over the DAO‚Äôs financial stability in a worsening bear market, and a report demonstrating that our budgets align with the market and are consistent across workstreams will help during next budgeting season. DAO Ops‚Äô Saf will be reaching out to workstreams for salary data, and comparing to data on OpenComp.

PGF‚Äôs Janine highlighted PGF's efforts in getting community input on the strategy of the Grants Program in the community-driven Protocol future. There is a tradeoff between ensuring as many voices as possible are heard, and creating factions within the community with competing interests, so how we approach these conversations is highly strategic.You can relisten to the DAO Vibes session [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy4OUh2jiMQ).

MMM‚Äôs CoachJ is driving the development of a ‚ÄúSingle Source of Truth‚Äù resource for contributors so that everyone has the information they need to do their jobs. Better information sharing at MMM has been game-changing to their team, and applying those learnings across the DAO are very welcomed.

While there were initial concerns from the PGF team about a potential partnership, PGF‚Äôs Ben West' thinking here is that the mentioned company will spend this money anyways - so why not make it a democratic and community-driven process? PGF will be developing a statement on this partnership to share with the community and a strategy doc outlining how/why we choose to pursue partnerships with certain orgs and not others. The $500k has been committed for the year, but the round won‚Äôt be run until we are more comfortable with potential impacts on brand/community.

Work continues on the DAO Operating System, an initiative that impacts all workstreams in the DAO. You can check out this [miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPDpwv9o=/) to see what we‚Äôre doing to ensure operational efficiency at every level of the organization.

FDD‚Äôs Joe shared the workstreams thoughts and insights surrounding economic risk balancing. They highlighted what we currently do vs what we could be doing. You can see their thoughts on this [miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPI9Cv44=/).

PGF‚Äôs Janine is continuing work on a pre-eth Denver retreat for external Gitcoin supporters. We‚Äôll be hosting an IRL retreat before the Schelling Point Conference and EthDenver for core community members who have supported Gitcoin historically, been champions of public goods for the good of our broader community, and leaders who want to commit to funding and fostering projects in their community with positive sum games with a priority around protocol partners. With the newly-found cheaper location, ticket sales, and just a few sponsors, we should be able to cover the full cost of the event.

Note: This event is not intended for contributors, and instead is focused on external Gitcoin supporters. We are working on doing something separate for Gitcoin contributors.

For more information on how these discussions went, you can check out all of the [CSDO Meeting Notes](https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/ae55433c4f834a249b6936f6f9aa8d18?v=1a740581545c4946970ba8985b0c225a) to read more, or the [Gitcoin Transparency YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdGQKwXzBAceH-ewgFy9nRPbjAk_Rj5n7) to watch recordings of CSDO calls!

And that‚Äôs it for this month! Keep checking back monthly for future editions of the CSDO Digest!

<p>So let me try again.</p>
<p><strong>Trying to convert any critics into insiders is a fundamentally flawed way of operating a DAO</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/jo1ZuhuCVZE?t=2208" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">There is a great Bankless podcast on this that just live-streamed yesterday.  Here is a timestamped video explaining why</a>.   And here is a screenshot of that timestamped spot.</p>

<p>Let me again restate my core point: <strong>Trying to convert any critics into insiders is a fundamentally flawed way of operating a DAO.</strong></p>
<p>I will now expand this into it‚Äôs reasoning: <strong>The more Gitcoin insiders 1. have ‚ÄúMaterial Non Public Information‚Äù and the more 2. Gitcoin insiders are making decisions with their agency on behalf of GTC holders, the more the risks accrue to the project.</strong></p>
<p>Now that we‚Äôve revisited this first principle, lets revisit my core objection above.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Do you see now why it is deeply problematic that Gitcoin insiders are fixing their own salary analysis to justify it in budgeting season without consulting GTC holders about the parameters of this analysis?   This is a centralization risk and you are creating misalignment between GTC holders (who have little context but have a vested interest in seeing the DAO perform) and insiders (who make contextual decisions on behalf of the DAO and want higher compensation from the DAO).</p>

<p>We know from this thread that Giveth spends roughly 10x less monthly than Gitcoin, so it‚Äôs 10x less vulnerable to running out of runway due to a downturn.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs also much newer than Gitcoin, and hasn‚Äôt had the benefit of being blessed by Vitalik with blog posts on vitalik.ca.</p>
<p>(To add insult to injury, Giveth seems to be shipping protocols much faster than Gitcoin on way less budget.)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Right. I get all those arguments, but I don‚Äôt understand when you connect it to the token price because the opposite of the desired effect is happening. The market seems to think that all the shipping and lower production costs of Giveth aren‚Äôt worth it. I‚Äôd like to understand how you decide that our model for payment is wrong. (I agree that it is not optimal.)</p>
<p>Perhaps you are saying that the head start and early Vitalik endorsements are entirely responsible for Gitcoin having lost an order of magnitude less value on the market than Giveth?</p>
<p>I tend to think the macro-environment is driving all of it, but relative changes do matter. BTW. Per your last paragraph, this IS NOT JUSTIFICATION. It is attempting to understand logic with an inherent paradox.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To me, none of these are very good as essential intent because they are not clear and achievable. They are too high-level. Here are my suggestions for how we can use these intents to clearly move Gitcoin toward sustainability.</p>
<p>I would slightly change the buckets</p>
<h2>Bucket 1 - Launch and grow the components of a successful Grants 2 flagship protocol</h2>
<p>A successful grants 2.0 protocol is each of the components having been launched with well documented SDKs and clear growth metrics. The components include the fixed and modular components.</p>
<p>Fixed components include the grants registry, the identity registry, and the round manager (pool registry). The round manager is where communities can choose their own ‚Äúfunding stack‚Äù of modular components.</p>
<p>Standards, protocols, modular design, and composability all benefit evolutionary systems because it limits the design space so new builders can experiment where the most impact is available. A funding stack includes the user and grant moderation (regulation), the funding mechanism, and the discoverability of grants on the Gitcoin UI (only because it will be the only one at launch). These spaces are what will create the most innovative solutions.</p>
<p>Here are my essential intents for this objective.</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch the grants registry, user registry, and pool registry (3 binary goals)
<ul>
<li>If these are completed it means we hit our base goal of shipping a flagship product (Could clear up the wording to indicate actual usage, but I don‚Äôt think semantics are the issue here)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Identify and set growth targets for each to use during season 15 (ie. 10k Passport non-sybil passport holders, 5000 grants on registry, $50 million in pooled funds)
<ul>
<li>Clear growth goals to be assigned to workstreams for accountability</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Identify and set growth targets for 1 click funding stack permutations available (ie. 12 funding stack permutations)
<ul>
<li>The value proposition is that GTC will catalyze an increase in the accessible experimentation surface for any community to fund their shared needs. Growing this experimentation surface can be measured by permutations available on the Gitcoin UI for easy use by any community.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bucket 2 - Improve the sustainability of Gitcoin</h2>
<p>The sustainability of Gitcoin requires capital contributors to continue seeing the velocity of GTC lower and innovative solutions shipped. This means the communication from contributors to stewards who control funding decisions is delivered in an effective way and that the contributors efforts are substantial.</p>
<p>To do this Gitcoin must create a portfolio diversification thesis, a value capture thesis, and the roadmaps and tools to implement them. Diversification is simple actions and tools which can be handles by a delegated authority with oversight. Roadmaps and implementation are simply design and engineering.</p>
<p>Value capture is unexplained at this point. Here I will attempt to connect this to my long intro.</p>
<p>GTCs sole utility should be investing in workstreams, structured and unstructured, via Gitcoin governance. Gitcoin should use quadratic weighted staking to reward people for governance participation. The key is that the staked GTC would not only be eligible for voting to direct funding in GitcoinDAO, but it would also be used to participate in the governance of the components of the grants 2.0 protocol.</p>
<p>Each component of the funding stack could launch its own token for economic rights without governance (or with some portion) of the participation in governance.</p>
<p>For example, Gitcoin Passport would fuse with the sybil detection DAO concept and launch a token economy to incentivize the acceleration of network effects in its adoption. It could reward stamp providers used by reader apps based on how many uses the reader gets or by funds passed through it‚Äôs resistance algorithm. It could reward sybil hunters and data scientists in a model contest.</p>
<p>The grants and pool registries could do the same in their own way. Then Gitcoin could invest in the first solutions available for the composable components such as a decentralized grant review protocol or a revenue generating business consulting communities on using the protocol.</p>
<p>If this sounds familiar, it is the roadmap of ethereum ecosystem expansion. Gitcoin currently has a huge information asymmetry we can collectively take advantage of to bring sustainability.</p>
<p>We are building a city and have first dibs on ownership of the public utilities (decentralized grants eligibility reviews) and private businesses (UI generation and round consultation as a service). The best part is the monopolies are ethical because they are openly accessible through Gitcoin. Maybe we monopolize most solutions and SALSA tax their value into future rounds‚Ä¶</p>
<p>That said, here are my other essential intents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have &gt; 2 years of runway in stablecoins &amp; runway time is INCREASING
<ul>
<li>An R(n) growth rate over 1 means sustainability</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Investments in Gitcoin built or used businesses &amp; protocols &gt; Gitcoin investments in non-gitcoin built or used businesses &amp; protocols
<ul>
<li>Means we invest at least $100k in our own dogfooded solutions (ie workstreams become value capture factories)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improve steward satisfaction score from x to y
<ul>
<li>Implication of needed communication &amp; process fixes around this role</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improve contributor satisfaction score from a to b
<ul>
<li>Implication of needed improvements self scored by those in the role</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>In conclusion</h1>
<p>My intention here is to share my personal perspective and influence others‚Äô thinking. I don‚Äôt intend to prescribe what is correct or incorrect, but rather to share the perspective I hold.</p>
<p>I am HIGHLY aligned with the essential intents already proposed and would vote to ratify them to the DAO today.</p>

</aside>
<p>We know from this thread that Giveth spends roughly 10x less monthly than Gitcoin, so it‚Äôs 10x less vulnerable to running out of runway due to a downturn.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs also much newer than Gitcoin, and hasn‚Äôt had the benefit of being blessed by Vitalik with blog posts on vitalik.ca.</p>
<p>(To add insult to injury, Giveth seems to be shipping protocols much faster than Gitcoin on way less budget.)</p>

<p>Giveth spends around $120k a month with 40+ paid contributors, ~50% being full time, and GTC is spending 10x that, but it is not an org 10x the size. We are very inefficient with our resources IMO, and can do more with less, but there is no motivation to move that direction, because it is hard!</p>

</aside>
<p>I‚Äôve attended DAO vibes as a lurker, but not stewards calls. How do I get into those?</p>
<p>It‚Äôs pretty clear to me Gitcoin is bloated, wasteful, and ineffective.  It‚Äôs spending $1million/month and not meeting it‚Äôs own stated essential intents, and the market downtrend is clear.  When confronted with this feedback, there is <strong>SO MUCH JUSTIFYING OF THE STATUS QUO</strong> that comes from insiders,  I don‚Äôt think my attending these calls will (and making me an insider too) will change any of my opinions.  It‚Äôs much more scalable for insiders to start responding to the market than to convert all of the market to insiders.</p>
<p>I want so badly to be bullish on GTC, but what I see on the governance forums is not promising.</p>

</aside>
<p>It sounds like your answer here is YES, you do think that the analysis was done in a backwards way to justify the current pay rates. (For clarification, I was not involved in this and was not countering your argument, only seeking to make sure I/others understand.)</p>
<p>I do agree that something like connecting pay to GTC price would be a potentially useful consideration. Maybe something like half the pay in USDC and half paid in GTC at whatever price it is so salaries adjust with the value of GTC? Is that the type of solution you might be suggesting?</p>

</aside>
<p>Part of what you are experiencing is caused by how much time and effort went into operating grants rounds GR15 and prior. This season the DAO is focused on launching the protocol. This is largely why we voted to scrap the old cGrants platform and fully move to the protocol even over having a GR16 round in December. It gave us time to deep dive in workshopping and understanding these deeper problems which we are acutely aware of, but have not been able to prioritize.</p>
<p>We have been able to use the extra time to meaningfully work on these issues. Personally, I respect both the ability of the community to help with the brainstorming process AND the need to have people closest to the problem be the ones working on it. Until we share where we are at with our business planning for 2023, it will be difficult for you to judge how well the time has been spent. However, I don‚Äôt see any problems with us working out ideas between people close to them, then sharing with broader and broader segments of the community.</p>
<p>We absolutely do know the urgency of the problem of this downward spiral. The number one problem to solve is launching the protocol. Number 2 is how do we ensure it‚Äôs continued success.</p>

<p>Here is Uniswap. Our weekly average high was around $14 (not a daily high that was a parabolic liquidity spike squeeze with a little fomo reflexivity on top). This shows me that an established project like uniswap at a 6-8:1 devaluation so forth. We are closer to a 10:1.</p>
<p>Polygon is the best I could find sitting at about a 2-3:1</p>

<p>My point here being. What do we define as success?</p>
<p>If we are talking about a team maintaining market value, how does one suggest that the pay structure of the Giveth team is desirable when they have suffered a 60-90:1 devaluation?</p>
<p>While I agree with your point about the analysis being done in a way that could have been better. It seems like there are 2 issues you are discussing here.</p>
<ol>
<li>The argument with the incorrect articulation of the analysis and it‚Äôs purpose. For this, I feel there isn‚Äôt a need to push it further because it specifically was the straw man incorrect articulation that is being argued. This does bring us to the real issue which is point 2‚Ä¶</li>
<li>How might we justify the 2023 business plan for Gitcoin as whole. Including pay rates, budget processes, and revenue/growth forecasting, etc.? For this, lets continue the conversation in the thread linked <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-bull-bear-case-for-gitcoin-gtc-in-2023/12442/2">here</a>.</li>

<p>As a GTC holder, I believe GitcoinDAO should stop fucking up its enormous lead from years ago when Vitalik blessed it and deliver a protocol that distributes value at scale.   The protocol should accrue value at a scale that justifies it‚Äôs $130 million market cap (which used to be over $ 1 billion, and is declining week by week).  And contributors to Gitcoin can be rewarded with generous pay when you do so (but not beforehand).</p>
<p>The recent protocol alpha rounds are a good start.  But they‚Äôre just a start.</p>

<p>A charade of a market analysis to justify the current cost structure with a preordained outcome only harms Gitcoin.</p>

</aside>
<p>The market analysis intends to show that our resource allocation, which consists &gt;90% of contributor compensation, is responsible and in-line with the labour market. What it <strong>doesn‚Äôt</strong> show is that the resources being deployed are in fact necessary and the most efficient way to achieve our shared goals.<br>
This is currently done through our quarterly budgeting process, where workstreams demonstrate how resources were used in the previous season, and how they will be deployed in the next. We acknowledge that the existing budgeting process doesn‚Äôt make it very simple for Stewards to engage with the direction-setting process, and as such we hope to also have a redesigned budgeting process for next season‚Äôs funding requests.</p>

<p>Does OpenComp have a large dataset of public goods DAO compensation data on it? If not, which comparables will you be using for the analysis? Will you be comparing compensation data to massively profitable for-profit orgs, or to non-profits?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The dataset of ‚ÄúPublic Goods DAOs‚Äù isn‚Äôt large enough to be a legitimate benchmark, however OpenComp uses data from thousands of data sources (employers) in a variety of industries. We are <strong>not</strong> benchmarking to FAANG/high CoL area tech-company salaries, but we also don‚Äôt think non-profits‚Äô notoriously exploitative pay models are something we should aspire to match.</p>
<p>We hire highly talented contributors who are value-aligned and often giving up higher-paying (and often more stable/predictable) opportunities in other industries to work at Gitcoin. We believe they should all be compensated fairly, and benchmarking comp to a large, nation-wide (US because this is where a large majority of our team is based) database is the best way to ensure fairness while being responsible with our use of treasury.</p>

<p>Nothing that is clearly articulated and agreed as a likely path at this time, but we have had many conversations about the future direction and financial sustainability of Gitcoin. We are primarily focused now on launching the Grants Protocol successfully. As this happens over the next few months, we will begin really diving into the hard choices and changes that will need to be made to best support the ongoing success of Gitcoin. The conversations are happening now, but it is a very risky move to make major changes before the protocol is successfully launched.</p>

<p>Wait - Let me get this straight ‚Äì You all decided to commission a report to show that your budgets align with the market, before even analyzing the data that would show if that is true or not? How is that possibly legitimate? Why not start with a market analysis and then decide the conclusion based upon that information?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This was phrased poorly in the write up. The review consists of two parts.</p>
<p>Part 1 - Have the workstreams spent the funds they received as planned and have clear accounting of how it was spent?</p>
<p>Part 2 - Have the workstreams gone through the compensation leveling review that Saf has done with a few workstreams already. Yes, this uses open comp.</p>
<p>I do not know of any analysis looking at whether our salary levels are in line with other non-profit grants giving DAOs. I have a hunch that there are only a few and we are aware of them, therefore making an analysis of the market in this way somewhat unnecessary.</p>
<p>I doubt your intention is to argue about a few hundred dollars or even a few thousand for a contributor to audit workstreams in this fashion.</p>
<p>I am hearing that you are concerned that Gitcoin is paying contributors more than is necessary. Additionally, I‚Äôm hearing frustration at thinking that this report was a backwards analysis generated to validate our current pay rates. <strong>Is this correct?</strong></p>
<p>If I have accurately articulated your concerns, then your concerns are totally valid, but likely unrelated to the analysis/report reference here.</p>

<a name="key-discussions-thoughts-5" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#key-discussions-thoughts-5"></a>Key Discussions &amp; Thoughts</h2>
<p>A decision was made to conduct salary evaluations and reporting across the DAO - Stewards have been expressing increasing amounts of concerns over the DAO‚Äôs financial stability in a worsening bear market, and a report demonstrating that our budgets align with the market and are consistent across workstreams will help during next budgeting season. DAO Ops‚Äô Saf will be reaching out to workstreams for salary data, and comparing to data on OpenComp.</p>
<p>PGF‚Äôs Janine highlighted PGF‚Äôs efforts in getting community input on the strategy of the Grants Program in the community-driven Protocol future. There is a tradeoff between ensuring as many voices as possible are heard, and creating factions within the community with competing interests, so how we approach these conversations is highly strategic.You can relisten to the DAO Vibes session <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy4OUh2jiMQ" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a>.</p>
<p>MMM‚Äôs CoachJ is driving the development of a ‚ÄúSingle Source of Truth‚Äù resource for contributors so that everyone has the information they need to do their jobs. Better information sharing at MMM has been game-changing to their team, and applying those learnings across the DAO are very welcomed.</p>
<p>While there were initial concerns from the PGF team about a potential partnership, PGF‚Äôs Ben West‚Äô thinking here is that the mentioned company will spend this money anyways - so why not make it a democratic and community-driven process? PGF will be developing a statement on this partnership to share with the community and a strategy doc outlining how/why we choose to pursue partnerships with certain orgs and not others. The $500k has been committed for the year, but the round won‚Äôt be run until we are more comfortable with potential impacts on brand/community.</p>
<p>Work continues on the DAO Operating System, an initiative that impacts all workstreams in the DAO. You can check out this <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPDpwv9o=/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">miro board</a> to see what we‚Äôre doing to ensure operational efficiency at every level of the organization.</p>
<p>FDD‚Äôs Joe shared the workstreams thoughts and insights surrounding economic risk balancing. They highlighted what we currently do vs what we could be doing. You can see their thoughts on this <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPI9Cv44=/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">miro board</a>.</p>
<p>PGF‚Äôs Janine is continuing work on a pre-eth Denver retreat for external Gitcoin supporters. We‚Äôll be hosting an IRL retreat before the Schelling Point Conference and EthDenver for core community members who have supported Gitcoin historically, been champions of public goods for the good of our broader community, and leaders who want to commit to funding and fostering projects in their community with positive sum games with a priority around protocol partners. With the newly-found cheaper location, ticket sales, and just a few sponsors, we should be able to cover the full cost of the event.</p>
<p>Note: This event is not intended for contributors, and instead is focused on external Gitcoin supporters. We are working on doing something separate for Gitcoin contributors.</p>
