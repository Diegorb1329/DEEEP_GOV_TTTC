[Proposal - Akita] Proposal to Gitcoin community from AKITA
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-akita-proposal-to-gitcoin-community-from-akita/218
    This is the AKITA communities proposal to the recent decision by Vitalik Buterin to send half of their supply to Gitcoin. 

**1. Summary** -  Our proposal is to burn everything that VB sent except for 5%. Leave 5% to stimulate progress between both communities. The reason for 5% is because, prior to the original developer leaving the project they burned 5% of the supply. This gives the token supply a 5% window that can be extracted before starting to mess with the original token metrics of the project. I propose giving 3% to Gitcoin to fund public goods, a finders fee so to speak. Along with giving 2% to the AKITA network team to act as funding for the future of the project. We have been completely self funded thus far, and with funding could make Gitcoin's portion worth a lot more.

**2. Abstract** -  Implementation would be relatively easy, send the tokens that need to be burned to a burn wallet, leave Gitcoin's tokens in the multisig, send the AKITA teams tokens to our multisig. 


**3. Motivation** - The motivation behind this proposal is to mitigate collateral damage. The Akita investors invested believing that half of our supply was "burned" to VBs wallet. We did not intentionally send these tokens to VB ourselves, and as such should not be punished for doing so. However our ignorance does not mean we are *not* subject to consequence. Gitcoin is an excellent source of funding for much needed public goods. By taking this route we can use the opportunity to educate new Ethereum users on the importance of public goods funding while staying within a range that causes as little harm as possible to the community. By holding $AKITA, Gitcoin now has a vested interest in the AKITA network project, and the AKITA network project has a vested interest in Gitcoin. By taking this peaceful approach Gitcoin will avoid any unnecessary backlash, and secure a long term source of funding, pending the AKITA communities success. The AKITA community reached a 1B valuation prior to these events. There is no reason to believe that long term success of this cooperation would not be obtainable for both parties.

**4. Specification** - I believe that as soon as Gitcoin announces this burn and cooperation that an immediate price action will take effect, the same that happened to SHIBA (+44%) after their burn announcement. Yet, the most important thing that will happen is that it will allow our community to rest on their speculation and move forward with more important topics. For Gitcoin, the implications are that there is now expectation from the Gitcoin community toward the AKITA community. Holding 3% of our supply is roughly equivalent to what some of the big exchanges hold. We would be honored as a community if Gitcoin found the most efficient way of using this capital.

**5. Benefits** - The benefits of this proposal are many, #1 The AKITA community is able to get back to our original tokenomics. #2 The Gitcoin community is able to secure a source of long term funding. #3 The Gitcoin community is able to introduce themselves to a community of new and eager Ethereum users. #4 The AKITA community is able to be introduced to some of the greatest minds on Ethereum and what they are trying to build. #5 This social experiment plays out in a natural way that benefits both parties tremendously. #6 No unnecessary backlash for either party.

**6. Drawbacks** -  Drawbacks could include radical entities from either side not being satisfied with the decision and intentionally voicing this publicly. 

**7.  Vote**- Clearly outline what voting ‚Äúyes‚Äù and ‚Äúno‚Äù entails.
**Voting Yes means that you are voting to agree with my proposal. **
**A Yes vote means to agree with Gitcoin burning 45% of the tokens sent from Vitalik's wallet and splitting the remaining 5% with AKITA network's team, with 3% going to Gitcoin and 2% going to the AKITA dev team.**
**Voting No means that you are voting against this proposal in favor of another proposal.**

            <p>Wow, look, what a self righteous hypocrite.</p>
<p>Where was your empathy when your scam coin decided to send its ponzi tokens to Vitalik‚Äôs wallet, thus using Vitalik to pump and dump your scam as if he was involved in it?</p>
<p>‚ÄúGitcoin will fall just as rapidly‚Äù - Lmao dood, Gitcoin is a fund raising platform that has already done 10000x more for the betterment of this world than your scammy ponzi coin.</p>
<p>Just accept AKITA for what it is - a ponzi scam without any substantial use case, and all you clown world shills in here as ponzi scammers pumping this worthless project devoid of any actual value</p>
<p>It‚Äôs actually embarrassing seeing crap like AKITA shills on gitcoin posting rocket emojis on a forum for actual crypto discussion and fundraising projects that actually improve the world.</p>

            <p>AKITA is a ponzi scam, and all you pumpers and dumpers are gonna lose all of it. If you have 2 functional brain cells, you will sell all you hold of these ponzi schemes tokens and get out while it has any value at all.</p>

            <p>To all the Akitans , if you actually want AKITA to increase in value and believe it to not just be a meme, burning your supply is probably the least effective mechanism you could be advocating for.  A vote for burn is effectively saying there is no inherent value.</p>

            <p>Hi Team,</p>
<p>I am one of the guys working with the ghouls of based.loans, a DE-FI lending fork of Compound Finance (the largest lending protocol)</p>
<p>I have a more Degen idea than just burning tokens to raise value of $AKITA. Why not put all the $AKITA to work on Based Loans? It‚Äôs a Compound Finance fork, which was designed to target the Alt coin space for coins with high trading volume, high liquidity, and high number of holders.</p>
<p>We decided to create markets for the highest traded dog coins on ETH main chain.</p>
<p>Essentially the play is to Deposit $AKITA to based.loans to earn $BLO APY on $KISHU.</p>
<p>This will reduce selling pressure and increase the price over time.</p>
<p>P.S. The screenshot if from one of my personal wallets.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>The Spaniard</p>

<li>Should it be streamed? (See <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-akita-fund-public-goods-with-akita-via-quadratic-funding/185">my proposal</a> that includes streaming over 10 years.)</li>

[Proposal - Akita] Proposal to Gitcoin community from AKITA
Vee

            <p>I believe without AKITA tokens donations to Gitcoin, Gitcoin funding will continue normally. As such, Gitcoin shouldn‚Äôt focus on extracting value out of AKITA right away (in fact, AKITA current value is greatly underperforming)</p>
<p>Between Relic proposal (I.e. burning 95% as original intended  and holding 5%) and Vitalik proposal (selling maybe 10% and locking 90% for a long term), I believe implementing  Relic proposal will stir public positive sentiment towards Akita which will in turn increase its value.</p>
<p>Positive sentiments rules the crypto space‚Ä¶ The effect of  FUD cannot be overemphasised!!!</p>
<p>AKITA perform greatly without listing on major exchanges and having some advancement projects underway.</p>
<p>I tend to believe that with listings of AKITA on major platforms, completion and deployment of AKITA‚Äôs advancements alongside an announcement and implementation of burning AKITA token (the 95%) will be immensely beneficial to both communities.</p>
<p>Choosing, Announcing and taking action to actual sell some % of AKITA tokens by Gitcoin will further plummet the already plummeted  value of AKITA at the very least while it can eventually lead to the death of the social experiment envisaged by AKITA current developers and holders.</p>
<p>Also, I also believe the sales of AKITA tokens shouldn‚Äôt be announced to avoid AKITA price crash and to maximise the recovery of stable funds from its sales.</p>
