    Hello everyone,

I've been hard at work with @bobjiang and a handful of really amazing contributors to translate GreenPill to other languages.  Translating the book to other languages will allow the message of how crypto could be good for the world to be spread beyond just native english speakers.

Here are the finished translations:

You can get the digital copies of the translations [here](https://store.gitcoin.co/collections/greenpill-books),

You can get physical copies of the books here:

            <p>It is definitely readable for native speakers as Google Neural Machine Translation system (GNMT) is doing its job pretty well.<br>
But I believe this book deserves better than the automatic translation. How do you think we should proceed?</p>

So from your point of view, how is the quality for the translation?</p>
<p>Is it readable for Turkish native speakers?</p>

            <p>Hi there, a friend of mine pointed me to this book and the translation efforts. I¬¥d be happy to help translating it into German. How would be the procedure? Also I¬¥m new on gitcoin and could need some short advice where and how to start.<br>
Best regards, Eric</p>

            <p>I‚Äôve done 23 for now.<br>
As a regenerative hemp farmer and someone in ReFi space trying to green pill my environment; that quality (%100 google translate) should not be accepted IMHO.<br>
It‚Äôs been 13 days since I wrote, -there is so much going around those couple of weeks- but I will surely finish this asap. (maybe with some help from friends)</p>
<p>((It has also been forgotten to google translate on ‚ÄúNash Equilibra‚Äù part; it was in English; So as coordination games suggest; google translating everything might not be punished maybe but definitely shouldn‚Äôt be rewarded if it‚Äôs done without notice.))</p>
<p>I‚Äôm only new here on forums, but I know we have the brightest minds in the universe as developers here on Gitcoin; isn‚Äôt there a program/system to check if translations have been done with -only- google translate?</p>
<p>Best,</p>

            <p>Hello and thx for all the effort &lt;3</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been in the translation group for Turkish but the group couldn‚Äôt proceed fast (it was our planting season), but it was translated, and made me very happy at first!<br>
Unfortunately after reading it, I‚Äôm not happy with how it ended up. I‚Äôve checked all sentences and sadly this is %100 google translate where some sentences don‚Äôt have a meaning.  (+Nash equilibria part is not translated at all)</p>
<p>Thanks to GitcoinGR13, our project was able to sow seeds in 5 different regions with many other benefits.  Personally, I am not looking for any bounty, but feel responsible for giving back to the community by correcting the poor translation of the book with our team before the distribution to reach Turkish readers.<br>
The subject is not easy for all, and I‚Äôd suggest it could be better to reach readers with correct sentences rather than google translate. (Better late than poor translation?)</p>
<p>Waiting on your opinions.<br>
Thank you</p>
