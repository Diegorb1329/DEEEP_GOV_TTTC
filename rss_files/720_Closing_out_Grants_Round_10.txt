            <p>It doesn‚Äôt matter where they were posted for this round. We were looking at all Twitter, Discord, and the Notion page. We will develop a process that is better at alerting stewards and offering a standard central place for comments.</p>

<p>Hey Joe,</p>
<p>a Small ask from me would be to also cross-post stuff in the stewards channel which I think you do already just to remind us to act.</p>
<p>So here for disputes they should be discussed in Twitter and go through all Twitter posts of the dispute account?</p>
