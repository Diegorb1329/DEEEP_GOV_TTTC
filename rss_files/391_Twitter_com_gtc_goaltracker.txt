    Hi everyone,

I just wanted to show off a twitter bot built by myself and @umarkhaneth called [@gtc_goaltracker](https://twitter.com/gtc_goaltracker).

This goal tracker tracks the growth of Allo protocol towards its 2024 goal of $15m ([set by Grants Lab](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/grants-lab-s21-budget-proposal/17636)).

It posts everyday with the latest progress.

If you want to see a breakdown of which rounds are driving the most GMV (Gross Marketplace Value), check out the link in the twitter bio https://app.regendata.xyz/public/question/9c60e24f-9146-4335-a490-f5e14357e991 .

Here's what this looks like:

I hope this resource is useful for you.  I believe that if you can measure it, you can manage it.  So hopefully this resource is useful for others to rally around.  Excited to celebrate Gitcoin's progress in the future.
