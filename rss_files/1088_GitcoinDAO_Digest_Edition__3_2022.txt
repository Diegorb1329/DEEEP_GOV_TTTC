### üëâ Key actions for this week:

1. Vote on the [Gitcoin DAO - Workstream Accountability Flow Ratification](https://www.withtally.com/governance/eip155:1:0xDbD27635A534A3d3169Ef0498beB56Fb9c937489/proposal/15)
2. Make sure to [claim](https://discord.com/channels/562828676480237578/890336705998127165/933827677041860628) your GitcoinDAO Contributor 2021 POAP!

## [ü§ñ Meta-Governance](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/governance-meta/6)

* [Elliot](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/Elliott) from Llama [posted an update](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-financial-reporting/8867/3) to the [Gitcoin Financial Reporting](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Qgfrh4F1Q-mbsoLaEHGY8eLXJl75Sp_/view) for December 2021. The statements are split into transactions denoted in GTC and in stablecoins.

* [GD Steward Roles & Responsibilities](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gd-steward-roles-responsibilities/9762) by [Simona](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/Pop) starts a conversation on the roles and responsibilities of our Stewards in GitcoinDAO. ‚ÄúStewards are in charge of listening to their constituents, evaluating and voting on proposals. (...) They are the protectors of the legitimacy of the DAO, they are responsible for keeping the DAO on track to accomplish its mission, and they are final enforcers of responsibility for everyone working on the GitcoinDAO‚Äôs mission".

* We‚Äôve seen a lot of great feedback for the foreword of his upcoming [Regen CryptoEconomics book](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/regen-cryptoeconomics-book-foreword-by-gitcoindao/9711/) by [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary). Check out some of the suggestions from [Diego](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/clasikman/summary), [Kyle](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle), and [Scott](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation) on how GitcoinDAO should be represented!

* [IRLart](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/irlart) is [asking for feedback](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/calling-all-gitcoindao-metaverse-coordinators/8902/13) on the beneficiary of the Gitcoin / Solar Punk Auction that will be hosted at ETHDenver. ‚ÄúIt could go directly to the Gitcoin DAO multisig, but I thought it would be a great gesture of regenerative crypto economics to streamline it to the metaverse coordinators working group to continue elevating their efforts.‚Äù

## [üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Workstream Discussion](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/workstream-discussion/9)

### üå± [Public Goods Funding](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Public-Goods-4ccd579f433c4dff9d8952314468d6e8)

* [Annika](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/annika) and the Public Goods workstream are [seeking community input](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-community-input-on-gr13-structure/9735) on how we can improve the structure for the upcoming GR13 taking place from March 9-14 this year. ‚ÄúAs we continue on the path of decentralizing Grants Ops from Holdings into the DAO, we want to build the habit of bringing the community in much earlier in the process to provide their input on what they want to see with respect to the matching pool, rather than having a Holdings-proposed structure that stewards simply vote on.‚Äù

### [üöÄ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-prototyping-workstream-moonshot-budget-request-q4-2021/8785) [Moonshot Collective](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Moonshot-Collective-ffa78f44a0de412cb607f9b69d3a376f)

* Heading out to [ETHDenver](https://www.ethdenver.com/) in February? Our Moonshot Collective devs will be speaking at various points throughout the conference, and we‚Äôll be hosting Schelling Point on Feb 17 where we‚Äôll debut ‚Äú[Greenpilled](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/regen-cryptoeconomics-book-governance/9713)‚Äù, Owocki‚Äôs Regen CryptoEconomics book. Stay tuned for more details.

* Every week Moonshot Collective devs try out the apps they‚Äôve been working on. We call it dogfooding, and our dogfood tastes good! Check out the project videos [on our YouTube here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVupIN3GgLthT8vSZjY9U6nHrtDigmf2w).

### üåê [Decentralize Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Decentralize-Gitcoin-cd6d46d3784244e4ae7a68b108bb9495)

* We‚Äôve [published the data](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/dgrants-gr12-round-payout-data-verification/9752) used to execute payouts on the governance forum as a final step in completing the payouts for the Gitcoin Building Gitcoin round that was run in GR12. Community members can now run through the verification process themselves! Currently, this process is lightly documented and requires strong technical expertise, but we are working on making this more user-friendly in the future.

* Research on the various areas that will feed into the final design of the dGrants V1 Protocol is moving forward. The areas mentioned in [our last update](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoindao-digest-edition-2-2022/9739) currently consist of Smart Contract Upgradability, Grant Creation Flow, Curation Approaches, and Grant Metadata Management. We are taking the learnings from the last two rounds as well as customer/user use cases to improve and designing a robust protocol accordingly.

* It is clear that a multi-chain implementation of dGrants is a must, so we are working hard to ensure that we can take the V1 solution and deploy it across any EVM compatible network. This will allow us to build a single cohesive ecosystem on top of each of these Grant Registry deployments.

* The DevOps team has created a request portal for the GitcoinDAO, making submitting requests significantly easier and more trackable.

* Next week, we will be proposing rolling out DAO wide standards around required 2FA and the use of password managers.

### üíô [Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Fraud-Detection-Defense-2bde13c0b8e74fda81435d94e49e2703)

* FDD will host a meeting with their multisig oversight group on Friday to review Q4 deliverables and Q1 budget proposal.

### üé® [Merch, Memes & Marketing](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Merch-Memes-and-Marketing-60cc693f0fe14be1879a05587922c8a3)

* We‚Äôve listed 4 bounties ([1](https://gitcoin.co/issue/mmmgtc/bounties/1/100027489), [2](https://gitcoin.co/issue/mmmgtc/bounties/2/100027492), [3](https://gitcoin.co/issue/mmmgtc/bounties/3/100027521), [4](https://gitcoin.co/issue/mmmgtc/bounties/4/100027528)) in the [Gitcoin Schelling Point hackathon](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/schellingpoint/onboard) leading up to ETHDenver! The bounties are worth over 3000 DAI in total, so make sure to check them out!

* We‚Äôve sent across the Regen vs Degen card game to the production company. Over a hundred decks have been ordered in the first batch that will be given out to attendees of Schelling Point in February. Make sure to keep an eye out for hidden easter eggs!

* Check out the MMM Workstream objectives and key results for Q1 that was recently [posted on the forum](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/2022-roadmap-2022-goals/9613/13) by [Sean](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/seanmac). Our budget request is being worked on and more details on this will be shared soon.

* Make sure to [claim](https://discord.com/channels/562828676480237578/890336705998127165/933827677041860628) your very own GitcoinDAO Contributor 2021 POAP if you contributed to any of the Workstreams last year!

## üìÖ [Upcoming community events](https://www.addevent.com/calendar/pz351122)
