https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-passport-season-20-21-budget-request/16765
    # [Proposal] Passport Season 20 & 21 Budget Request

This seeks funding for the Gitcoin Passport workstream for Seasons 20 and 21 (Nov 1, 2023 - Apr 30, 2024). The proposal has been reviewed and coordinated with CSDO and key Stewards, namely, @kyle @meglister @Viriya @vinayvasanji. We still want your feedback and find it crucial to optimize our roadmap.

## TL;DR

Gitcoin Passport aims to be the go-to solution for web3 identity management. In Seasons 20 and 21, we‚Äôll concentrate on five key pillars:

1. Effectiveness: Improve identity scoring models
2. Adoption: Grow to 1.5M passports
3. GTC Utility: Strengthen GTC-based identity and community ties
4. Data: Enhance and aggregate Sybil detection and data sets
5. Partnerships: Increase both API and onchain partnerships

## Outline

Gitcoin Passport is the premier solution for easy-to-use identity management tools that protect communities from Sybils and bots. Our easy-to-use app makes it possible for web3 citizens to establish credibility and build online reputation while preserving privacy and user control and our API lets web3 communities access a powerful layer of security with just a few lines of code.

**Recent Achievements:** In Season 18 and 19, we identified early signs of product-market fit, marked by a 3x user growth and a 6x increase in GTC Staking. 

**Objectives for Seasons 20 and 21**: This table lists the milestones and deliverables we plan to tackle. While they are in a loose priority order, their final sequencing is still under evaluation.

|Initiative/Project|Outcome|Milestone/ deliverable|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Improve Effectiveness|Enhance the scoring model|Develop a scoring model with <10% Type I errors (False positives - Sybils are classified as human)|
|Grow Adoption & Usage|Expand user base|Increase Passport count to 1.5M from a baseline of ~700k-750k|
|GTC Utility|Strengthen GTC-based identity and community ties| <p>Double GTC staking to 2M GTC</p> Double the community stake addresses in the GTC social graph to 25k, up from a current baseline of 12.8k|
|Data|Improve Sybil detection  <p>Validate known humans</p> Create a 3rd labeled category|Identify > 1M Sybils <p>Catalog > 20,000 verified human users</p> Develop modeled insights to classify bots, suspicious activity, or reputational attributes|
|Partnerships|<p> Increase API integrations</P>  Onboard onchain partners| <p> Partner > 70 API users from a baseline of 30-35 </P> Engage > 5 onchain partners from a baseline of 0|

**Note:** The milestones are subject to change as we continue to assess the most effective order of implementation.

By focusing on these objectives, we aim to fortify Gitcoin Passport as the go-to solution for identity management in the web3 space.

## Milestone Update(s)

[Season 18 Update for S19 Budget Request](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s19-proposal-amended-passport-s19-budget-request/16184)

In Season 19, our growth was slower than expected, reaching 700k total passports which is 70% of our target of 1M. However, we exceeded expectations in GTC staking, hitting over 1M GTC against a target of 450k.

We‚Äôve also expanded our service offerings to include onchain Passports. The $2 mint fee saw good uptake, with almost 11k users moving their Passports onchain, even without partner-driven incentives.

### Milestone Report for Past Season

**Legend:**
:green_circle: Success/Completed/Shipped
:yellow_circle: Incomplete but will hit goal/priority changed
:red_circle: Incomplete, will not hit goal
:black_circle: Cancelled

|Initiative/Project||Key Results|Value Delivered|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Passport Holder Experience Improvements||:red_circle: 699,000 Passports|Reached 70% of target, yet proved scalability. Business Development is now crucial for adoption.|
|GTC Staking Improvements||:green_circle: 1,034,000 GTC Staked|Surpassed the goal by a large margin. Demonstrated that identity staking enhances GTC utility.|
|Revenue Experiments||:green_circle: 12.5 ETH /~$20k USD|Initial revenue achieved through mint fees, validating our revenue model.|
|Onchain Scoring||:green_circle: Launched on OP |Over 11k Passports moved onchain. $2 mint fee well-received.|
|Research Custom Community Experience||:green_circle: New endpoints & parameters|Enhanced adaptability for integration partners, based on their feedback|

**Observations:**

* While we fell short on passport adoption, we found success in GTC staking, revealing a clear path for utility.
* Revenue streams are starting to show promise.
* Despite lacking full utility, onchain Passports gained surprising traction.

By revisiting our milestones and assessing both successes and shortcomings, we're armed with invaluable insights for strategizing in the upcoming seasons. For more granular details on our past work and future plans, please refer to our previous budgets for [S17](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s17-proposal-integrated-gitcoin-passport-budget-request/12727) and [S18 & S19 budget request,](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gitcoin-passport-workstream-season-18-19-budget-request/14121) as well as the [S19 Amended Budget Request](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s19-proposal-amended-passport-s19-budget-request/16184) and [Passport Roadmap](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15745RJWTkpurLIOOEuIeZp3Y249HBhGs4fIuj2LjQ8Q/edit#gid=0).

Feel free to ask for further clarifications or discuss any points in greater detail. Thank you.

## Budget Update for Season S20

Our financial strategy aims for stability; hence, we are maintaining a nearly flat budget for S20 compared to the revised S19 plan, which already saw a 16% decrease.

**Team Composition**

**Full-Time Contributors**: 8

* Developers: 4
* Product Manager: 1
* Data Scientists: 2
* Workstream Lead: 1

**Part-Time or Shared Contributors:** 8

* Support: 2
* Design: 1
* DevRel: 2
* DevOps: 2
* Operations: 1

**Key Changes**

* Executed a headcount reduction to maintain budgetary discipline.
* Slashed the DevRel budget by 45% impacting our ability to fund bounties and hackathons.

**Note**: This was a strategic move to achieve a >20% overall reduction, making room for a dedicated Data Science role focused on Passport.

Funding Period: This updated funding proposal targets Season S20 and S21, spanning from November 1, 2023 to April 30, 2024.

We encourage governance stakeholders to provide feedback and raise queries, as your insights are crucial for our ongoing improvement.

Thank you for your attention and participation. Feel free to dive deeper into any areas of concern or interest.

            <p>I will be voting yes on this proposal, and looking forward to S20/21 of Passport.</p>
<p>Things I‚Äôll be following closely:</p>
<ol>
<li>How does Passport evolve with the recent additions of cluster mapping/data analytics/data science skills to the team?</li>
<li>How does Passport respond to ‚Äúno friction‚Äù competitors in the market that can provide sybil resistance without the overhead of users having to create stamps.</li>
<li>How does the market perceive Passport as an offering?  Passport has been called ‚ÄúKYC‚Äù or ‚Äúdoxxing‚Äù by some on twitter, and I don‚Äôt think thats really accurate as Passport has been designed with privacy from the beginning.  How can we shape the markets perception through education?</li>

[Proposal] Passport Season 20 & 21 Budget Request
Jeremy

            <p>Thank you for the detailed feedback!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Passport has improved by leaps and bounds over the past few seasons ‚Äì both UI-wise and in increasing the cost of forgery for sybils / airdrop farmers. The combo of passport + cluster-match QF feels pretty powerful right now!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ccerv1">@ccerv1</a> we‚Äôve worked hard on the trying to improve the end user experience!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I appreciate this team‚Äôs openness when it comes to assessing where targets have been met and fallen short. I also appreciate the strong focus on partnerships and creating revenue + utility for GTC. It was cool to see passport emerging as one of the top apps on Optimism and using Ethereum Attestation Service last season!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again thank you! We had aggressive targets and while it was disappointing to not hit our goal of 1M Passports, I‚Äôm VERY proud of what the team was able to accomplish in the last 2 seasons.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, the UX remains a polarizing issue. Last round, there remained frustration from experienced Ethereum users and newer folks alike. Growing the user base =/= improving the UX. I love the vision of an ‚Äúeasy-to-use app that makes it possible for web3 citizens to establish credibility‚Äù but I‚Äôd also like to see some user data from outside Gitcoin‚Äôs core community to gauge how close we are to this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Got it. Good perspective. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre fully done here! I do think that the UX and the overall effectiveness can be at odds at times (e.g. the harder it is the less likely we‚Äôll get Sybils). Part of the current experiments and learning are around improving the experience for humans while also making it harder for Sybils. We haven‚Äôt always gotten this balance correct. We‚Äôre starting to develop a hypothesis around a smaller number of better stamps. We‚Äôll have more on this over the next couple of months as we learn more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Second, I worry that Passport could be over-indexed on Gitcoin‚Äôs use case and at risk of being eclipsed by solutions that assign a Sybil / reputation score without any additional interactions required by users (eg, Trusta Labs) OR are highly optimized to creating a community-specific web of trust (eg, Optimism‚Äôs badgeholder referral system). I‚Äôd kinda like to see one of those marketing ‚Äúcompetitive analysis‚Äù matrices and see where Passport rates its feature being strongest ‚Äì and then really driving hard on those requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We‚Äôre in agreement here. I‚Äôm very concerned that the current product might be too much friction (given you point above) for end users and that could reduce our adoption. We‚Äôre exploring, with the new data scientists we‚Äôve hired, lighter weight options including both additional APIs and data sets to improve the ways partners can work with Passport. We could end up with a major product pivot, or a new product, it‚Äôs too early tell at this stage. It‚Äôs not in the roadmap (yet) as we don‚Äôt have anything concrete here.</p>

<p>Again, I am impressed by this workstream, its ability to ship fast, experiment towards PMF, and drive revenue. I will be voting yes ‚Äì with high hopes for what this team accomplishes in the coming seasons.</p>

            <p>The Passport team has an immense challenge ahead of them tackling one of the biggest problems in the Web3. That said, I couldn‚Äôt be more confident about the individuals that are currently staffed to take on these challenges and doing so with rigor and focus. I will be voting ‚Äòyes‚Äô to this budget proposal.</p>

            <p>Really looking forward to this next phase of Passport. It feels like we have a lot to tackle to get to PMF but are seeing traction with increased number of holders, having successful revenue experiments and overall growth of adoption. Onwards!</p>

            <p>Great progress. Increasing revenue, utility, and adoption, while maintaining a relatively flat budget is an impressive achievement under these market conditions. I also appreciate the thought that went into this proposal. I‚Äôm supportive of this budget.</p>
<p>That said, I recommend that the workstream lead consistently evaluate the pace of achievements against targets this season. If necessary, they should consider budgeting for and onboarding a FT BD contributor next season to accelerate progress towards the goals set.</p>

<p>This seeks funding for the Gitcoin Passport workstream for Seasons 20 and 21 (Nov 1, 2023 - Apr 30, 2024). The proposal has been reviewed and coordinated with CSDO and key Stewards, namely, <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle">@kyle</a> <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/meglister">@meglister</a> <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/viriya">@Viriya</a> <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/vinayvasanji">@vinayvasanji</a>. We still want your feedback and find it crucial to optimize our roadmap.</p>
<h2><a name="tldr-2" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#tldr-2"></a>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Gitcoin Passport aims to be the go-to solution for web3 identity management. In Seasons 20 and 21, we‚Äôll concentrate on five key pillars:</p>
<ol>
<li>Effectiveness: Improve identity scoring models</li>
<li>Adoption: Grow to 1.5M passports</li>
<li>GTC Utility: Strengthen GTC-based identity and community ties</li>
<li>Data: Enhance and aggregate Sybil detection and data sets</li>
<li>Partnerships: Increase both API and onchain partnerships</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="outline-3" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#outline-3"></a>Outline</h2>
<p>Gitcoin Passport is the premier solution for easy-to-use identity management tools that protect communities from Sybils and bots. Our easy-to-use app makes it possible for web3 citizens to establish credibility and build online reputation while preserving privacy and user control and our API lets web3 communities access a powerful layer of security with just a few lines of code.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Achievements:</strong> In Season 18 and 19, we identified early signs of product-market fit, marked by a 3x user growth and a 6x increase in GTC Staking.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives for Seasons 20 and 21</strong>: This table lists the milestones and deliverables we plan to tackle. While they are in a loose priority order, their final sequencing is still under evaluation.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
</div><p><strong>Note:</strong> The milestones are subject to change as we continue to assess the most effective order of implementation.</p>
<p>By focusing on these objectives, we aim to fortify Gitcoin Passport as the go-to solution for identity management in the web3 space.</p>

<p><a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s19-proposal-amended-passport-s19-budget-request/16184">Season 18 Update for S19 Budget Request</a></p>
<p>In Season 19, our growth was slower than expected, reaching 700k total passports which is 70% of our target of 1M. However, we exceeded expectations in GTC staking, hitting over 1M GTC against a target of 450k.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve also expanded our service offerings to include onchain Passports. The $2 mint fee saw good uptake, with almost 11k users moving their Passports onchain, even without partner-driven incentives.</p>

</div><p><strong>Observations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While we fell short on passport adoption, we found success in GTC staking, revealing a clear path for utility.</li>
<li>Revenue streams are starting to show promise.</li>
