    **Web3 Funding Fatigue: a growing problem**
*Investigating the funding fatigue in supply and demand side web3 public goods.*
Authors: Vengist + Owocki

# TLDR

"Funding fatigue" is a growing issue in Web3 public goods funding.

Grantees experience fatigue from maintaining and promoting multiple grants across platforms, while funders face overwhelming requests and high attention costs in evaluating numerous proposals. The system's complexity is a barrier for both sides.

Proposed solutions:

* **Aggregation**: Aggregating labour supply and demand.
* **Mechanisms**: Introducing a "common app" for grantees, interoperable registry protocols, weighted lists for funding, and tools like Drips, 0xsplits, and Protocol Guild Forks to streamline the process.

# Introduction

Public goods funding in Web3 is essential but increasingly strained by "funding fatigue."

Grantees are overwhelmed by managing and promoting multiple grants across fragmented platforms, while funders struggle with an influx of proposals and high computational costs in evaluating them. This imbalance between supply and demand complicates the funding process.

Grantees face visibility challenges, needing constant promotion, while funders must navigate numerous deserving projects with limited resources. The system‚Äôs complexity worsens these issues.

Our proposed solution is aggregation. By formalizing grantee applications and funding decisions through tools like a ‚Äúcommon app,‚Äù registry protocols, and guilds, the process can be simplified, reducing strain on both funders and grantees. Protopian increase in probabilities that desired public goods are realized.

# Problems:

## Grantee fatigue: supply-side

Grantees have to maintain grants on many diff platforms, across (often) multiple grants. And for QF they have to shill each of them. This is causing grantee fatigue.

Combating the matthew‚Äôs effect: intensive effort to become visible in the distributed, complicated public goods funding ecosystem.

## Supply fatigue: demand-side

There are DAOs that are overwhelmed with requests for funding from multiple worthy (but attention consuming to validate) causes.

Computational overhead:: observing, orienting, deciding, acting all take too much computation currently for a funder to navigate the public goods funding ecosystem, mismatch of supply and demand. The system is currently very complicated, instead of complex.

# Solution

# Aggregation of Supply

**Grantee Common App** - a webapp that allows you to apply to multiple grant programs at once.

**Registry Protocol Interop** - build an a way to push/pull grants from one registry to another.

# Aggregation of Demand

One solution may be Weighted Lists of causes that share sales/marketing/governance responsibilities.

One important primitive here is the self-curating registry (SCRs), popularized by protocol guild. SCRS (and nested SCRS of SCRS) could self to aggregate demand to navigate the funding of the commons.

Useful tools: Drips, 0xsplits, Protocol Guild Forks

Computation savings: Aggregated guilds act as high level strategies that funders can more easily navigate. Each guild serves as specialized tactics down stream of high level strategies. The low governance overhead of the SCRs, simply maintenance of the registry‚Äôs weights, allows for low-cost formation and operation of guild-like entities.

Ex. A self-curating registry of ethereum public goods

Because SCRs are just a simple address with governance + splitting logic, they can be chained and nested together in a number of interesting ways.

Let's imagine creating an SCR to represent Ethereum Public Goods. Instead of individual contributors, we can just add various guilds with reputable contributions to public goods. We would only need to determine the orgs, and the funding flows directly through to their contributors, based on the logic local to their context.

Lets envision what funding flows look like before and after this fatigue issue is solved.

# Conclusion

Addressing "funding fatigue" in Web3 public goods funding is critical to ensuring a sustainable ecosystem. The current system overwhelms both grantees and funders, leading to inefficiencies and missed opportunities. By focusing on solutions that aggregate supply and demand locally, both sides can operate with more efficiency and legitimacy. Tools like a "common app" for grantees and funding guilds for funders could reduce complexity, lower computational overhead, and improve the overall flow of funding. Simplifying these processes is key to maintaining the health and vitality of the Web3 public goods ecosystem.

<pre><code class="lang-auto">TL;DR
- We introduce "initiatives" as a term to refer to ideation/macro planning in on-chain orgs (not proposals)
- Members create initiatives by locking gov tokens [some amount * some interval]
- The length of a lock boosts weight; Weight decays to the initial lock amount
- DAO sets an proposal/acceptance threshold (configurable)
- Anyone can "contribute" towards an Initiative (with on-chain clauses eg. None or Accepted before timestamp)
Outcomes
- Gov tokens removed from voting supply while locked
- Smaller token holders can lock for longer periods (boosted voice)
- A dynamic ranked on-chain priority board
- Incentives (contributions split eg. [ (5/30/65), (fee/supporters/treasury) ])
- Inverted capital allocation ( External committees can fund projects directly via this mechanism) 
- Issue bonds for locked token on an AMM to achieve a secondary.

            <p>Regarding the demand-side fatigue of evaluating projects, I‚Äôd highly encourage folks to look into the <strong>pairwise-preference based approaches</strong> that have been developed over the last few years. They‚Äôve gotten less attention than QF-based approaches but have a lot to recommend them from the perspective of cognitive overload.</p>
<p>The big lift is that they simplify the evaluation process: instead of evaluating every project in <em>absolute</em> terms, funders can make <em>relative</em> choices between projects ‚Äì much easier to do at scale.</p>
<p>These techniques were first (to my knowledge) developed by Colony with their <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3317445" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">BudgetBox</a> mechanism, which was picked up by General Magic with <a href="https://www.pairwise.vote/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Pairwise</a>, and by dOrg with <a href="https://pairdrop.daodrops.io/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Pairdrop</a>, so at this point there are multiple working implementations to play with.</p>

<p>We are trying to solve the portable profile problem at Karma by helping project owners aggregate all their grants, milestones, progress updates and roadmap in one place and onchain (as EAS attestations). <a href="https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/viaprize-2" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">See Example here</a>. We have about 3k project profiles and we see hundreds of projects posting updates on a weekly basis and keeping their project/grant updated. I am very interested in building this Common App given lot of the data is already in project‚Äôs GAP profile and this is a logical extension of it. Infact, multiple common apps can be built given that this data is all onchain and in clear structured format. Getting all the platforms onboard is the most challenging problem imho.</p>

            <p>Its an interesting solution but I think the current problems will just get transferred to the guilds who have less of an incentive to allocate effectively.</p>
<p>That said:</p>
<ul>
<li>Curated Registries are <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/pinched_fingers.png?v=12" title=":pinched_fingers:" class="emoji" alt=":pinched_fingers:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></li>
<li>Self service is with agency on the builder sider is good.</li>
<li>Building on chain reputation by consistently delivering to spec <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/pinched_fingers.png?v=12" title=":pinched_fingers:" class="emoji" alt=":pinched_fingers:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></li>
</ul>
<p>In an ideal world:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grantees can publish initiatives they are looking to get funded.</li>
<li>Initiatives map to macro themes set by Guild/Network</li>
<li>Discovery is facilitated by theme</li>
<li>Multiple Funding sources may fund themes or Initiatives</li>
<li>Funding sources evaluate delivery</li>
<li>Everything is on-chain.</li>

            <p>In case the guilds approach doesn‚Äôt take root, another detail piece I‚Äôve seen could be helpful is a portable profiles app/protocol for projects. So it‚Äôs easy for projects to own their grant listing and be able to easily pull it in to the specific grants program they‚Äôre applying to and make modifications necessary for the specific grant. Ideally that listing could be available across platforms, for example across Gitcoin, Charmverse, Giveth, Octant, etc.</p>
<p>Description of the problem: As the # of Gitcoin rounds has proliferated, when a project is eligible for multiple increasingly specific grant parameters there, they‚Äôve had to write multiple different applications (just Gitcoin rounds, not talking about all the other Web3 grants programs). If there was a way for a project to keep a stored core of what their project does, and add details specific to a specific funding team‚Äôs ask, that could streamline efforts from the project‚Äôs side.</p>
<p>The reason I think this might be more helpful for a project than say, a Google or Hackmd file with the project‚Äôs description, is that it also allows more flexibility when it comes to assigning streaming/drips, and also for any dashboard like apps like allow funders to see across different platforms and filter by stage, scale, focus vertical, region, any other common params.</p>
<p>The UI/api port for the project listing in any funding app would look like "Enter your core project description here or pull in from [The Protocol].</p>

<h2><a name="grantee-fatigue-supply-side-4" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#grantee-fatigue-supply-side-4"></a>Grantee fatigue: supply-side</h2>
<p>Grantees have to maintain grants on many diff platforms, across (often) multiple grants. And for QF they have to shill each of them. This is causing grantee fatigue.</p>
<p>Combating the matthew‚Äôs effect: intensive effort to become visible in the distributed, complicated public goods funding ecosystem.</p>
<h2><a name="supply-fatigue-demand-side-5" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#supply-fatigue-demand-side-5"></a>Supply fatigue: demand-side</h2>
<p>There are DAOs that are overwhelmed with requests for funding from multiple worthy (but attention consuming to validate) causes.</p>
<p>Computational overhead:: observing, orienting, deciding, acting all take too much computation currently for a funder to navigate the public goods funding ecosystem, mismatch of supply and demand. The system is currently very complicated, instead of complex.</p>

<h1><a name="aggregation-of-supply-7" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#aggregation-of-supply-7"></a>Aggregation of Supply</h1>
<p><strong>Grantee Common App</strong> - a webapp that allows you to apply to multiple grant programs at once.</p>
<p><strong>Registry Protocol Interop</strong> - build an a way to push/pull grants from one registry to another.</p>
<h1><a name="aggregation-of-demand-8" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#aggregation-of-demand-8"></a>Aggregation of Demand</h1>
<p>One solution may be Weighted Lists of causes that share sales/marketing/governance responsibilities.</p>
<p>One important primitive here is the self-curating registry (SCRs), popularized by protocol guild. SCRS (and nested SCRS of SCRS) could self to aggregate demand to navigate the funding of the commons.</p>
<p>Useful tools: Drips, 0xsplits, Protocol Guild Forks</p>
<p>Computation savings: Aggregated guilds act as high level strategies that funders can more easily navigate. Each guild serves as specialized tactics down stream of high level strategies. The low governance overhead of the SCRs, simply maintenance of the registry‚Äôs weights, allows for low-cost formation and operation of guild-like entities.</p>
<p>Ex. A self-curating registry of ethereum public goods</p>
<p>Because SCRs are just a simple address with governance + splitting logic, they can be chained and nested together in a number of interesting ways.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs imagine creating an SCR to represent Ethereum Public Goods. Instead of individual contributors, we can just add various guilds with reputable contributions to public goods. We would only need to determine the orgs, and the funding flows directly through to their contributors, based on the logic local to their context.</p>

<h1><a name="conclusion-9" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#conclusion-9"></a>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Addressing ‚Äúfunding fatigue‚Äù in Web3 public goods funding is critical to ensuring a sustainable ecosystem. The current system overwhelms both grantees and funders, leading to inefficiencies and missed opportunities. By focusing on solutions that aggregate supply and demand locally, both sides can operate with more efficiency and legitimacy. Tools like a ‚Äúcommon app‚Äù for grantees and funding guilds for funders could reduce complexity, lower computational overhead, and improve the overall flow of funding. Simplifying these processes is key to maintaining the health and vitality of the Web3 public goods ecosystem.</p>
