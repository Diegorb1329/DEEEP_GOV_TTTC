Knowledge Transfer; Vitalik Buterin's reviews of Gitcoin Grants
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/knowledge-transfer-vitalik-buterins-reviews-of-gitcoin-grants/11570
    I was talking with a Gitcoin community member at Messari Mainnet last week, who had not realized that Vitalik Buterin wrote [reviews of Gitcoin Grants Rounds 3-9](https://vitalik.ca/categories/gitcoin.html).

Here they are:

- [Gitcoin Grants Round 9: The Next Phase of Growth](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/02/round9.html)
- [Gitcoin Grants Round 7 Retrospective](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/10/18/round7.html)
- [Gitcoin Grants Round 6 Retrospective](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/07/22/round6.html)
- [Gitcoin Grants Round 5 Retrospective](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/04/30/round5.html)
- [Review of Gitcoin Quadratic Funding Round 4](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/01/28/round4.html)
- [Review of Gitcoin Quadratic Funding Round 3](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/10/24/gitcoin.html)

As you may know, Vitalik is both the founder of Ethereum and the [author of the original Quadratic Funding paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06421.pdf).  He is both the brainchild of the matching formula behind Gitcoin Grants + Gitcoin Grant's first (and most influential) customer, so to me that meant his takes on Gitcoin Grants were extra important.

During this span of time, we entered into a theory/practice/results loop with Vitalik in which he would propose ideas, we would implement them.  Then he would write about how those experiments went.  

Experiments we ran:

0. New Matching calculators in the UI
1. Media Rounds
2. Negative Voting
3. a bunch of stuff around sybil ressitence 
4. [pairwise matching](https://ethresear.ch/t/pairwise-coordination-subsidies-a-new-quadratic-funding-design/5553)
5. L2 integrations
6. Subscriptions
7. Grant collections
7. and plenty more, you can follow [this thread](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1540257178233106433) to see the experiments in progress.

That loop of theory/practice/results with Vitalik has not been super tight as Vitalik has been focused on the Merge, and Gitcoin has been focused on figuring out it's DAO/Grants2 future, but it's always possible that loop may recur after Grants 2 launches.  As a result, Vitalik has not written a Gitcoin Grants review since round 9.

Another development worth noting is that Vitalik is focused on a public goods funding ecosystem that is no longer just Gitcoin.  There are multiple CLR/QF tools now, [Optimism/Retroactive Public Goods Funding](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/11/16/retro1.html) is happening, and there are other [public goods funding projects that have legitimacy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html).  The future of [public goods funding is pluralistic](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-vision-for-a-pluralistic-civilizational-scale-infrastructure-for-funding-public-goods/9503).  Perhaps future Vitalik reviews of Grants 2 will cover Grants 2's modularity & interoperability with other pluralistic tools!

I am writing this post in order to highlight these to members of GitcoinDAO as part of a knowledge transfer.  If you joined GitcoinDAO in 2021-2022, you likely were not a part of Gitcoin during the time in which Vitalik was deeply engaged. As grants 2 approaches product market fit in both Ethereum + NFT/DEFI/L2 ecosystems, perhaps there are some nuggets of wisdom in the above posts.  Afterall, what works well in Ethereum + Vitalik champions might be a guiding light for will works in other ercosystems as Grants 2 grows both horizontally (to DEFI/NFT/L2s/alt-l1s) and vertically (deepens in Ethereum).
