    Hi Gitcoin community, 

Here is a project proposal to create a more sustainable food system and improve smallholder farmers life. [Food and non fungible token](https://medium.com/@jrepusseau/food-product-centered-information-system-using-standard-non-fongible-token-and-permissionless-a28cf6119153)
The idea is straight forward, every farmers could own  digital asset as NFT of their food production and any processors, restaurant or retailers that use this product can own a parent NFT that will refer to the NFT unique ID. 
Please let us know if you feel connected as well to this idea, 
Have a good day! 
Love and Peace to the community
