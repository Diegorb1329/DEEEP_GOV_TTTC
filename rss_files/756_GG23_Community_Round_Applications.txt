GG23 Community Round Applications
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg23-community-round-applications/19940
    GG23 Community Round Applications are LIVE! Below you‚Äôll find the process to apply:

### TL;DR

Our application process will now run on Grant Ships. Grant Ships is an evolutionary grants framework designed to refine and advance best practices through a dynamic mix of competition, collaboration, and skill-sharing among grant programs. Selected grant programs ‚Äî known as ‚ÄúShips‚Äù ‚Äî innovate and engage in a public arena, where they are observed and evaluated by the community and/or designated judges. These assessments set each Ship‚Äôs starting position for the next round, rewarding top performers and allowing new Ships to join. This iterative cycle drives continuous innovation, leading to ever-improving strategies and outcomes.

### Grant Ships process

### Stage 1: [Judge Election](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/2025-delegate-nominations/19903)

* These judges will evaluate round applications and oversee the process.

### Stage 2: Round Selection

* Top applicants are selected as GG Community Rounds.

### Stage 3: GG23 Community Rounds

* Selected rounds run their Community Round in GG23.
* Impact and achievements are recorded for review.
* Performance is tracked onchain by Round Operators to ensure transparency.

### Stage 4: Review & Future Selection

* Judges and GTC holders review each Community Round‚Äôs self-reported success metrics.
* Rounds are scored based on their execution, impact, and engagement.
* The top 3 rounds are automatically selected for the next Gitcoin Grants round.

            <p>Thank you for extending the deadline and informing about it on the forum.</p>
<p>There is another post by another user titled <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/my-disastrous-experience-in-gg22/20023">My Disastrous Experience in GG22</a>. My experience was not ideal either, in fact I‚Äôm marching from one rejection to another.

In fact I‚Äôve opened quite a lot of issues:</p>
