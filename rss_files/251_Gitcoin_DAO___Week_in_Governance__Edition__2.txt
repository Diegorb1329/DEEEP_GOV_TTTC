Gitcoin DAO - Week in Governance, Edition #2
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-dao-week-in-governance-edition-2/7777
    This is the second edition of our weekly post with the ambition to summarise what‚Äôs been going on in the Gitcoin DAO Governance. Topics, ideas, proposals, and votes will be listed with links for further reading and discussion. If there‚Äôs anything missing please reach out! üìù

### [ü§ñ Meta-Governance](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/governance-meta/6)

* Anett and Yalor are continuing to help steward meta-governance in their [thread](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/stewards-calls-all-info/7410) aimed at increasing the transparency of Stewards Calls by posting details and notes. The post outlines the agenda for the #1 monthly Gitcoin DAO Steward Call that will take place on the 5th of July.

* The [formal proposal](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gitcoin-seasons/7319) introducing Gitcoin Seasons by fireeyes, üî•_üî•, last week has sparked a more general conversation after a [post](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gitcoin-seasons/7319/2) by lefterisjp on how Stewards should be compensated. 

* A new but related [proposal](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gitcoin-builds-gitcoindao-gtc-incentive-proposal/7617) was put forward in parallel to ratify a one-time allocation for GR10 and ‚Äúincentive to help dogfood grants which support the GitcoinDAO‚Äù.

* Toby, Simona, Ken, and others are actively working towards an updated governance process including a more precise definition of workstreams to help frame the discussion around workstream specific compensation.

* Discussions around the unclaimed tokens from the GTC airdrop continue to be active in two threads [1](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/2-117-884-unclaimed-gtc-tokens/7237) & [2](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-second-claim-window-for-gtc/7388). Yalor provided a [summary](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-second-claim-window-for-gtc/7388/36) of the discussion.

* Bobjiang shared an [update](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-chinese-ecosystem-meeting-1/7695) on the Gitcoin Chinese Ecosystem after their first group meeting earlier in the week.

### [üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Workstream Discussion](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/workstream-discussion/9)

[Public Goods Funding / Treasury Management](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-public-goods-funding/129)

* Gitcoin Grants Round 10 was a huge success. Owocki started a [thread](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/grants-data-round-over-round/7639) on Grants Data Round over Round with [dashboards](https://gitcoin.co/results) and stats of the Grants Rounds.

* The [Gitcoin Building Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/grants/explorer/gitcoindao) round showed off a range of projects in the GitcoinDAO ecosystem, if you have a project that you‚Äôd like to include in the next round please add it!

* The discussion around what constitutes a public good continues. Among other questions, pet3rpan started a [proposal discussion](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-should-vc-funded-projects-get-clr-matched-funding/2505) around whether VC backed projects should be included. Defining rules for inclusion in grants rounds seems like a strong priority.

* Progress on executing the Akita vote continues, with Austin Griffith creating a [website](https://akitarescue.dog/) app that lets Gitcoin approve certain amounts of Akita to be sold at the current market price.

* Shreyas and others are continuing to draft a first version of a treasury management strategy to be executed by the Public Goods Funding workstream.

* The BrightID team and others have noted issues with rounds going over saturation resulting in incorrect match amounts (the point at which matching calculations according to QF exceed the funds available in the matching pool) and are writing a proposed solution.

[Public Goods Prototyping (Moonshot Collective)](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-public-goods-prototyping/130)

* First pass of the website is [live](http://moonshotcollective.space/) with shiny new designs being shared across [Figma files](https://gyazo.com/a836649afc0fccacccea968acebcba61).

* The workstream will kick off officially at [EthCC](https://ethcc.io/) in Paris the week of 7/19, anyone with ideas for prototypes that help push public goods forward is encouraged to join.

[Decentralization Workstream](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-decentralize-gitcoin/180)

* Philip has closed out the architecture phase (including the tech stack) and begun development of decentralized grants independent from the core team.

* A GitHub [organization and repositories](https://github.com/dcgtc) have been created for anyone to track progress.

* The [grant for further funding the decentralized grants workstream](https://gitcoin.co/grants/2929/decentralize-gitcoin-grants) has been very successful raising over $30k with matching.

* A [discussion ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-co-data-stewardship/7663)about what responsible data stewardship on the existing Gitcoin.co marketplace looks like was started by Owocki.

[Anti-Sybil Workstream](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-anti-fraud-workstream-assemble/158)

* Recruited community members and stewards to participate in evaluation of users for sybil behavior to train the ML algorithm.

* Performed statistical analysis to estimate percentage of sybil accounts. This is used to determine accuracy of the ML algorithm. The machine learning group found the estimated fraud tax from GR10 to be 14.5k, which is down from GR9‚Äôs $33k. This is a 2.05% taxation quotient.

* Grant Disputes have been cataloged in a public Notion and automated to show on the GitcoinDisputes twitter.

* DistruptionJoe wrote up the closing steps and ratification process for Grants Round 10. Check it out on the [Governance Forum](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/closing-out-grants-round-10/7662).

* Working on sybil-resistance mechanism design with Moonshot Collective & Decentralizing Grants workstream.

[Merch, Memes, Marketing Workstream](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-suggestion-mmm-merch-memes-marketing-for-public-goods-gitcoin-gitcoindao/7066)

* Initial mockups of a map of the quadratic lands have been started to help new participants navigate the GitcoinDAO ecosystem.

* Fred and Chris are continuing to push forward the [meme contest](https://gitcoin.co/blog/meme-lords-earn-eth-win-prizes/) in partnership with Stateful Works.

That‚Äôs it for this week in Gitcoin DAO governance, feel free join the discussions via the links and on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/gitcoin)!
