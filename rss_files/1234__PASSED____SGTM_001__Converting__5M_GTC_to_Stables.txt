https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/passed-sgtm-001-converting-5m-gtc-to-stables/18583
    *NB: This is one proposal of many, following the Treasury Mgmt discussion shared on 09 April [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/temp-check-comprehensive-treasury-management-strategy-for-gitcoin-gitcoins-2024-strategy-v1/18564)*

# Kudos

Thanks to @owocki for lighting the fire + co-authoring this post, @Jeremy for spot-checking, and @darwinmvr and @Sor03 for supporting the numbers.

## TL;DR:

The bull market is here.

**We are asking for $5M in GTC from the treasury to swap into stables and put back into the treasury to be prepared for the next bear market**.

We'll repeat this cycle with additional proposals once the cycle from this proposal has been completed. We aim to lay the tracks for a longer Gitcoin runway.

## Background

With approximately [30M GTC](https://etherscan.io/address/0x57a8865cfB1eCEf7253c27da6B4BC3dAEE5Be518) in our timelock, we want to strategically expand our stablecoin reserves.

## How we see it:

* 1 year of bull market

* 1 year of bear market

* 2-3 years of boring sideways chop.

* (repeat)

To achieve sufficient runway over the next 12 to 18 months, we're proposing the following approach to incrementally divest our GTC holdings:

* For a 12-month strategy: We propose to methodically sell approximately ~300K GTC each week.

* Extending to an 18-month timeline: A more gradual approach would involve selling around ~200K GTC weekly.

**NB - this is unrelated to the current swaps we execute for workstreams, business units, and the Foundation wallets. We'll be monitoring prices and liquidity (hawkishly) to maintain a steady uptick in these transactions.*

## Treasury Diversification Plan

* **Incremental Sales:** Utilize a Dollar-Cost Averaging approach to sell GTC, aligning sales with market conditions to avoid significant impact.

* **Price-Optimized Sellin**g: Implement limit orders for a portion of the GTC, aiming to capture value while managing market dynamics efficiently.

* **OTC Transactions:** Over-the-counter deals to move larger amounts of GTC without affecting exchange prices, ensuring our actions don't disrupt the market.

* **Liquidity Management:** Conduct these sales during high liquidity periods to minimize slippage, aligning with our commitment to market stewardship.

*NB: These swaps will all be on-chain to remain transparent and trackable to the community.*

## Proposal for Management of funds:

**Option A:** Gitcoin's Foundation can spearhead these initiatives, repeating proposals until we hit targets.

* This would ensure speedier transactions, still go through governance, and hold a singular accountability
* Cons: Given current capacity, more challenging to report (however, everything will be on-chain and we can include in the Foundation's monthly financial report). 

**Option B:** Form a council for executing these swaps and managing updates, using a 3/5 multisig.

* This ensures strategic and democratic use of these funds
* Cons: Slows down the process by chasing a group of people to propose, review and execute swaps


We can facilitate the formation of *yet another council* to oversee the swaps for the funds being requested and be stewards of future cycles. This group would oversee the direct diversification efforts of the treasury and coordinate with DAO multi-sig signers to ensure all financial movements align with our overarching strategy (as mentioned above). This council's could responsibilities include:

* Submitting DAO proposals for reallocating funds, similar to this proposal's initial $5M to be approved.

* Proposing and executing swaps in a staggered and strategic manner.

* Report back to the community with status of reserves and yields. 

*The council is not permitted to do anything other than the above responsibilities.*


## Community Engagement and Governance

This proposal is a collaborative effort. We invite the Gitcoin community to actively participate in refining, endorsing, and implementing this strategy, ensuring its alignment with our collective goals.

## Looking Forward

By securing additional reserves in USDC, we're taking Gitcoin out of survival mode and planning for sustained innovation and growth, even in challenging market conditions.

Calling out loud and clear one final time, this is not the only proposal that will be brought forward for treasury diversification.

This strategy falls within a lower risk/easier execution vector - expect more proposals to follow, and further (meatier) discussions to come out of it @ccerv1 :wink:. 

## Clarifications and Final Thoughts

* For direct execution, funds will be sent to Coinbase, avoiding the need for an intermediary multisig. This is an option though, and feels more effective for the initial execution.

* IF deemed imperative by this group - We invite community nominations for council members, seeking individuals committed to transparency, strategic financial oversight, and regular communication. 

* While optimistic, we're aware of market volatility risks. Our strategy includes constant market monitoring and flexibility in our approach to adapt as necessary. We'd (I) would love to keep GTC within our coffers as much as possible, and welcome feedback on holding our governance token in high regard.



Once we've received feedback from the community - we will move to a formal proposal with the following votes:

* Yes, fund the $5M and execute directly via Coinbase.

* Yes, fund the $5M and form a council for execution.

* No, do not fund the swaps

* Abstain

            <p>Good point Mars. It did coincide with some major market downward movements (BTC down ~15%), which make it hard to solely attribute the GTC dip (of ~35%) to this post. So I will concede that point.</p>
<p>I hope that the other points don‚Äôt get lost in my comment tho:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We should put more effort into creating utility for GTC so OTC deals can be easier to close.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hopefully we don‚Äôt store funds on CEXs longer than it takes to execute the trades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coinbase is is not the most liquid CEX, we should use multiple CEXs.</p>
</li>

            <p>I have to vote against this proposal. I don‚Äôt believe it is in the best interest of the DAO in it‚Äôs current form.</p>
<p>Of course I support measures of treasury diversification, but I would personally rather see more efforts towards creating utility and demand for GTC,  and then promoting those efforts to strategic partners and sell them GTC OTC, than see us, as a DAO, publicly signal to the market, that we intend to dump GTC.</p>
<p>Before this post, the price of GTC was $1.76.</p>
<p>Less than 2 days after this post, the price dipped to $1.13</p>

<p>Imagine if the post said:</p>
<p>We have big plans for the GTC token, and want to move 5M GTC to the foundation to make OTC deals with strategic investors for stablecoins.</p>
<p>How different would things have been‚Ä¶ hard to say of course, lots of confounding variables.</p>
<p>THAT SAID:</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt have much voting power and it looks like the coinbase approach will probably win‚Ä¶ If so PLEASE do not hold funds on Coinbase or any other centralized exchange.</p>
<p>A wise man once said, <em><strong>‚ÄúCentralized exchanges are like public bathrooms, go in, do your business and get out. Don‚Äôt linger!‚Äù</strong></em></p>
<p>Only send what you want to sell to the exchange and then withdraw. You never know when Coinbase‚Äôs compliance crew decides that DAOs selling their own currency is a sketchy thing and then freezes it, not to mention all the other obvious issues that can arise.</p>
<p>Also, there is 2x-10x more liquidity 6 other exchanges (at the time of posting this), so it would be wise to not commit to one exchange but to play the market and use several exchanges to avoid slippage.</p>

            <p>The multi-sig seems like a plausible solution and one that can fit into an ‚Äòall things being equal‚Äô vein.</p>
<p>For your initial concern <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/deltajuliet">@deltajuliet</a>  <strong>Option B:</strong> Form a council for executing these swaps and managing updates, using a 3/5 multisig.</p>
<ul>
<li>This ensures strategic and democratic use of these funds</li>
<li>Cons: Slows down the process by chasing a group of people to propose, review and execute swaps</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps whomever is tapped, or steps up, for the multi-sig be required to sign a formal agreement with Gitcoin/DAO that they be responsive to all action items within a 36 hour window, for example?  Your concern about having to ‚Äòchase people‚Äô is valid and should not have to be a concern when dealing with responsible and conscientious members of a professional organization.</p>
<p>I do, still, find that <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/mars">@mars</a> suggestions resonate. Stables are great but also BTC, SOL and ETH. As well as some hard asset holdings such as prime real estate (my suggestion).</p>
<p>In any case, this seems acceptable:  <em>Yes, fund the $5M and transfer it to the newly established diversification wallet.‚Äù</em>   w/ the caveat of your note ‚Äòwhen favorable market conditions arise.‚Äô</p>
<p>Thank you for all the reflection and thoughtful considerations that have gone into, and is going into, this.</p>
<p>Longevity for Gitcoin is certainly the desired goal and outcome.</p>

<p>I do not anticipate any strategic voting, I think the proposal is simple to explain and simple to understand. I‚Äôve seen similar mechanics <em>(combining multiple options)</em> already in the wild. Not sure how easy / how hard to describe using Snapshot syntax. My personal market condition assessment is that with 10x ETF and halving, inflation, interest rates, global geopolitical instability, multipolar world, reducing dependency on USD and petrodollar I think that over long time horizon the number will go up while ‚Äújust stables‚Äù will lose the purchasing power.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT / UPDATE:</strong> decision fatigue. I don‚Äôt know which diversification option to choose, too complicated, I‚Äôll just pick ‚Äúno‚Äù. Unlikely, the options are not that complicated.</p>

            <p>As per input received from our Gov Gurus <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/coachjonathan">@CoachJonathan</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/jengajojo">@jengajojo</a> I have amendments to make to this proposal before moving to Snapshot.</p>

<p><strong>TL:DR</strong> - we won‚Äôt move funds to Coinbase or leverage a council (just now) if not agreed on by vote. Instead we propose to set up a diversification multi-sig (3/5) to execute the swaps at the appropriate time. I‚Äôm open to who those signers would be, and would request that one of our finance team <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/sor03">@Sor03</a> or <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/darwinmvr">@darwinmvr</a> be included for reporting. I can give an update once this proposal is ready to be executed on (again).</p>
<h2> Updates </h2>
<p><strong>Change in Execution Method</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We are moving away from using Coinbase for direct execution. Instead, proposing establishment of a new 3/5 multisig wallet.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Revised Community Voting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reflecting the change in execution strategy, the updated voting option will be:<br>
<em>‚ÄúYes, fund the $5M and transfer it to the newly established diversification wallet.‚Äù</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Given the current state of the market, we‚Äôve missed the current window but will be ready to execute when favorable market conditions arise - once the funds are in the MS. I still intend to engage partners in a Phase 1/2 of the diversification, however want to make sure we‚Äôre not losing steam in the interim.</p>
<p>I appreciate everyone‚Äôs feedback on this post! There are some great learnings, and I‚Äôll endeavour to breakdown more context (like platforms we can/can‚Äôt work with as a Cayman entity) and partners/strategies we‚Äôre evaluating. I‚Äôll also use the <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/temp-check-sgtm-000-treasury-management-strategy-for-gitcoin-v1/18564">initial post</a> to track these proposals and partners in the future.</p>

            <p>Hello Gitcoin fam! <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/wave.png?v=12" title=":wave:" class="emoji" alt=":wave:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>I‚Äôm Spike from Avantgarde Finance and my role is to cover DAO governance.</p>
<p>GITCOIN is a cornerstone project and its importance for the ecosystem cannot be overstated. We believe the discussion around treasury management is an extremely valuable one and are happy to provide some insights which we hope the community will find useful.</p>
<p>As <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/deltajuliet">@deltajuliet</a> put in her post</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="deltajuliet" data-post="1" data-topic="18564">

<blockquote>
<p>The simple goal is to fortify Gitcoin‚Äôs assets.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>We certainly agree on the direction and would like to see discussion around the practical nuances of implementing this. What we particularly liked is that:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="deltajuliet" data-post="1" data-topic="18564">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
<img loading="lazy" alt="" width="24" height="24" src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/user_avatar/gov.gitcoin.co/deltajuliet/48/10158_2.png" class="avatar"><a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/temp-check-sgtm-000-treasury-management-strategy-for-gitcoin-v1/18564/1">[TEMP CHECK] SGTM 000 - Treasury Management Strategy for Gitcoin - V1</a></div>
<blockquote>
<p>We are actively reviewing multiple asset sources for strategic management, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Matching Pool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DAO Treasury</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CSDO Wallet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Workstream Multi-sig Wallets</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>And this is one of the critical considerations throughout this discussion - to understand the ‚Äúuses‚Äù and ‚Äúsources‚Äù of funding. We would suggest that additional quantitative analysis should go into the amount of stables conversion (or if this has already been done, we feel it would be useful to share with the community from an auditability and accountability perspective how the figure of 5mUSD has been reached).</p>
<p>Additionally</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most notable is yield generation strategy</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Is also a certainly important point for analysis, and though we appreciate this might be under consideration in subsequent proposals, a more holistic approach that takes potential revenue from yield and the final composition of the treasury as a whole into account may better define the optimal size and choice of stablecoin(s).</p>
<p>We believe the final composition of the treasury and choice of strategies should be informed by the risk capacity and tolerance of the DAO, which is itself formed by its financial position and objectives. In our experience, establishing a comprehensive framework incorporating these elements and agreed upon by the community can lead to a more sustainable treasury management operation rather than ad hoc proposals for each individual decision around the treasury.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We aim to improve our financial resilience against downturns by carefully selecting swap partners and terms.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Another important consideration when implementing treasury diversification is managing price impact on the DAO‚Äôs native token - given the liquidity of GTC, we feel it is prudent that market depth should be factored into the sizing and timing of swaps.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>should we consider the formation of the GTMC to oversee and execute our financial strategies?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There are many advantages to having a body oversee effective execution of treasury management (and many DAOs choose this approach) - this can be an internal committee / external treasury manager or a combination of both depending on the preferences of the community.The scope of work for a proposed committee is very large in terms of expertise required, which is why GITCOIN may engage external service providers and/or consultants (though each DAO is unique, and the nature of engagement differs based on their goals &amp; objectives).</p>
<p>We fully commend the importance and intent of the initial post, though from our perspective we would caution against executing this 5mUSD transaction before a holistic treasury management framework is considered, which is in line with the intent in the extremely well-written SGTM 000 temp check.</p>
<p>We appreciate that a lot of thought has undoubtedly gone into this initiative and that the breadth of talent across the GITCOIN community can lead to successful execution on this. From Avantgarde‚Äôs perspective, we would be happy to provide any insights, analysis, or assistance with implementation where the community might find it beneficial.</p>

            <p>Excited to see this level-headed initiative to ensure Gitcoin‚Äôs continuity during an inevitable future bear market <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/deltajuliet">@deltajuliet</a>!</p>
<p>I‚Äôm wondering whether it makes sense to use a mix of stablecoins instead of just USDC. It‚Äôd further diversify treasury and boosts Ethereum‚Äôs resilience (<a href="https://www.stablecoindiversity.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">see page on Stablecoin Diversity</a>).</p>
<p>As Glo Dollar‚Äôs CTO, I‚Äôd love to explore if all or part of the $5M could be swapped into Glo Dollars (USDGLO) instead of USDC. It ticks the boxes for treasury diversification and Ethereum resilience + after <a href="https://twitter.com/glodollar/status/1775151425863213430" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">our upgrade to Glo Dollar 2.0</a> the holdings could generate up to $250K in funding for Web3 Public Goods each year, at no cost to Gitcoin <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/magic_wand.png?v=12" title=":magic_wand:" class="emoji" alt=":magic_wand:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>Getting Gitcoin‚Äôs endorsement has been pivotal for us; since <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0xd43f0a882b581e41bea6c0b162f2eab3b425a8cea5cbfa6da65e11a21ce364be" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">the previous swap</a>, we‚Äôve doubled our market cap and welcomed other leading Web3 orgs like Polygon as holders of Glo Dollar.</p>
<p>In other news, we recently received our <a href="https://bluechip.org/coins/usdglo" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Bluechip stablecoin safety rating</a>, with an initial B grade‚Äîpositioning us as a top 10 fiat-backed stablecoin, deemed safer than the likes of USDT, FDUSD, and FRAX.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the clarification. I‚Äôd suggest keeping all native token sales private, the swap venue is not a concern as long as the foundation does it‚Äôs due diligence. Any other token swaps or yield farming opportunities could be onchain. Infact, I do recommend the foundation to deploy some of the stables and ETH which is not needed immediately into yield farming.</p>
<p>Since these operations require quick response the best course is usually to gauge the risk appetite of the community and deploy according to those parameters as opposed to asking the community for each operation the foundation wants to make.</p>

            <p>Thanks, <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/jengajojo">@jengajojo</a>!</p>
<p>I appreciate you highlighting the need for clarity around our swapping mechanisms, especially concerning the potential ‚Äòceiling price‚Äô impression from token sales. I acknowledge I could have been clearer in my wording.</p>
<p>On-chain swaps def ensure transparency and are trackable by the community, while off-chain methods like using Coinbase offer reduced costs and can handle large volumes securely.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs worth noting as well - <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/temp-check-sgtm-000-treasury-management-strategy-for-gitcoin-v1/18564/6">we are not solely relying on this for our diversification strategy</a>. I‚Äôm currently exploring solutions with over a number of partners and would love community input (including yours) on what would be an amenable solution.</p>
<p>Should we continue with an option like Coinbase for these swaps and update the proposal, or would another platform better align with the community? Now that you‚Äôve outlined the considerations you have - What are some proposed solutions that would change your vote to a ‚Äòyes‚Äô?</p>

<p>We need to agree on if these will be onchain or offchain in general before moving forward. Diversification plans solely oriented on token sales can give the community an impression of ‚Äòceiling price‚Äô, and it‚Äôs important to manage that. In other DAOs, much of the OTC deals happen on the Foundation level (where they can keep it confidential) for that exact same reason.</p>

            <p>Converting to stables is a good move.</p>
<p>Agree w/ this:<br>
<a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/deltajuliet">@deltajuliet</a> By securing additional reserves in USDC, we‚Äôre taking Gitcoin out of survival mode and planning for sustained innovation and growth, even in challenging market conditions.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/mars">@mars</a> Raises an interesting point about diversifying into BTC.  If not 50% then perhaps a portion?</p>
<p>I also fully support diversifying into RWA/ hard assets (such as property and real estate).  It seems the responsible path to take at least if we‚Äôre playing the long game here.</p>
<p>Either way I agree with this statement: Yes, fund the $5M and execute directly via Coinbase.</p>

            <p>This post is a few days old and $gtc in treasury is already down from 60m$ to 30m$, during a 3 month bull cycle $GTC almost gained 0 value.</p>
<p>Instead of using $GTC as fuel, you should come up with some reasonable ideas to get $GTC gain value. Otherwise, in a few years gitcoin will hardly find money to make payments as $GTC value will likely drop to a few cents.</p>

            <p>I think this proposal aligns with Gitcoin goals which stretch way farther than a single market cycle.<br>
Gitcoin should take advantage of up waves to make sure the public funding mission it carries stays well funded.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For direct execution, funds will be sent to Coinbase, avoiding the need for an intermediary multisig. This is an option though, and feels more effective for the initial execution.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Have you considered Binance or splitting, to maximize the available liquidity?</p>
<p>I want also to add that - without knowing about Gitcoin legal structure and limitations - i think Gitcoin should look into investing those USDC in on-chain T bills, to secure and minimum of interest on that capital, given that it could be a long time before it needs to use it.<br>
I would suggest considering one of the many solutions already available (Ondo, Openeden‚Ä¶) or Maker‚Äôs sDAI</p>

<p>1st thought: robust proposal, I generally support this course of action.</p>
<p>Have you considered $2.5m into stables <em>(ideally generating some yield)</em> and $2.5m into more liquid and less volatile crypto assets like BTC?</p>
<p>GTC is listed on Coinbase but it is Binance that is responsible for 50% of the overal volume, screenshot from <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gitcoin" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Coingecko</a>:<br>

<p>I know too little about Gitcoin legal structure and availability of the Binance in the US.</p>
