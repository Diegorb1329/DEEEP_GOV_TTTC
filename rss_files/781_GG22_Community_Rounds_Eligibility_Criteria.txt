https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg22-community-rounds-eligibility-criteria/19330
    ## GG22 Community Rounds Eligibility Criteria

The updated Community Round process was first introduced in GG20. For more context, you can [read the retrospective](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-community-round-governance-a-retrospective/18766). Below are the eligibility criteria set by the elected [GG Community Council](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/passed-extending-the-term-of-gg-community-council/18776) in partnership with Gitcoin.

Read the [GG21 Retrospective](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-first-community-led-round-gg21-results-retrospective/19318) to gain context on changes to previous rounds that are being implemented.

* Application Period: September 9 - 22, 2024.
* Round Selection: The Community Council will vote on the proposals; the council will decide on the amount of rounds & how to allocate matching funds depending on the quality of applications received.
* Proposal Template & Timeline: [Use this post](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg22-community-round-proposal-template/19331) as your resource if applying to GG22.
* Funding: There is a total of $125k from Gitcoin to be allocated across the top selected rounds.
* **NOTE:** There is a minimum of $5k matching that teams need to raise in order to be eligible to apply.
* **NOTE:** If you want to experiment with a different funding mechanism (e.g., Direct Grants, [Tunable QF](https://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/expertise-and-quadratic-funding-bd4f0c5c3e23), Conviction Voting, MACI QF, etc.), include this in your proposal for council review. All mechanisms must run on Allo Protocol. For more information, visit the [Grants Stack Resource Hub.](https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/Grants-Stack-Resources-ad7e4685d4154aecb4a488852a6102cf?pvs=4)

### Eligibility Criteria for GG22 Community Rounds

1. **Team Requirements:**

  * Identify at least one experienced* Round Operator and at least two partner team members who will act as reviewers or assist in managing the round.
    1. It is mandatory to have at least one Round Operator on your team who has experience in running rounds on Grants Stack (proof to be provided), or to have gone through training (proof to be provided).
    2. If your team has no experienced round operators, you may engage an available experienced round operator from a pool provided by Gitcoin, OR your team needs to undergo training hosted by Gitcoin.

2. **Matching Pool & Proof of Funds:**

  * Every round must raise its own matching pool, with a minimum of $5k raised by the proposed round.
  * Show proof of funds in a multisig wallet, similar to how funds are visible in Gitcoin‚Äôs multisig.
  * Proof of matching funds and plans for raised funds should be provided by the time applications are reviewed to assist council members.

3. **Mission Alignment:**

  * The round must align with one of the following intents:

**Allo GMV** (A round needs to reach 20% crowdfunding proportional to their matching pool. For example, if gitcoin provides $20k in matching the minimum amount of crowdfunding necessary would be $4K).

**Supporting builders building on top of Allo**

**Scaling and growing the Ethereum ecosystem**

*We are taking a page out of Optimism‚Äôs book, and are eager to explore this new structure to further strengthen our program around Gitcoin‚Äôs goals. As we move forward, we will leave room to adjust these as necessary as the program evolves.*

4. **Compliance:**

  * All rounds must comply with [Gitcoin‚Äôs core rules,](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/about-gitcoin/code-of-conduct) which include no fraudulent activity, [no quid pro quo](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-grants/general-questions/what-is-our-quid-pro-quo-policy), hate speech, or other activities out of alignment with Gitcoin‚Äôs essential intents.

5. **Marketing Plan outlined:**

  * All rounds to provide a detailed marketing plan for their round.

### Before the Round

* **Preparation:**
  * Ensure dedicated owners are driving the responsibilities forward. For smaller first-time rounds, these tasks may fall on the experienced Round Operator.
  * Use Gitcoin‚Äôs AI [Checker](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-checker/17292) tool for application reviews and consider building a small team to assist the Round Operator.
  * Form an Advisory Team of committed community stakeholders to help generate ideas, gather feedback, and provide support throughout the round.
  * Go through the [Gitcoin Grants Canvas](https://grantscanvas.gitcoin.co/) to prepare your round with its goals, mission, and design.
  * Familiarize yourself with the [details of operating and running a round](https://roundoperations.gitcoin.co/round-operations) before considering applying.
* **Round Eligibility Document:**
  * Create an eligibility criteria document for project acceptance before fundraising and recruiting grantees to ensure clarity on what qualifies. While this can evolve if needed, the first version should be created before going out and fundraising and recruiting grantees so that it is clear to parties [what is eligible & what isn‚Äôt for the round.](https://roundoperations.gitcoin.co/round-operations/eligibility-and-review/eligibility-process)
* **Mission-Critical Areas:**
  * Allocate or raise funds for the matching pool.
  * Recruit and onboard grantees using guidance from the Gitcoin Grants Stack tools.

### During the Round

* **Marketing:**
  * Promote the round effectively. Reminder: Gitcoin merely supports in marketing efforts during a round. All Community Rounds are responsible for their own outreach/marketing.
* **Compliance:**
  * Undergo KYC if receiving matching funds from Gitcoin. As per Gitcoin‚Äôs policy, any funds +$15k we distribute, parties need to undergo KYC.
* **Support:**
  * Support grantees and donors, with portals, Office Hours, onboarding documentation etc. Note: if needed, Gitcoin may advise.

### After the Round

* **Payouts:**
  * Oversee the payout and KYC process (if required) to ensure smooth facilitation and address any issues.
  * Matching funds must be released within 4 weeks of the round ending; delays may result in ineligibility for future rounds.
  * All payouts must be conducted via Grants Stack, not manually.
* **Retrospective:**
  * Conduct a retrospective to assess what worked and what can be improved, and share feedback with Gitcoin.
* **Ongoing Support:**
  * Continue communication with grantees as needed.

**REMINDER:** This is the minimum for a viable round. [The runbook provided to Round Operators](https://roundoperations.gitcoin.co/round-operations) will include much more information about how to run the best possible round.

            <p>1- Community Rounds are usually hosted by Communities to fund what matters to them by leveraging Gitcoin Grants Stack; based on the GG21 Retrospective, a new category of funding will be created for Round Operators via the Gitcoin Citizens Program.</p>
<p>2- Gitcoin provides training for Operators; today was an Impact Tools focused session.</p>
<p>3- Read below what communities get from Gitcoin besides legitimacy and matching funds.</p>

            <p>I have few practical questions.<br>
1- What‚Äôs the benefit for the teams to run these grants if they must include an experienced paid Round Operator, pay a team, raise at least $5,000 in matching funds, marketing, compliance, and fundraising out of own pocket?<br>
2- How can the teams undergo training if they lack experience? Can a team apply to receive it before hand?<br>
3- Can you specify what kind of support Gitcoin provides before during and after.</p>

<p><strong>Supporting builders building on top of Allo</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scaling and growing the Ethereum ecosystem</strong></p>
<p><em>We are taking a page out of Optimism‚Äôs book, and are eager to explore this new structure to further strengthen our program around Gitcoin‚Äôs goals. As we move forward, we will leave room to adjust these as necessary as the program evolves.</em></p>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Round Eligibility Document:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Create an eligibility criteria document for project acceptance before fundraising and recruiting grantees to ensure clarity on what qualifies. While this can evolve if needed, the first version should be created before going out and fundraising and recruiting grantees so that it is clear to parties <a href="https://roundoperations.gitcoin.co/round-operations/eligibility-and-review/eligibility-process" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">what is eligible &amp; what isn‚Äôt for the round.</a></li>
</ul>
