[Proposal] Ratify the Results of Grants Round 12 and Formally Request the Community Multisig Holders to Payout Matching Allocations

    We ask our Community Stewards to ratify the GR12 payout amounts as being correct, fair, and abiding to community norms, including the judgments and sanctions made by the Fraud Detection & Defense workstream.


We would like to suggest voting on Snapshot to begin on Wednesday, January 5th, in advance of payouts being made the week of January 10th.



# Options to vote on:

**1. Ratify the round results**

You ratify the results as reported by Gitcoin Holdings & the Fraud Detection & Defense workstream and request the keyholders of the community multisig to payout funds according to the GR12 final payout amounts through the non-custodial GR12 deployment contract.


**2. Request further deliberation**

You do not ratify the results and request keyholders of the community multi-sig wallet to delay payment until further notice.


## TLDR from the [Results Post](https://gitcoin.co/blog/gr12-results):

* Grants Round 12 ran from Dec 1-16, 2021

* GR12 was Gitcoin Grantsâ€™ largest round ever with $6.1M raised for public goods, representing 135% round-over-round growth vs. GR11â€™s $2.6M. Of the $6.1M raised in GR12, $3M came from the matching pool and $3.1M came from the community.

* GR12 featured ten rounds:
  * The main round
  * Six ecosystem rounds: Uniswap, Synthetix, ZKTech, Polygon, Forefront, Gitcoin Building Gitcoin (on [dGrants](https://grants.gtcdao.net/)) - *not governed through the community multi-sig*
  * Three cause rounds: Climate, Advocacy, Longevity
* In GR12, we ran an experiment in the main round â€“ having a single pool, rather than a category-based approach. Broadly speaking, this experiment was a success and the Public Goods Funding workstream plans to propose running more single pool rounds in the future.

* In addition, GR12 saw a marked increase in side rounds â€“ both â€˜ecosystem roundsâ€™ and â€˜cause roundsâ€™ â€“ with side round matching funds accounting for double those of the main pool ($2M side rounds + $1M main pool). Weâ€™re excited about continuing on the momentum of these ecosystem & cause rounds in GR13.

We apologize for the delay in posting the full results - we had some issues with our new squelching script that we had to work through.</p>
<p>We will soon be moving this to a Snapshot vote for steward ratification.</p>
