GreenPill Podcast Season 2 - Digital Identity & Sybil Resistance
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/greenpill-podcast-season-2-digital-identity-sybil-resistance/11201
    Hey everyone,

As you may know, I run a podcast called [Greenpill - how crypto can regenerate the world](https://greenpill.party/) on the Bankless network.  

I wanted to let you all know that the podcast is moving into a thematic season about **Digital Identity & Sybil Resistance**, starting Thursday next week.

Guests include: BrightID, Upala, Orca, Bryan Ford, Humannode, Chase Chapman, Ceramic, Disco, GoodDollar/ Spruce, PolygonID, Paula Berman, Idena, GovernorDAO, KYCDAO, WorldCoin, Unique Network, & more

A lot of these guests are possible Gitcoin Passport integrations! More generally, I think that the episodes on digital identity & sybil resistance may be useful to GitcoinDAO as it advances Passport + improves its sybil resistance.  If you are interested in following along, you [may to do so here](https://availableon.com/greenpill).
