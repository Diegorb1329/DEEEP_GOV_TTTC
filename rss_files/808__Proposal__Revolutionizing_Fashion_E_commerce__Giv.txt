            <p>Here are your options imo:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you plan to host a round, work through the Grants Canvas and Round Operator Runbook (both linked in an above comment) to enhance the plan for your round â€“ you can always do this and apply in GG22, which will run end of October.</li>
<li>If you plan to be a grantee yourself, Iâ€™d suggest keeping an eye on other rounds that are running and apply to one of them in GG21!</li>

</aside>
<p>If Iâ€™m understanding correctly, youâ€™re wanting to apply as a grantee in GG21, and not as a Community Round? To participate in GG21 as a Community Round, you need to run a round, where you have a community of grantees that youâ€™re funding that apply to your round.</p>
<p>Also, if you are planning on running a round, using Quadratic Funding for a single grantee is not the best funding mechanism!</p>

            <p>We are applying as a single grantee for this Quadratic Funding round. We aim to provide scholarships for approximately 2,000 students to participate in our blockchain and Web3 education program, normally costing $20 per person.</p>
<p>Our selection process will be as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First, weâ€™ll offer the scholarship opportunity to our existing 1,000 students, giving them priority to apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>weâ€™ll scout for additional external students to fill the remaining scholarship slots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All existing and new, will go through a registration process that includes answering a set of carefully designed questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our team will review these applications and select the best-fit candidates for the scholarships based on their responses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach allows us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reward our current engaged students</li>
<li>Expand our reach to new potential students</li>
<li>Ensure that scholarship recipients are well-suited for the program</li>
</ul>
<p>As the grantee, our team will manage this entire selection process, from promoting the opportunity to making final selections. This method enables us to maintain the quality of our student body while significantly expanding access to our educational program.</p>
<p>We believe this structured approach will maximize the impact of the grant, allowing us to educate a large number of African fashion creators and entrepreneurs in Web3 technologies and blockchain fundamentals.</p>

            <p>I understand. Iâ€™m still unclear, however, how many grantees you are expecting to participate in your round. Would you mind clarifying for me? This is important in order for you to be eligible. If youâ€™re planning on funding 2,000 students in this Quadratic Funding round, how are you going about setting it up? Will each student apply as a grantee?</p>
<p>If you havenâ€™t yet, please take a look at the <a href="https://roundoperations.gitcoin.co/round-operations">Round Operator Runbook</a> linked in the eligibility. Itâ€™s a very useful guide to help you set yourself up for success!</p>

            <p>Our team will oversee the entire selection process, akin to a sponsorship program. Our paid course is priced at a modest $20 per person. Providing this opportunity to selected members will have a significant impact, compared to 2000 students self-funding their participation, which would exceed the requested amount.</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of this initiative and given that this is our inaugural scholarship program for both our members and interested individuals, we are committed to managing the selection process comprehensively from beginning to end. This approach ensures we can carefully curate participants and maximize the programâ€™s effectiveness.</p>

            <p>Hi Mathilda,</p>
<p>I appreciate your prompt response. The grant is intended for the Giva ecosystem to expand our academy and attract more students, including fashion designers, to the blockchain space. Our goal is to bridge the gap between Web2 professionals and the blockchain industry.</p>
<p>Based on our experience, many people remain unfamiliar with this technology. This became evident when our academy offered a free introductory course, which drew significant interest but revealed a widespread lack of understanding among participants. Unfortunately, we couldnâ€™t accommodate all interested students for the intensive training due to the costs associated with maintaining tutors and sessions.</p>
<p>I hope this clarification addresses your questions. Please let me know if you need any further information.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>
