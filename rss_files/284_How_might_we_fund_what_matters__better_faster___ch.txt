    happy new years gitcoin community!

as we enter a new year, with new challenges and new opportunities, i wanted to start a discussion about what the gitcoin community is (or should be) up to in 2025.

my prompt is as follows: **how might we fund what matters (better faster & cheaper) in 2025?**

to break that down
1. **fund what matters** = our mission.  we want to enable communities to discover what matters to them, and then fund it.  i believe the crypto can be a great conduit for the discovery, articulation, and expression of preferences by groups of agents (people, ai agents, etc), and we are progressively discovering, elaborating, and [communicating](https://allobook.gitcoin.co) the design space of how to do that.
2. **better** = doing a better job of reaching that mission.
3. **faster** = doing it faster or with more efficiency.
4. **cheaper** = doing it with less cost (whether financial, time, or other resources)

so what do you think? what should gitcoin prioritize in 2025?  how might we reach this goal?  what can you contribute? **how might we fund what matters (better faster & cheaper) in 2025?**

clearly, this is a very open ended prompt. that is by design!  i have my own vision for answering this prompt that i will be progressively elaborating over the coming weeks and months.  but i wanted to create space for the community to answer the prompt with their own opinions, ideas, GCPs, RFPS, partnership proposals, and visions unencumbered by my own first..

            <p>I found some time to type up a post about how I think about funding what matters better faster cheaper.  In this post, I tried to not be prescriptive about what to do, but instead put forward considerations about how I think about where are now vs where we want to go.   Check it out <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/3-challenges-to-solve-in-2025/19825">here</a>.</p>

            <p>One of my main goals for 2025 is to connect similar projects and protocols that are currently building in isolation. By bringing teams together, we can rapidly create more robust tools, merge the best features from each project, and grow collectively. My role in this process is largely through my stewardship of the Greenpill Dev Guild. After focusing heavily on community building last year, we‚Äôre now well-positioned to facilitate new collaborations between the individuals and groups we‚Äôve worked with. A great example is our current work with Allo and we‚Äôre preparing a proposal alongside other Allo builders, based on the recent forum <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/allo-gitcoin-do-they-make-more-sense-together-or-seperate/19730">post</a>.</p>
<p>In that same vein, GitCoin‚Äôs support of the Allo Builders Advancement last year, especially via matching funds, is exactly the kind of initiative I hope continues. That support helped the Dev Guild connect with new builders, re-energize existing Allo contributors, and increase overall momentum in Allo development.</p>

<h2><a name="regen-coordination-1" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#regen-coordination-1"></a>Regen Coordination</h2>
<p>On a broader level, I believe Regen Coordination can make a massive difference in effectively funding what matters. Similar to how I described connecting isolated projects, uniting communities that are working on similar processes and tools can dramatically speed up community growth, development and reduce costs. Through Regen Coordination, we can align community goals and create the structures that make it easy for builders to work together.</p>
<p>As a member of the Regen Coordination team, we‚Äôve been discussing several ideas for 2025, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a shared regen forum</li>
<li>Hosting workshops</li>
<li>Coordinating more Regen-themed funding rounds on GrantStacks</li>
<li>Aligning impact measurement methods</li>
</ul>
<p>From GitCoin‚Äôs perspective, this could look like more Regen Coordination rounds, joint community calls with GitCoin and Regen Coordination, and collectively designing robust impact measurement frameworks.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="priorities-summary-2" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#priorities-summary-2"></a>Priorities Summary</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Grow community rounds</strong> with a dedicated focus on how these rounds can promote deeper collaboration.</li>
<li><strong>Foster more community-driven Allo governance</strong>, allowing GitCoin to focus on other crucial tooling.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-pollinate with Regen Coordination</strong> to build standardized impact-measurement tooling.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2><a name="challenges-3" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#challenges-3"></a>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Governance &amp; Ownership Structures</strong>: Without clear frameworks and role definitions, collaboration can stall due to conflicting decision-making processes.</li>
<li><strong>Misaligned Incentives</strong>: Different motivations can fracture partnerships unless shared goals and success metrics are established.</li>
<li><strong>Fragmented Funding</strong>:  Ensuring projects and teams have sufficient resources so they can dedicate their full energy to development.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Integration &amp; Compatibility</strong>: Multiple platforms or protocols require early technical reviews and architecture agreement to avoid costly roadblocks.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2><a name="my-contribution-4" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#my-contribution-4"></a>My Contribution</h2>
<p>I bring a wide range of skills, from engineering to community management and have consistently worked to connect initiatives across the space. As Steward of the Greenpill Network and Dev Guild, I‚Äôve gained a well-rounded perspective on product and community development, covering everything from code and community engagement to business development and strategy.</p>
<p>My bandwidth for direct coding has shifted toward software architecture, this transition has positioned me to craft and integrate the architecture for connecting tools. My focus is now on bridging the gaps between similar initiatives at both a technical and team level ensuring they work together effectively.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm incredibly excited about what 2025 holds and look forward to doing my part.<br>
