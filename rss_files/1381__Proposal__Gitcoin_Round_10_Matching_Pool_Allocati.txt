https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gitcoin-round-10-matching-pool-allocations/4988
    # Gitcoin Round 10 Matching Pool Allocations :robot: 

## Summary

This proposal looks to discuss and finalize how funding allocations from the Gitcoin Grants Round 10 Matching Pool are distributed.

## Abstract

The distribution of the Matching Pool to different Grants categories (community, infrastructure, NFTs, etc) has been handled by the **Gitcoin Core team** (rounds 1-5), and later in consultation with the **Funders League** (rounds 6-9). 

With the launch of GTC, this decision should be managed by Gitcoin Stewards (and therefor GTC) who will decide on the best allocation based on community sentiment. 

This process will set a precedent for how future Matching Pools are distributed, and give Gitcoin Stewards more ownership over the ongoing maintenance of Gitcoin Grants.

This proposal also takes into account Vitalik's suggestions to remove categories entirely and distribute the matching pool pro-rata among all grants using Gitcoin's quadratic formula directly. 

## Motivation

As Grants Round 9 saw the highest engagement to date, Gitcoin Stewards should play an active role in the governance and handling of Grants Round 10. 

Taking point on the governance of the Matching Pool allows Stewards and by proxy, the wider community to have a meaningful impact on the allocation of grants, without drastically altering the underlying foundation that has worked so well to date.

In GR9, the $500k GR9 matching pool was allocated as follows:

* Infrastructure: **30%**
* Dapp Tech: **25%**
* Community: **25%**
* East and Southeast Asia Regional: **10%**
* NFTs: **10%**

The above allocations were chosen via an informal governance process from the Gitcoin Core team with feedback from trusted community members and partners. The core motivation was to maintain a fair distribution across the breadth of the space and ensure that the categories were up to date with trends in development at the time. 



## Specification

Through discussion on this proposal and an eventual Snapshot vote, one of the following three options will be selected as the matching pool breakdown for Round 10. 

**Round 10 currently has $650k allocated to matching though that may increase with the addition of new sponsors.**



### Option 1:

**Distribute the matching pool pro-rata relative to the quadratic formula using one bucket and no specified categories.**


### Option 2:

**Distribute the matching pool based on the following breakdown.** These allocations are proposed by the Gitcoin Core team alongside üî•_ üî•.

* Infrastructure: **30%**
* Dapp Tech: **25%**
* Community: **20%**
* Latin America **10%**
* NFTs: **7.5%**
* dGov: **7.5%**

**The goal of this new breakdown offers key aspects:**
1. Retire the SE Asia category to determine if that community can sustain development without regional support.
2. Introduce a new Latin America group to seed development and encourage more globally diverse funding.
3. Introduce a new decentralized governance category to fund projects that enable groups like Gitcoin to adopt tooling and infrastructure which aids progressive decentralization. 

### Option 3:

**Gitcoin Stewards and wider community decide on a new matching breakdown.** We encourage any Steward or community member to submit their own matching pool breakdown! 

Please submit your proposal to the forum over the next week so that the community has sufficient time to vote before the round begins!

## Benefits

- Give GTC governance the power to ratify the direction of matching funds.
- Allow the community to have more ownership over which pools receive the most matching.
- Create a precedent for future matching allocation.

## Drawbacks

- Reduce convenience of distribution in favor of a more decentralized distribution process.



## Vote

Once we have gathered feedback on both this and other proposals, üî•_ üî• will gather all formal proposals and submit a Snapshot vote to decide which to move forward with. 

Please do not submit a snapshot vote for your proposal specifically! This just adds confusion and makes it harder for the community's voice to be heard effectively.

            <p>Option 2 seem more appropriate to me,it ensures that certain aspects of the cryptospace are not neglected. Every aspects need some reasonable attention. A concentration of funds on only a small fragment is not healthy.</p>
