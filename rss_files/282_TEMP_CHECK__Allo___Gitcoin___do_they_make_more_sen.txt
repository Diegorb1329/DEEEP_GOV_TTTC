    # Allo + Gitcoin

## Do they make more sense together or separate?

# TLDR

* Gitcoin focuses on grants and enterprise-first strategies, while Allo targets on-chain capital allocation with a dev-first approach.
* Combining both under one entity creates conflicting priorities and detracts focus, maybe they may be more effective as separate entities.
* Unbundling Allo could foster innovation, partnerships, and ecosystem growth while maintaining collaboration with Gitcoin.
* I want community input here. Do Allo and Gitcoin make more sense together or seperate?

# Introduction

The objective of this post is to compare and contrast the Allo and Gitcoin brands, and to reason about how they work together.

Here is an overview of how I see the brands.

||Gitcoin|Allo|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Focus|Gitcoin = Grants|Allo = Capital Allocation|
|Brand Strength|Very well known in crypto. Not known outside of crypto.|Not yet known very well| |Brand associations|Public goods/regen (previously), now focusing on grants + ecosystem growth|Onchain Capital Allocation, Funding Infrastructure Ideally sophisticated + precise + scalable + sharp funding infra.|
|Organizing Methodology|Enterprise-First|Network-First Dev-First|
|Strategy|B2B SAAS|[Category creation](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/capital-allocation-category-creation-strategy-2024/19256)|
|Focus Market|EVM based ecosystems with $$millions in treasury and a grants program|Any EVM based ecosystem|
|Service Addressable Market|EVM Grants($100m/yr++)|EVM Incentives($100m/y++r),EVM Grants($100m/yr++),DAO Cap allocation($100m/yr++)
|North Star|Gitcoin is a leader in Grants|The capital allocation layer of the tokenized internet|
|History|Founded in 2017 and spend 4 years as a company. Has continually evolved since.|Created as a Gitcoin workstream in 2023|

# Do these things belong together?

First, let us ask.. what value does Allo bring to Gitcoin and visa versa?  

At least in theory, [Open Source Software and Enterprise Development can complement each other.](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/open-source-and-enterprise-development-complement-each-other/19676). This view of the world is expressed below:

[quote="owocki, post:1, topic:19676"]
At Gitcoin, open-source and enterprise software complement each other by combining community-driven innovation with enterprise-level scalability and support.

The open source ecosystem around Allo fosters an emerging ecosystem of tooling, standards, and contributions, enabling rapid development and customization.For enterprise applications, solutions like Grants Stack offer enhanced security, performance, and dedicated services, ensuring that large organizations can leverage the flexibility of open-source software while meeting narrow business requirements.

This synergy allows customers to benefit from the latest advancements while maintaining the robustness required for critical business operations.

# Is it working?

I think the answer is no.  

Why? 
1. I have not been able to get prioritized the Allo Application-layer dev work I wanted in time for Devcon, last quarter. 
2. we've not properly supported Gitcoin ecosystem teams (the blue rows above) in creating as much upside as is possible 
3. I dont think we are moving with sufficient urgency/momentum towards Grants Lab's north star either towards "Become a leader in grants" and Allo's north star of "Become the allocation layer of the tokenized internet" .  There is SOME traction but it is low relate to resource spend IMO.
3. [we built the wrong thing with Allo v1 => v2.1](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/allo-2-1-2-2/19724)
4.  and we're not crushing it on enterprise-development either (though that is trending positively the last 2 quarters since @katalunia @gnomadic joined).  
5. we are still way behind Protocol Guild and Optimism RetroFunding in GMV distributed in 2024.

I think the dysfunction can be summed up as follows: While Allo and Grants are competing priorities within the same business unit, we are not doing either justice. There is a lack of focus that having two north stars can cause. Cobie said it best:

![|363x198](upload://y6KSn9LsFrAae02faA64VuGn9So.png)

Increasingly I find myself wondering if these two things belong together in the same organizing entity. This has got me thinking about what it would mean to unbundle these two brands from one another, and thereby create more value apart vs seperate. As Jim Barksdale said *"You make money by bundling things, and you make money by unbundling them."*

# What would it look like to unbundle these two brands?

About a year ago, we spun out Passport.xyz (formerly Gitcoin Passport).  Passport has been by far our most successful spinout. What if we were on a similar course with Allo?

I think that [Allo and Gitcoin Grants complement each other, at least in theory](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/open-source-and-enterprise-development-complement-each-other/19676). But that doesnt mean that these two entities need to be in the same business unit or even the same DAO.  They can add value to each other from more distance.  They may actually be **more** valuable unbundled. 

This is a phenomenon in math called *supermodularity*. Supermodularity occurs when the combined value of two elements increases when they are used together in close proximity.  The retain more individual value when separate. This synergy enhances their overall benefit, making their combination more valuable than the sum of their standalone contributions.  Two other examples of supermodularity are (1) a restaurant and parking lot or (2) a smartphone and app store -- each gain more value when placed together, as their proximity enhances utility and demand.

Spinning Allo out from Grants Lab into an Allo Lab, or from Gitcoin into its own DAO, i think could open up the following advantages.

1. **Practical Pluralism** - Enable more of a [Practical Pluralism](https://medium.com/@owocki/practical-pluralism-322ab0a984c5) (which we know Vitalik really cares about from his most recent GP episode in Dec 2025) of development teams to build funding infrastructure, by enabling Allo to focus on Network-first, Dev-first, and category creation strategies… 
3. **Create more upside through focus.**  
   - Create more focus by making Allo unencumbered by the roadmap/priorities implications of being in an enterprise-first business unit.
   - Enable each entity to do what it does best - Innovation coming from Allo/Open Source wing of community and enterprise reliability from Grants Lab, [as described here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/open-source-and-enterprise-development-complement-each-other/19676).
   - "The Capital Allocation Layer of the Tokenized Internet" is a big category.  Especially if you believe that "We're going to tokenize everything" in the world as JPDiamond claims.  We should probably properly resource the vehicle that is heading to that north star.
2. **Systematically explore design space** by partnering with other dev teams, perhaps even going partnership-first.. 
   - Put everyone on same footing with Gitcoin Grants Lab. 
   - Systematically explore the design space by distributing governance tokens according to who is generating the most GMV (and GItcoin/Grants Lab has to compete for it in an open market like everyone else)
   - partnership = give Allo/Gitcoin governance tokens or a % of your revenue, in exchagen we give you tech tools, funding, and distribution through GG/Gitcoin.
4. **Launching a fund becomes an option -** I think there is an opportunity to launch a fund that invests in strategic complements to Gitcoin (what [pgDAO](https://gov.gitcoin.co/search?q=pgdao) was meant to be to Gitcoin in the 2022 cycle) 
   - This would allow Allo/Gitcoin to partner more closely with founders/tools not built on Allo. 
   - It would also reduce pressure on the dev teams to solve for EVERY capital allocation tooling category, by allowing us make a build vs buy decision in each category.
   - This could be packaged in an interesting way.  [MSCI has their Emerging Market Latin America fund](https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/5b537e9c-ab98-49e4-88b5-bf0aed926b9b) where trad investors get the benefit of a diversified basket of assets in an up and coming category.   What if we could create a basket of 20 up and coming funding infrastructure projects and mark it as the  ̶M̶S̶C̶I̶ ̶E̶m̶e̶r̶g̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶M̶a̶r̶k̶e̶t̶ ̶L̶a̶t̶i̶n̶ ̶A̶m̶e̶r̶i̶c̶a̶ ̶f̶u̶n̶d̶ Gitcoin Capital Allocation Infrastructure Index (GCAII).
    - Allo/gitcoin has tremendous dealflow of builders/founders building funding infrastructure, which is a tremendous advantage.   They could likely curate a very strong portfolio of these teams. 
    - The Fund is a fundamentally different operating model than Gitcoin has executed to date.
5. **Retain alignment** -  We could still maintain a close working relationship between the two entities [as long as social, economic, and technological alignment is preserved.](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/3-layers-to-a-dao-to-dao-partnership/10657).  In this hypothetical arrangement, teams should be stewards in each others ecosystems.

I’d love to hear the community’s voice on this topic.. My prompts:
1. In what ways is this situation similar or different than Passport.xyz spinout?
2. Did I get the above thinking right or wrong? 
3. What am I missing?
4. What would it mean for Gitcoin and Allo to be a binary star system where both brands exude economic gravity? as opposed to a single star system where only Gitcoin does.   

Please comment below.

            <p>The <a href="https://app.charmverse.io/greenpill-dev-guild" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Greenpill Dev Guild</a> has been actively collaborating with Allo builders in recent weeks to identify synergies and craft a governance proposal for Allo. The proposal focuses on ensuring Allo’s long-term growth and alignment with Gitcoin’s vision by targeting low-risk, high-reward opportunities for GMV growth in both the short term (6 months) and the long term (2-3 years). With an emphasis on capturing GMV after the grant distribution process with internal tooling for payouts recycling GMV.</p>
<p>Stay tune for updates in the coming weeks as we engage with the core Allo team and gather proposal feedback from Gitcoin council members.</p>

            <p>Looking at Gitcoin and Allo’s separation from a practical implementation standpoint raises important considerations about how technology projects succeed in the real world. While both platforms serve important purposes, their separation could actually strengthen each organization’s ability to deliver meaningful solutions.</p>
<p>Gitcoin’s enterprise-first approach requires deep understanding of business processes, compliance requirements, and organizational dynamics. This focus on grants and enterprise strategies aligns well with how established organizations typically adopt and implement new technologies. Their experience since 2017 has given them valuable insights into what enterprises need to successfully integrate blockchain solutions.</p>
<p>On the other side, Allo’s focus on on-chain capital allocation through a dev-first approach represents an important technical innovation. However, technological innovation alone rarely translates directly into successful real-world implementation. The key to bridging this gap often lies in having experienced technical advisers who understand not just the current state of technology, but its historical evolution and practical applications over decades.</p>
<p>The separation of these entities could create space for each to develop more focused advisory relationships. Gitcoin could strengthen its enterprise relationships and implementation expertise, while Allo could benefit from dedicated technical advisers who understand both cutting-edge development and historical patterns of technological adoption.</p>
<p>This kind of specialized guidance becomes particularly crucial when dealing with complex technological implementations. The computing landscape has evolved dramatically over the past four decades, and that evolution has taught us valuable lessons about what makes technology projects succeed or fail in real-world applications. By operating independently, each organization could better incorporate this type of experienced oversight into their development and implementation processes.</p>

            <p>I have read everyone’s comments on both sides of the conversation.</p>
<p>I would support separation of the two products mentioned. As I am not a dev but rather a user of amazing tools, I find more value in using Gitcoin Grants vs Allo. Maybe if capital constrains were not an issue as a founder of a startup my opinion would be different.</p>

<p>GMV = $$$ through the system</p>

<p>GMV correlates with impact, but it is not impact.  our mission is “fund what matters” and so GMV going to “what matters” is the precise thing were working on.</p>

            <p>I’m excited about pushing boundaries with Allo Lab - we should innovate more in this space and I’m committed to making this work.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/jeremy">@Jeremy</a> - your points about lost coordination and BD synergy hit home.  I felt we were just starting to hit some strides and I do miss working with you and the team!

<ul>
<li>Structure regular coordination between Allo and Grants Labs teams</li>
<li>Create handoff processes when Allo experiments show enterprise potential</li>
<li>Share BD/sales resources so both teams benefit from market insights and expertise</li>
<li>Build common infrastructure pieces that serve both experimental and enterprise needs</li>
</ul>
<p>While I’ve raised some operational concerns, I want to be clear about something important: I see <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a> excitement about this in a way I haven’t seen before. When someone with that track record gets energized about something, we should lean in and help make it work.</p>
<p>The challenges I’ve raised are real, but they’re problems to solve, not roadblocks. Kevin’s vision and enthusiasm for this should be enough for us to say “let’s figure this out” rather than “here’s why it won’t work.”</p>

            <p>I can see both sides of this. So let me steelman each.</p>
<p><strong>The case against doing it</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Talent flight. From my experience at Protocol Labs during “<a href="https://www.protocol.ai/blog/pl-past-present-future/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">nucleation</a>”, spinning out pre-revenue teams often leads to attrition. Top talent that joined a relatively stable (<img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=12" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">) well known brand may not stick around for a high-uncertainty startup phase. If they wanted that life, they could start their own thing.</li>
<li>Failure to find PMF. Neither Grants Lab nor Allo currently has a proven revenue model (see <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/6/6655d6d817adb7f5c5aea53a65d18afad35d4d76.png">above scorecard</a>). Allo could become another underutilized DAO tool, while Grants Lab risks becoming an ops-heavy dev shop for experimental grant programs.</li>
<li>Lost synergy. Today, Gitcoin’s grants benefit from controlling the funding rails, and Allo’s product improves from Gitcoin’s market insights. Unbundling would remove this feedback loop. Allo’s dev-first approach would be different from Gitcoin’s enterprise focus, and Gitcoin doesn’t have a track record of selling directly to devs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The case for doing it</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Agility.  Smaller, separate teams can move faster and prioritize their core missions without the baggage of competing internal interests. If one sinks, it doesn’t drag the other down.</li>
<li>Finding better partners. As long as Allo remains under Gitcoin, it’s overshadowed by Grants’ requirements. Independence forces Allo to find the right customers and gives Grants freedom to choose better partners too. As <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/jeremy">@Jeremy</a> mentioned, Passport is a good example of how this can play out – it found better customers than Gitcoin; and Gitcoin found better collusion resistance than Passport.</li>
<li>Business model flexibility. Without shared overhead, Grants can compete more aggressively for partnerships. Allo could explore new business models (independent of Gitcoin’s enterprise strategy) or token models (independent of GTC).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to choose?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ulimately, these things come down to the people leading each entity. Ignoring sunk costs but knowing what you know about the people, would you bet on them independently to make a go at it?</li>
<li>If the answer is yes, then the expected value of a split if probably higher than keeping them together.</li>

<p>Hi Jeremy, good to see you.  Thx for stopping by and the comment!  <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/saluting_face.png?v=12" title=":saluting_face:" class="emoji" alt=":saluting_face:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>I consider Passport spinout to by far the best executed spin-outs in the Gitcoin ecosystem.  You didnt steal any IP or assets (I know this is a low bar, but believe it or not it’s happened before), you negotiated the spinout forthright, executed it cleanly, and you seem to be on a path to success in your post-Gitcoin era. Maybe one day Gitcoin’s stake in Passport will even return some capital to Gitcoin <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>All of these things should be a precedent set that informs further spinouts IMO (Allo or otherwise)</p>

            <p>The spin out of Passport has been positive sum for both Gitcoin DAO and Passport XYZ.</p>
<p>On the negative side:</p>
<ul>
<li>we’ve lost some coordination by not being together throughout the day to day</li>
<li>there is likely more BD synergy we could have captured by having the teams together and more coordinated in market</li>
</ul>
<p>but that is far outweighed by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Passport focus - This was a huge win for us to be able to focus ALL of our efforts and meetings on growing Passport.</li>
<li>Gitcoin focus -  our spinout freed up mindshare for Gitcoin as we were always a bit orthogonal to the main strategy and vision</li>
<li>Support - reduced support on Gitcoin side for Passports large consumer base</li>
<li>Monetization and value capture options that might not have been present within the DAO</li>
</ul>

            <p>Coming from the other side of the equation as a buyer of services, interface customization, and allocation infrastructure, I see differing incentives between Grants Lab and Allo protocol.</p>
<p>Allo protocol should want Arbitrum to use their protocol to the point of building custom interfaces that are exactly what Arbitrum desires. This isn’t the best decision for Grants Lab which needs to be a sustainable business. My thesis is that GTC should govern an impact network that has investment in many centralized and decentralized organizations including Grants Lab and an Allo DAO. The Gitcoin Impact network should benefit from Grants Labs revenue and Allo protocol adoption. Its role is to rebalance incentives between the collaborating self-interested entities. (Per Ostrom’s SES Framework)</p>

<p>Even though the original post doesn’t consider the Gitcoin Impact Network (GTC) separation from Grants Lab, I will approach this in a way that works for that situation or the binary star idea.</p>
<p>Here are a few things that are true of Allo protocol selfish desires, but not for Grants Lab:</p>
<h3><a name="allo-protocol-optimal-strategy-1" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#allo-protocol-optimal-strategy-1"></a>Allo protocol optimal strategy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don’t charge a service provider fee for the interface customization or service consulting. Do this free to get adoption such that the adopting ecosystem will begin building modules for scaling grant eligibility reviews, post grant impact analysis, etc. When the ecosystem is sold on using Allo for everything, then refer them to Grants Lab to customize a high quality interface.</li>
<li>Don’t position yourself as a competitor to other service providers. Disconnect from any messaging about offering consulting and interface customization services. You don’t want to be seen as a competitor to other consulting services or interfaces. If these other service providers see Allo as Gitcoin - and they see Gitcoin offering services - they will become an impediment to every potential deal for Allo protocol. They will want their fair chance. Additionally, they won’t become partners who recommend your protocol in every other deployment they win. Sure, they might collaborate for a round or two, but they won’t deeply integrate and they will always think you are coming for their lunch! This is why Grants Lab, not Gitcoin, should offer services.</li>
<li>Optimize for a postive feedback loop between the action Allo protocol incentivizes (Likely as a DAO with an ongoing issuance a la BTC or ETH) and the value of ALLO.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Gitcoin focuses on grants and enterprise-first strategies, while Allo targets on-chain capital allocation with a dev-first approach.</li>
<li>Combining both under one entity creates conflicting priorities and detracts focus, maybe they may be more effective as separate entities.</li>
<li>Unbundling Allo could foster innovation, partnerships, and ecosystem growth while maintaining collaboration with Gitcoin.</li>

<p>First, let us ask… what value does Allo bring to Gitcoin and visa versa?</p>
<p>At least in theory, <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/open-source-and-enterprise-development-complement-each-other/19676">Open Source Software and Enterprise Development can complement each other.</a>. This view of the world is expressed below:</p>

<p>At Gitcoin, open-source and enterprise software complement each other by combining community-driven innovation with enterprise-level scalability and support.</p>
<p>The open source ecosystem around Allo fosters an emerging ecosystem of tooling, standards, and contributions, enabling rapid development and customization.For enterprise applications, solutions like Grants Stack offer enhanced security, performance, and dedicated services, ensuring that large organizations can leverage the flexibility of open-source software while meeting narrow business requirements.</p>
<p>This synergy allows customers to benefit from the latest advancements while maintaining the robustness required for critical business operations.</p>

<h1><a name="is-it-working-6" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#is-it-working-6"></a>Is it working?</h1>
<p>I think the answer is no.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<ol>
<li>I have not been able to get prioritized the Allo Application-layer dev work I wanted in time for Devcon, last quarter.</li>
<li>we’ve not properly supported Gitcoin ecosystem teams (the blue rows above) in creating as much upside as is possible</li>
<li>I dont think we are moving with sufficient urgency/momentum towards Grants Lab’s north star either towards “Become a leader in grants” and Allo’s north star of “Become the allocation layer of the tokenized internet” .  There is SOME traction but it is low relate to resource spend IMO.</li>
<li><a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/allo-2-1-2-2/19724">we built the wrong thing with Allo v1 =&gt; v2.1</a></li>
<li>and we’re not crushing it on enterprise-development either (though that is trending positively the last 2 quarters since <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/katalunia">@katalunia</a> <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/gnomadic">@gnomadic</a> joined).</li>
<li>we are still way behind Protocol Guild and Optimism RetroFunding in GMV distributed in 2024.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the dysfunction can be summed up as follows: While Allo and Grants are competing priorities within the same business unit, we are not doing either justice. There is a lack of focus that having two north stars can cause. Cobie said it best:</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/e/ef0d6ca2bcc5828cfbda6d1017de8a122c9269b8.png" data-download-href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/ef0d6ca2bcc5828cfbda6d1017de8a122c9269b8" title=""><img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/e/ef0d6ca2bcc5828cfbda6d1017de8a122c9269b8_2_363x198.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="y6KSn9LsFrAae02faA64VuGn9So" width="363" height="198" role="presentation" srcset="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/e/ef0d6ca2bcc5828cfbda6d1017de8a122c9269b8_2_363x198.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/e/ef0d6ca2bcc5828cfbda6d1017de8a122c9269b8_2_544x297.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/e/ef0d6ca2bcc5828cfbda6d1017de8a122c9269b8_2_726x396.png 2x" data-dominant-color="080808"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Increasingly I find myself wondering if these two things belong together in the same organizing entity. This has got me thinking about what it would mean to unbundle these two brands from one another, and thereby create more value apart vs seperate. As Jim Barksdale said <em>“You make money by bundling things, and you make money by unbundling them.”</em></p>
<h1><a name="what-would-it-look-like-to-unbundle-these-two-brands-7" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#what-would-it-look-like-to-unbundle-these-two-brands-7"></a>What would it look like to unbundle these two brands?</h1>
<p>About a year ago, we spun out Passport.xyz (formerly Gitcoin Passport).  Passport has been by far our most successful spinout. What if we were on a similar course with Allo?</p>
<p>I think that <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/open-source-and-enterprise-development-complement-each-other/19676">Allo and Gitcoin Grants complement each other, at least in theory</a>. But that doesnt mean that these two entities need to be in the same business unit or even the same DAO.  They can add value to each other from more distance.  They may actually be <strong>more</strong> valuable unbundled.</p>
<p>This is a phenomenon in math called <em>supermodularity</em>. Supermodularity occurs when the combined value of two elements increases when they are used together in close proximity.  The retain more individual value when separate. This synergy enhances their overall benefit, making their combination more valuable than the sum of their standalone contributions.  Two other examples of supermodularity are (1) a restaurant and parking lot or (2) a smartphone and app store – each gain more value when placed together, as their proximity enhances utility and demand.</p>
<p>Spinning Allo out from Grants Lab into an Allo Lab, or from Gitcoin into its own DAO, i think could open up the following advantages.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Practical Pluralism</strong> - Enable more of a <a href="https://medium.com/@owocki/practical-pluralism-322ab0a984c5">Practical Pluralism</a> (which we know Vitalik really cares about from his most recent GP episode in Dec 2025) of development teams to build funding infrastructure, by enabling Allo to focus on Network-first, Dev-first, and category creation strategies…</li>
<li><strong>Create more upside through focus.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Create more focus by making Allo unencumbered by the roadmap/priorities implications of being in an enterprise-first business unit.</li>
<li>Enable each entity to do what it does best - Innovation coming from Allo/Open Source wing of community and enterprise reliability from Grants Lab, <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/open-source-and-enterprise-development-complement-each-other/19676">as described here</a>.</li>
<li>“The Capital Allocation Layer of the Tokenized Internet” is a big category.  Especially if you believe that “We’re going to tokenize everything” in the world as JPDiamond claims.  We should probably properly resource the vehicle that is heading to that north star.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Systematically explore design space</strong> by partnering with other dev teams, perhaps even going partnership-first…
<ul>
<li>Put everyone on same footing with Gitcoin Grants Lab.</li>
<li>Systematically explore the design space by distributing governance tokens according to who is generating the most GMV (and GItcoin/Grants Lab has to compete for it in an open market like everyone else)</li>
<li>partnership = give Allo/Gitcoin governance tokens or a % of your revenue, in exchagen we give you tech tools, funding, and distribution through GG/Gitcoin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Launching a fund becomes an option -</strong> I think there is an opportunity to launch a fund that invests in strategic complements to Gitcoin (what <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/search?q=pgdao">pgDAO</a> was meant to be to Gitcoin in the 2022 cycle)
<ul>
<li>This would allow Allo/Gitcoin to partner more closely with founders/tools not built on Allo.</li>
<li>It would also reduce pressure on the dev teams to solve for EVERY capital allocation tooling category, by allowing us make a build vs buy decision in each category.</li>
<li>This could be packaged in an interesting way.  <a href="https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/5b537e9c-ab98-49e4-88b5-bf0aed926b9b">MSCI has their Emerging Market Latin America fund</a> where trad investors get the benefit of a diversified basket of assets in an up and coming category.   What if we could create a basket of 20 up and coming funding infrastructure projects and mark it as the  ̶M̶S̶C̶I̶ ̶E̶m̶e̶r̶g̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶M̶a̶r̶k̶e̶t̶ ̶L̶a̶t̶i̶n̶ ̶A̶m̶e̶r̶i̶c̶a̶ ̶f̶u̶n̶d̶ Gitcoin Capital Allocation Infrastructure Index (GCAII).</li>
<li>Allo/gitcoin has tremendous dealflow of builders/founders building funding infrastructure, which is a tremendous advantage.   They could likely curate a very strong portfolio of these teams.</li>
<li>The Fund is a fundamentally different operating model than Gitcoin has executed to date.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Retain alignment</strong> -  We could still maintain a close working relationship between the two entities <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/3-layers-to-a-dao-to-dao-partnership/10657">as long as social, economic, and technological alignment is preserved.</a>.  In this hypothetical arrangement, teams should be stewards in each others ecosystems.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’d love to hear the community’s voice on this topic… My prompts:</p>
<ol>
<li>In what ways is this situation similar or different than Passport.xyz spinout?</li>
<li>Did I get the above thinking right or wrong?</li>
<li>What am I missing?</li>
<li>What would it mean for Gitcoin and Allo to be a binary star system where both brands exude economic gravity? as opposed to a single star system where only Gitcoin does.</li>
</ol>
