https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gcp-xxx-gitcoin-partnerships-council/16274
    Gitcoin just like the Ethereum ecosystem has always been a work in progress. Starting as a simple idea to help open source developers get paid, it's evolved (as we all know) into a global movement around how community-first funding can and should be done.

Along this journey there have always been helpers and critics who have fought to make us better; who have worked to help us fine tune our mission, our products, and ultimately create forms of impact that echo far beyond just "crypto".

Although I have stepped away from the DAO the past year I have always tried to emphasize that we need to continue listening to these key community members -- our grantees, donors, and funders --  because it is through their efforts that we are able to compound our own. 

Unfortunately, I do not believe we are effectively listening anymore.

As an organization that prides itself on [impact](https://impact.gitcoin.co/) we will always have to make trade-offs and walk the fine line of getting funding to those that need it while staying true to our principles. This is not and has never been an easy task (and I really do know it). But to be a DAO it is imperative that the **we** that is making these choices is our community and that **we** are taking these steps together.

The current stewards council is a step in this direction, giving voices to those the DAO has chosen to represent its interests. The problem is that this council does not have a say in some of the most important decisions we make around the kinds of partners we support.

Needless to say, some of our partner choices have sparked some controversy in the community:

https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1691259752230313986

https://twitter.com/hudsonjameson/status/1691242732474314753

https://twitter.com/basedkarbon/status/1691119545627369472

https://twitter.com/scupytrooples/status/1691109210564730880

https://twitter.com/LefterisJP/status/1691118667071627264

https://twitter.com/ViktorBunin/status/1691451389174775811

And the list goes on.

The backlash here was not unpredictable, in fact, as others have stated:

> We knew this announcement would ruffle feathers, but I really see it as an opportunity for us to push this conversation forward.

And herein lies the problem. In the Ethereum ecosystem, in community-first organizations, we have the superpower of clairvoyance. We can know what the community's reaction to something might be because we can ask them. We should take advantage of this fact more often and **regardless of how we feel about an individual partner** we should get their feedback.

I recognize that we are moving to a permissionless world where anyone can use our protocols, and when we get there this may no longer be an issue. But so long as we have a program and so long as we are putting partners next to our brand we need to understand the consequences. 

To this end, I'd like to propose the creation of a partnerships council which reviews and reserves the right to veto partners so long as they are contributing to a Gitcoin branded round. This council would be composed of a number of key opinion leaders in the Ethereum ecosystem who can help us avoid backlash in the future and rally what is unfortunately today an increasingly disenchanted base of true believers. None of this would restrict our current work towards building permissionless, open tooling that anyone can use like [allo](https://twitter.com/alloprotocol).

If this proposal passes, I would be solely responsible for putting together an initial short-list of 20 prospective council members, 7 of which could then be quadratically voted in through a separate Snapshot vote.

There is a much more nuanced conversation to be had on any particular partner, but at the very least I believe that is a conversation that should be had at the point in time that there is a meaningful decision to be made, not after the fact on social media.

To emphasize, **since I am no longer active, I recognize this is not my choice to make but yours**. I hope now and always you will strive to make ones where the community is first. 

Public goods are good. :pray:

<p>We need pre-defined guardrails to guide our decision making. We don‚Äôt have a codified purpose, vision or values to drive decision-making for the program.

<p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/viriya">@Viriya</a> thank you for mentioning this, and driving it forward.  I know you attempted to build these guardrails in the past in an attempt to anticipate issues like ‚Äúwhat do we do if (insert whatever-group-makes-you-choke-here) wants to run a round?‚Äù and related issues, but but those efforts died due to lack of interest/priority.</p>
<p>I understand the reluctance for the org to do this kind of work.  This is hard, it is not on any WS season seasonal plans, it does not hit any of the top priorities, and there was no support for those who championed work that might have prevented this.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, Gitcoin insiders may not have the capacity/breadth/foresight to prioritize this kind of work, or the stamina to see it through once the headlines fade.</p>
<p>I might humbly suggest you take this outside of CSDO to a group of highly capable and externally focused leaders (who have been appointed/elected), and asked for their help to avoid such issues. We know where the landmines are, we just need to someone to prioritize routing around them out BEFORE Gitcoin steps on the next one.</p>

            <p>I am from the ‚Äúnew guard‚Äù and also 100% against this‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt agree with the narrative of ‚ÄúLets focus on how processes can be improved‚Äù.<br>
This was knowingly pushed through, because you know that any vote would have lost,<br>
and you wanted to get the money first and deal with any consequences later.</p>
<p>Yes we have to improve processes but first THIS situation has to be dealt with, put it to a vote and kick Shell out to save the Gitcoin brand.</p>

            <p>I think the reason the old guard‚Ñ¢ is becoming less engaged and more openly critical is because they have provided a lot of feedback that they don‚Äôt feel has been implemented; they don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôve been heard (in some cases over years). At the end of the day we don‚Äôt necessarily have to agree with them on everything, but just engage with them ‚Äì not just through a brand and public statements but consistently and earnestly as individuals. I think over time this will go a long way.</p>
<p>I see a lot of camaraderie in the team (and camaraderie is great) in various channels after this event ‚Äì people talking about how we can‚Äôt be fighting with each other and need to work together against a harsh outside world. But if we believe in this distinction and view the people making these statements as enemies rather than allies we are doing ourselves a disservice and creating even more distance between ourselves and an Ethereum community that is fighting a greater battle against a larger, harsher outside world.</p>
<p>Anyway, I‚Äôll leave space for others to continue the discussion on potential paths forward, I‚Äôm really glad to see how productive the discussion has been so far. Really appreciate all of you, both for what you‚Äôre doing here and as individual people. <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/pray.png?v=12" title=":pray:" class="emoji" alt=":pray:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p>Thanks for this ‚Äì and agree this is exactly the type of relationship I‚Äôd like to see between the old and new guard. The reality is that the old guard is becoming less engaged in governance and more openly critical of gitcoin‚Äôs missteps. How do you swing the pendulum back in the other direction? and when there are hard choices that come down to values / strategy, you‚Äôre able to make them in a way that the both sides respect?</p>
<p>(And also agree this convo is way too deep in a gov thread to be impactful <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/laughing.png?v=12" title=":laughing:" class="emoji" alt=":laughing:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">)</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ccerv1">@ccerv1</a> I worry about going too deep on this given the length of the thread so I‚Äôm sorry in advance, but I do think the idea of choosing between the old guard and new frontiers is worth addressing.</p>
<p><strong>The Business Blockchain‚Ñ¢.</strong> The first point that‚Äôs important to remember is that each cycle there is a surge of interest from mainstream organizations, many of which the old guard were <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/consensys-acquires-quorum-platform-from-jp-morgan/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">active</a> <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/blockchain-technology-goes-mainstream/3873538.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">participants</a> <a href="https://www.santander.com/en/press-room/press-releases/santander-launches-the-first-end-to-end-blockchain-bond" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">in working</a> with. Almost every large fortune 500 you can imagine has been pitched on and in many cases implemented blockchain related prototypes and trials often through specialized teams.</p>
<p>The prior interest from fortune 500s is in a way good news: it means that people see the value of Ethereum and the value of the technology being built here. The bad news is that chasing down many of these organizations is like <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-true-life-horror-that-inspired-moby-dick-17576/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">hunting whales</a>, and <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/library/3O-why-big-deals-are-bad-for-startups" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">hunting whales</a> is not an easy task ‚Äì many organizations like Coinbase, ConsenSys, or the Ethereum Foundation have seen this in their own way. Eventually, I genuinely believe we will be able to bring all of these organizations on board. But it won‚Äôt be in a vacuum, and it won‚Äôt be overnight, it will be an effort that takes (and has taken) the entire Ethereum community. Maybe rather than cutting ties there is an opportunity to <a href="https://consensys.net/blockchain-use-cases/energy-and-sustainability/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">remind them of this</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Core and Periphery.</strong> The old guard a kind of first boss: they are crypto-native, and they can and will use tools that help make their digital homestead better because they truly believe in it. But for the average person, crypto is hard, and the process of new networks and bridges doesn‚Äôt necessarily make it easier. We should strive to build for those new to the space, but it will always be a longer and harder fought battle ‚Äì one that perfecting our work with the old guard can help us and other Ethereum-based projects fight. This is the most business-y thing I‚Äôll say here, but to be explicit <a href="https://www.reforge.com/blog/retention-engagement-growth-silent-killer" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">compounding effects don‚Äôt occur from new acquisition but from retention</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration Across Difference.</strong> Finally, and this is more of a philosophical point: Gitcoin is fundamentally building open permissionless tools for coordination; for cooperation across difference. That on its own requires a kind of credible neutrality, which is what Viktor is criticizing <a href="https://twitter.com/ViktorBunin/status/1691451389174775811" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a>. But that also means we have to avoid picking favorites when we choose who to promote, even when we move towards a new frontier.</p>
<p>For what it‚Äôs worth, I do think it‚Äôs worth noting that people will always have different views, and that there will be times that we have to choose between those views. I don‚Äôt, however, think there‚Äôs a world where we succeed without the Ethereum community.</p>
<p>If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.</p>

            <p>There seems to be convergence around the idea of polling the community / getting buy-in earlier in the process. Sounds great in principle, but who are we actually talking about?</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/m0nkeyfl0wer">@M0nkeyFl0wer</a> is spot on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do we even define ‚Äúthe community‚Äù given we have a wide range of different communities using our tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôll take a wager at this. There are two types of communities (not mutually exclusive collectively exhaustive yada yada) but distinct enough to hopefully make my point:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There‚Äôs an old guard that has been with Gitcoin since the last bear market, is highly influential on CT + in crypto funding circles, has lots of context / experience, holds big bags of GTC, doesn‚Äôt rely much if at all on Gitcoin Grants for funding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And there‚Äôs a new guard that came more recently, bring experience and legitimacy mostly from non-crypto domains, hold little or no GTC, see Gitcoin Grants as an important income stream</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who is Gitcoin building for?</strong> Is it the community who was critical in the early days? Or the newer ones that are just getting settled or haven‚Äôt even arrived yet?</p>
<p>If the answer is ‚Äúboth‚Äù or ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù, then it‚Äôs not working. The early community is not active in governance anymore ‚Äì and the newer communities don‚Äôt have any voting power. All the talk about decentralization completely misses the point if you‚Äôre not explicitly building for the people you want to feel like owners.</p>
<p>Both paths are honorable. Both paths have their land mines. But pick a path and be proud of it.</p>

<p>Couldn‚Äôt agree more. For (the many) people who are still not part of our inner world here at Gitcoin+QF, this partnership actually struts ‚Äòreal world‚Äô legitimacy.</p>
<p>‚ÄòSteal from the rich, give to the poor.‚Äô</p>
<p>But in this case the rich are just giving us this award, so what are we to do, simply not make it available to our grantees (to choose / not choose the matching funds)?<br>

            <p>I‚Äôve been working with The Nature Conservancy for almost four years. As their APAC leadership council member, I need to work with these types of controversies and companies ALL the time. so wanted to assure everyone that it is normal process we need to work our way through when it comes to important but controversial topic of climate change. It is a difficult conversation, but that‚Äôs every international organization, NGOs have to deal with in a nuanced, thoughtful, practically effective but also non-triggering manner.</p>
<p>Therefore, I agree with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/umarkhaneth">@umarkhaneth</a> on a simple temperature check with the community to gauge the potential repercussions when the collaboration comes out, and agree with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle">@kyle</a> on having the basic ESG principles listed as selecting the sponsors.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, for controversial topics like this, it is not something that can be solved by one community. Political elections play around this narrative all the time and fights ensue. As a decentralized, open-source and technology-driven community, I urge us to think if we actually want to exclude the so-called ‚Äúbad actors‚Äù in the game and opt for the safe easy route of not instigating any public rages. This could well be an opportunity to advocate for both the power of Gitcoin products/QF to make unfair things fairer, and how QF is leveling out the playing field.</p>
<p>Some interesting food for thoughts, as the newly elected steward council member who‚Äôs based in Asia, I do notice some differences in terms of how this news is perceived elsewhere. Two themes that arise from Asian audience‚Äôs response:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gitcoin is leading the RWA narrative, and more real life use cases are showing up</li>
<li>merge of web3 and ‚Äúreal‚Äù world</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, there‚Äôre some cultural differences here as ‚Äúgreenwashing‚Äù is not so much an instilled concept in people‚Äôs minds, and practicality probably dominates much of the thinking process. It‚Äôs food for thoughts as in there are a lot of audience other than our usual audience on Twitter, who view this as an opportunity (btw, Linkedin reaction is also in a whole different world). Therefore, I agree that the way it conveys on Twitter can be double checked and more sensitive to the potential backlash.</p>
<p>Lastly, just my two cents of working in sustainability at an organization for quite some time. What follows after this partnership is ultra-important. And it will affect Gitcoin branding if no proper disclosure of fund allocation, continued support for the projects involved in Shell‚Äôs round, impact reporting from Shell, more commitment from both sides for fuller disclosure. If done well, it will show a monumental step against so-called ‚Äúgreen-washing‚Äù from both Shell‚Äôs perspective, and our response to the community.</p>

            <p>True, I did sign off on the document but I think there was some miscommunication about what else we could and should say. I never said we could not add our own context or explanation beyond what was in those documents and I also pushed back on everything that felt like greenwashing in our discussions about how to handle this partnership overall.</p>
<p>To be clear I don‚Äôt think anyone from MMM is to blame for this situation. Its largely the result of the contrast between building in public and the realities of trying to make a deal with any large company.</p>
<p>To me the bigger issues are systemic. How do we ensure that the communities vision of what is an appropriate partner for the rounds we run is reflected. How do we even define ‚Äúthe community‚Äù given we have a wide range of different communities using our tools.</p>
<p>Its really awful to see so many people upset about this. Its also really great to see how much people care about Gitcoin and about climate change and justice.</p>
<p>Lets focus on how processes can be improved instead of pointing fingers at each other.</p>

            <p>The optics of the Shell play appear to be more inflammatory than the underlying mechanics; <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle">@kyle</a> has outlined the thought process which is worth a read. Contentious decisions will rarely please everyone, so I concur with temp-check polls proposed by <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/umarkhaneth">@umarkhaneth</a>. This way, we can better promote a favorable perception of the narrative as it aligns with the community‚Äôs values.</p>

            <p>I can‚Äôt find where I saw it but one simple and effective proposal is to use more polls to gauge community opinion. Then more controversial topics could always turn into governance proposals. But if it‚Äôs not controversial (like the vast majority of our partnerships) there‚Äôs no need to put red tape over it or centralize power.</p>

            <p>One idea that comes to mind, perhaps we have sponsors listed as part of the eligibility criteria vote for the round. ie, we ratify eligibility criteria, and we also ratify sponsors who we market. Timing can be tricky as we usually have been working on raising funds for weeks in advance, but marketing we commit to with the partner can evolve.</p>
<p>Doing something any more complex seems out of line at this stage and will just add more red tape to a string of work that the community largely has never cared about.</p>

            <p>If we devise a mechanism to reflect the bottom-up preferences of the community in forming new partnerships, I propose that the voices in the community who have the most skin in the game in the context of the partnership should have disproportionately stronger weight over the rest.</p>
<p>Case in point - if we had a similar mechanism in place for a decision regarding Shell, the point-of-views of the grantees in the Climate Round should weigh over most other things. They are closest to the reality on the ground for what it takes to move a needle at a local level. Whether it is Lahaina in Hawaii or Shimla in the Himalayas, when nature strikes its fury, it doesn‚Äôt discriminate based on what beliefs we hold dear. On the contrary, the most vulnerable indigenous population, who had little to do with what‚Äôs happening with our climate and may not have the luxury of embracing ideologies that I might, are the most impacted.</p>
<p>As someone who has nothing to do with the Climate round, I might hold my opinion dear on the trail of bad blood in the money going in the pool, but it shouldn‚Äôt count as much as, say, a grantee from the Global South fighting for the next dollar that can go a long way in making a difference in their world. Alternatively, if the grantee community believes their rounds are better off without similar alliances, the DAO should honor that as a signal in future partnerships.</p>

            <p>As I am not longer involved in governance at Gitcoin, I feel free to share my opinions openly.   Also, given I worked with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation">@ceresstation</a> to attempt turn his vision for the Steward Council into reality, I do possess a bit of insight as to how this circumstance could have been mitigated using the existing body.</p>
<p><strong>Gitcoin does not need another council - it just needs to use tools it has</strong><br>
The steward council was created to bring outside perspectives into Gitcoin.  The issue is, although (most) Steward Council members dutifully showed up every couple weeks, Gitcoin workstream leaders could have done a much better job engaging in their expertise, insight and advocacy by bringing real topics to the council.  Feel free to have a look, but aside from MMM and DAO Ops, I don‚Äôt recall many topics brough to the council from the other workstreams.</p>
<p>The Steward Council is a mechanism designed to keep Gitcoin out of this kind of situation - by avoiding it, or building broader advocacy prior to release.</p>
<p><strong>Gitcoin does not need more centralization - it just needs to use tools it has</strong><br>
The steward council has no hard power by design. If you want the council to have hard power, pull your delegation from Gitcoin insiders (btw helps decentralize) and delegate to those workstreams-nominated, tokenholder-elected individuals.</p>

            <p>I‚Äôm engaging on the forum for the first time in a bit with a couple things to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Critically:</strong> I also don‚Äôt want us to get trapped in ‚Äúexactly what process we should put forward here‚Äù which is why I suggested the minimum viable path. We need something simple that allows relevant voices like Hudson / Lefteris / others above (who have done a lot for us historically) to learn about and engage on what is happening before it‚Äôs on Twitter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation">@ceresstation</a> is spot on here. The DAO needs mechanisms to communicate with the delegates/community that are not the chaotic forums or Discord ‚Äî I pop back in every so often and, even with this post, get so overwhelmed by the quantity of posts &amp; replies that it is really, really hard to tell what‚Äôs going on &amp; what‚Äôs important right now vs. what‚Äôs noise.</p>
<p>I tweeted about this earlier after spending a bunch of time thinking about the situation, and I‚Äôll reiterate my two points here ‚Äî I think the DAO needs to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Define Governance Surface Area - if it‚Äôs made clear what gets decided on by whom, even in broad strokes, things will get much easier. Simple constructs like the council proposed here may help, but I think a lot of it can even be defined by just articulating what‚Äôs happening today and codifying it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engage Stewards - I initially said something along the lines of Steward Engagement in my tweet, but I actually think it‚Äôs bigger than that: it‚Äôs crisply communicate what‚Äôs going on and what‚Äôs most important at the top-line DAO level, not at the workstream level or at the team level. In current state, I have found it really hard as an external steward to get cohesive context, and I want to contribute but it‚Äôs not always abundantly clear where to step in without having a unified view of the overall picture.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the long run, challenges like this will make the DAO better ‚Äî these will likely be looked back on as having been important growing pains for Gitcoin, and will set precedent for other decentralized communities to learn from. Appreciate you all.</p>

            <p>Thanks all for the engagement on this so far I appreciate the discussion. Addressing a few of the key points I see so far:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>deals with enterprises of this nature take months, if not years. there‚Äôs usually one or more champions on the inside of the company pushing it through and lots of diligence done on the partner (gitcoin in this case). imho, i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs feasible to go through that kind of a process only to reveal at the end, ‚Äúnow we‚Äôre going to have our community vet you and they might choose not to accept your money‚Äù.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firstly, I definitely agree with this and I‚Äôve experienced first-hand the challenges with these processes as with the original UNICEF deal which took over a year to finalize. I think defining a framework rather than structuring a committee that vetos one-off partnerships is probably better and I would support that approach, so long as the strategy around this is defined and visible in advance of decisions. TL;DR, echoing <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/viriya">@Viriya</a>, maybe there‚Äôs a way to do this without a committee as well and just with pre-defined guardrails.</p>
<p>That said, I also strongly resonate with what <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/krrisis">@krrisis</a> said here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The featured rounds can show the power of Gitcoin Grants Stack and just as important: they <strong>can and should be the embodiment of what the OG web3 community believes in</strong> . They should focus on the themes we started out with, open source being for many reasons at the heart of this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And would just stress again that any approach we take should consider the history Gitcoin has been built on and listen to the voices of some of the core Ethereum community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the concern about this particular partnership was brought up within our community - by someone working for the DAO - a very long time ago and yet we did not react. this to me feels no only a failure to ‚Äúlisten to the community‚Äù but a shared failure to hear each other and a collective lack of coordination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/alexalombardo">@alexalombardo</a> to your point and to <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/connor">@connor</a> yours I alongside others (including you at times) have spoken up about controversial partnerships in the past and tried to emphasize (alongside <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a>) legitimacy as <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-does-the-dao-prioritize-side-rounds/9827/3">a key measure</a> of a partner‚Äôs potential. At one point I even (privately) rank ordered partners in this way and suggested it be adopted more broadly across the team (I‚Äôm not saying this is sufficient just something that was done). Admittedly, to your point on <a href="https://gyazo.com/40c0be8b6762ac8a27166c9e41013f89" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">groups like CSDO</a> I have tended to eventually defer (although not always happily) to the broader consensus so as not to miss the forest for the trees when decisions became too controversial. This was one of those cases although I don‚Äôt necessarily blame anyone for their thinking at the time nor do I in any way blame the current PGF team ‚Äì this is an exercise in trying to find a path forward.</p>
<p>To be sure, I don‚Äôt even necessarily want to insert my own value judgement on a specific partner into this conversation. The fundamental question is: how do we design a process around what partners fit our values and how do we ensure that this decision-making is surfaced to the community.</p>
<p>As <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/essemharris">@essemharris</a> put it this is all about understanding <strong>community intervention</strong> and more generally <strong>how the community can feel heard</strong> in advance of potentially controversial choices.</p>
<p><strong>Critically:</strong> I also don‚Äôt want us to get trapped in ‚Äúexactly what process we should put forward here‚Äù which is why I suggested the minimum viable path. We need something simple that allows relevant voices like Hudson / Lefteris / others above (who have done a lot for us historically) to learn about and engage on what is happening before it‚Äôs on Twitter.</p>

            <p><strong>TL;dr</strong>: We should design a GCP that formalizes (1) when the Stewards Council can intervene in a partnership opportunity, (2) the nature of that intervention, and (3) how, if at all, the partner or the Gitcoin Foundation can appeal the Steward Council‚Äôs decision. This GCP design should begin immediately after the partnership development process made transparent to the community.</p>
<hr>
<p>Hey all, it‚Äôs Essem, one of your newly-elected Steward Council members. I spent a good portion of the past two days carefully reviewing community feedback on this forum, our Discord, social media sites, and soliciting some directly from people in and around web3. Here‚Äôs my perspective:</p>
<p>The Shell partnership represents a clear and energizing opportunity to improve upon our DAO governance principles, and we have a responsibility to do so given the importance of Gitcoin to the web3 community. We must recognize that when folks are out there tweeting their disappointment, they do it out of love. They want Gitcoin, and the values it embodies, to succeed; those same values were why I was so eager to join the Stewards Council when the opportunity arose! So, in many ways, I‚Äôm excited this happened. We‚Äôre being called on to do good work.</p>
<p>The community affected by a decision must feel they have a legitimate opportunity to voice their opinion and, if necessary, register their disapproval; this is the essence of democracy. No taxation without representation. The slogan doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúno taxes ever.‚Äù It just means that taxes cannot be levied without the people‚Äôs consent. Sometimes, often even, democracy means decisions don‚Äôt go quite to your liking. As someone who cares quite deeply about environmental issues and renewable energy, I happen to agree with the broad swath of folks criticizing the Shell partnership. It feels like greenwashing to me too, and $500,000 does not even begin to address the tremendous violence Shell has, knowingly, inflicted on communities around the globe. Had it come up for a vote, I would have voted Against and actively campaigned for others to do so. I think that is part and parcel of the motivation that led <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation">@ceresstation</a> to make this post. It‚Äôs not just that folks disagree with the partnership but that it‚Äôs something with significant and long-lasting implications for the Gitcoin platform and was executed without any community voice.</p>
<p>So Gitcoin simply cannot say: ‚Äútrust us, we know what we‚Äôre doing.‚Äù Nor should it say: ‚Äúround participants must be universally adored by all.‚Äù Instead, it must say: ‚Äúwe will change our decision-making process so that the community has greater voice in important decisions.‚Äù</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation">@ceresstation</a> has proposed one solution. I disagree with it. I don‚Äôt think creating a new body to review partnership decisions is wise, and certainly not one drawn from a list of candidates hand-picked by one person. (But it also sounds like <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation">@ceresstation</a> meant to stoke a debate more than to have that proposal carried out literally.) It may seem self-serving for me to say this but I think this is exactly the type of responsibility that should lie with the Stewards Council.</p>
<p>The PGF team does the laborious work of cold-calling brands and organizations to raise money for Featured Rounds. Let‚Äôs not forget how grueling and often thankless that work is and, as frustrating as it may be to accept, generally popular organizations would be unwilling to even tentatively explore a partnership if it meant doing so would subject them to widespread scrutiny. The risks for internal web3 evangelists at these organizations would become prohibitive. And I wouldn‚Äôt agree with the idea that Gitcoin should, prima facie, reject partnership opportunities simply because they may be controversial. <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ccerv1">@ccerv1</a> was making a point similar to this.</p>
<p>First, to me, the question is <strong>when community intervention should occur</strong>; at what point do partnership discussions reach a mature enough stage that they should be reviewed by the Stewards Council? Truthfully, I don‚Äôt know the answer to that question. But the process by which partnerships are developed should be laid transparent to the community so that we can have a healthy debate about it.</p>
<p>Then, the question is <strong>what‚Äôs the nature of the community intervention</strong>. Obviously, this is going to be relative to the point at which the intervention occurs. The earlier in the process, the more confidential the intervention. Perhaps the Gitcoin Foundation could brief the Stewards Council in private, and the Stewards Council could vote to approve or disapprove the partnership; then, the community would be informed of the fact that the vote has taken place and the votes of each Stewards Council member without revealing the potential partner. I‚Äôm not sure how realistic that is, but it‚Äôs a starting point for thought.</p>
<p>Finally, the question is <strong>by what process, if any, the partner or the Gitcoin Foundation could appeal the Stewards Council decision</strong>. I think the obvious venue is a Snapshot vote to all GTC holders. Most partners would probably abandon their efforts here but, regardless, any veto point has to have a paired appeal point.</p>

<p>I think 99% of our audience see gitcoin as the program and that makes sense, so for ‚Äòmass market‚Äô comms, imo it really really should, because of all points mentioned above. For grants stack tailor-made and individual comms seem more appropriate, plus they have their own twitter accounts now, I assume for the reason of creating more (much needed) clarity.

            <p>I am generally interested in testing out something like this, perhaps not this exact proposal, but something similar could be worth experimenting with.</p>
<p>However, <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation">@ceresstation</a> I can‚Äôt shake the feeling your position on this is unfair and disingenuous. Yes, you have now stepped away from the DAO, but when this deal originally came up, you were a PGF lead, and THE partnerships lead. This was debated extensively among many workstreams, CSDO, and across the DAO. Why didn‚Äôt you speak up then?</p>
<p>I can‚Äôt deny that I feel like half of this outrage is due to the way it was announced and positioned. The marketing and Twitter thread lacked a lot of context and was done in a poor manner. Many of <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/m0nkeyfl0wer">@M0nkeyFl0wer</a>‚Äôs suggestions on how to approach the subject and how it was sensitive were not heeded. Taking this money is totally optional for grantees.</p>
<p>Shell is also one of 100‚Äôs of entities that have funded matching pools over the years. It‚Äôs probably not feasible to have a vote for every single potential funder, but we also don‚Äôt need to emphasize any 1 so much more than others. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs become extremely hard to raise matching pool funds in this bear market, and much of the loud criticism is coming from people who have benefited immensely from matching pool funds over the years. I think a lot of this outrage could have been avoided, but if we want to turn down Shell‚Äôs money (that would be going from Shell to open source and public good climate projects), we can, but any support with raising funds from other sources would be much appreciated.</p>

            <p>you also wrote this while i was writing my response. appreciate a lot of this as well - but like i said, im not sure we wouldn‚Äôt be criticized and questioned if the Shell partnership was with another Gitcoin product.</p>
<p>i agree that a lot of people still associate us with just the program - but i dont think that means it should be prioritized over the rest. but if we are saying its the soul of gitcoin then yes, we should take better care. but also if that is the case i dont believe that responsibility lies with just PGF as it impacts all of us, so i do think a reevaluation of decision making should involve the other workstreams.</p>
<p>but i do think we‚Äôre nearing a time when that might not be the case (although hard to say given we are still pretty much pre PMF for Passport, Allo and GS) and so we do need evaluation criteria across the board.</p>
<p>and i think that criteria can evolve as we become less known for the grants program only.</p>
<p>curious, who is responsible for the forum post to action plan pipeline? CSDO?</p>

            <p>the concern about this particular partnership was brought up within our community - by someone working for the DAO - a very long time ago and yet we did not react. this to me feels no only a failure to ‚Äúlisten to the community‚Äù but a shared failure to hear each other and a collective lack of coordination.</p>
<p>similarly, i know there were concerns raised prior to other past inflammatory events that ended up being scrutinized by the public/the broader community.</p>
<p>even personally i often feel unsure of the right place, time and process for raising an opinion or challenging a decision or practice. i dont really even understand what goes to the forum or to a vote vs. what doesnt, beyond our budgets.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm wondering if this is a symptom of a larger problem which is lack of codified process around decision making and/or governance as well as when and how we align and engage the DAO in addition to the the wider community in those decisions.</p>
<p>i dont view this as a challenge for only the program, but for Gitcoin as a whole, which extends to all of our products/workstreams. im in no way expecting all of us to always agree, but some kind of codified process in which we all feel heard - and help the community feel heard - feels necessary. and this doesnt pertain to everything; i agree with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/viriya">@Viriya</a> that clear criteria is essential and that there might be different criteria for different areas of the org/types of decisions.</p>
<p>to the point about allo and our permissionless technologies - if Shell wanted to fund an Allo hackathon I do wonder if we‚Äôd (Gitcoin, Allo, etc) wouldn‚Äôt be equally scrutinized, even if we do say its credibly neutral. it‚Äôs still associated with Gitcoin (side note, i do think this reflects the right decision to separate the Gitcoin name/brand from the others, as otherwise they‚Äôd all be subject to being under fire) - i make this point because once again, i dont think this is purely a grants program issue.</p>
<p>Rather than see us form a council as a next step, I‚Äôd encourage us to look inward to assess our internal DAO operations and simultaneously look at our counterparts in the space, using this to develop org standards, processes and tactics for dispute resolution as well as more process around how we handle things like this, which will just inevitably continue to come up as we grow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We need pre-defined guardrails ‚Äì daresay a strategy for the grants program. We don‚Äôt have a codified purpose, vision or values to drive decision-making for the program. We don‚Äôt have a business model for the grants program ‚Äì making it a MASSIVE MASSIVE cost center for the DAO. We don‚Äôt have guidelines on what kinds of partners align with these values or a sustainability plan.</p>
<p>I think it‚Äôs important to align on these things to be able to answer the questions Carl posed logically and thoroughly.</p>
<p>Fwiw, we have plans to create this after GG18 and we are now planning to involve the community in shaping this strategy.</p>
