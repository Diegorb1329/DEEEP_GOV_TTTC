Announcing Gitcoin’s Cookie Jar! :cookie::jar:

Using this site (built by Allo Lab) you can claim 0.0069 ETH every 30 days as long as youre full time at Gitcoin. You must leave a note saying what you used it for.

The social contract of this initiative is that you may only claim if youre doing something that supports Gitcoin…. I have funded the contract with 0.05 ETH to start, and if this is a hit (and is not abused) I will continue to fund it.

Use cases:
:white_check_mark: Got a bill that you want reimbursement for? Use the cookie jar.
:white_check_mark: Want to do something cool for gitcoin’ers at ETHDenver? Use the cookie jar.
:white_check_mark: Worked extra hard this week and want to treat yo’self? Use the cookie jar.

Site =>  https://cookiejar.gitcoin.co/

Things you can do here =>

0. connect to optimism network
1. claim 0.0069 ETH per every 30 days
2. view past claims + their notes

Zooming out: This is an onchain capital allocation experiment in creating more optimistic governance and a more permissionless culture where if you have an idea you can execute it.    I will be reviewing the notes and removing people who abuse the jar (my judgement for now, but we can decentralize this later) and we will iterate form there.  More about this mechanism => https://allo.expert/mechanisms/cookie-jar

Call to action
1. If you fit the eligibil/ty criteria and have an eth address you want added to the cookie jar whitelist, pls comment in the  thread below.
2. If you are a Gitcoin ecosystem member and you want a cookie jar for your ecosystem let us know.

            <p>Love this focus, I am a Gitcoin Citizen and Delegate, so even if this accounts for my time spent providing my thoughts on Gov Posts, sharing Gitcoin socially, or voting on snapshot/tally votes, understand this effort is appreciated.</p>
<p>Should this type of activity qualify I would love to be considered for whitelisting. 0x461acd846B4cc249b96242F1AB7c72a39d94747c</p>

<p>you can donate to the cookie jar by sending eth to its address onchain.</p>
<p>maybe one day we will enable in-app donations and multi-token donations</p>

            <p>First Post here on the Forum, just a Dark Forest explorer excited to cultivate this Infinite Garden!</p>
<p>Love that folks can claim FROM Cookie Jar,</p>
<p>Does it make sense to allow people to “Donate” to the Cookie Jar?</p>
<p>Im sure that simple functionality brings up a slew of its own thoughts and experiments…</p>
<p>But might be an interesting place to Allow for High Value Signal to come through.</p>

            <p>I have pending bills and aspire to attend international conferences, but limited access to funding has been a significant barrier. I would greatly appreciate having my wallet address whitelisted for this initiative. Thank you.</p>
