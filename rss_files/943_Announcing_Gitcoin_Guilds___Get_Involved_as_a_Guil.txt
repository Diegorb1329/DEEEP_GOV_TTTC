    # Announcing Gitcoin Guilds â€“ Get Involved as a Guild Lead!

g(uild)m Gitcoin community!

Weâ€™re excited to announce that Guilds are making a comeback!

As part of our ongoing efforts to support builders at every stage and create a more connected ecosystem, weâ€™re rolling out guilds to provide a structured and valuable experience for Gitcoin Citizens.

Each guild will serve as a gathering place for citizens to connect, collaborate, and grow together.

### Why Guilds?

With Guilds, we hope to:

* Deepen engagement within the Gitcoin ecosystem, bringing the focus back to quality over quantity
* Nurture a supportive and active environment by creating intentional spaces for connecting & networking with like-minded individuals
* Strengthen Gitcoinâ€™s identity and help further define community values

### Guild Structure

Weâ€™re starting with three guilds (with a fourth on the way!) focused on the core pillars of Gitcoinâ€™s Grants Program mission:

* Grantees â€“ For past & present Gitcoin grantees, focused on grant management, best practices, and community collaboration.
  * note: you must either have actively participated in a past GG round or have an active application for the current round (GG23) to be considered a grantee
* Builders â€“ For developers, product managers, designers, and others building in Ethereum, focused on project development and technical collaboration.
* Donors â€“ For funders and supporters of public goods, focused on impact measurement, donor networking, and funding strategies.
* Data (coming soon) â€“ For analysts and governance researchers focused on analyzing grants, funding models, and governance optimization.

### How It Works

1. Head on over to our [Discord](https://gitcoin.co/discord) and jump into the #guild-start-here channel
2. From here, you can select the applicant role for the guild youâ€™d like to join. This will give you access to the channel, and you can start engaging!
3. Guild leads will approve new applicants (via meaningful engagement) and help manage the guilds, ensuring activity remains on-topic, productive, and abides by our [code of conduct](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/about-gitcoin/code-of-conduct).

Each guild will host structured engagement loops like AMAs and weekly themed discussions to keep things dynamic and valuable. Guild performance will be measured through engagement metrics (e.g. number of active guild members, participation in events), retention & growth metrics, impact metrics (e.g. improved grant performance, increased governance participation), and surveys sent out by the Gitcoin team.

### Interested in Becoming a Guild Lead?

Guild leads will play a key role in driving the success of this initiative. If youâ€™re passionate about building a more connected Gitcoin community and want to take on a leadership role, weâ€™d love to hear from you!

Guild leads will be responsible for:

* Approving new members
* Facilitating regular discussions and events
* Encouraging collaboration and knowledge-sharing
* Tracking engagement and providing feedback

If youâ€™re interested in becoming a guild lead, please reach out to me directly or comment below â€“ weâ€™d love to have you on board!

### Whatâ€™s Next?

Weâ€™ll be tracking engagement, retention, and impact metrics to measure the success of this initiative and adjust as needed. This is just the beginning â€“ as the guilds grow, weâ€™ll be looking for ways to scale and further enhance the experience. We plan to use GG23 as an experimentation phase, taking the time to learn what truly works for our community and what doesnâ€™t.

Thanks for being part of Gitcoin â€“ weâ€™re excited to see how guilds help shape the future of our community!

            <p>Happy to hear that, <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kylejensen">@kylejensen</a>!<br>
Some time ago, there was something called <strong>Builderband</strong>: Gitcoinâ€™s High-Performance Hackathon Alumni Network, which saw a lot of engagement, including Discord sessions with over 200 attendees. Iâ€™m sure Gitcoin Guilds will be a success, as itâ€™s something that grantees, donors, builders, and analysts/researchers have been waiting for.</p>
