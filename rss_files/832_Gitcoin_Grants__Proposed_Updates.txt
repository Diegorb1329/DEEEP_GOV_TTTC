Gitcoin Grants: Proposed Updates
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-proposed-updates/17649
    **Overview**: Gitcoin is one of the longstanding players in the Ethereum ecosystem and is best known for its public goods funding program. The Gitcoin Grants Program started in 2019 and has distributed over $56M of funding to public goods that benefit Ethereum. It was one of the first and primary vehicles to test the revolutionary crowdfunding mechanism, Quadratic Funding.

19 rounds later, we‚Äôre even more passionate about the role of grants in growing the Ethereum ecosystem and ensuring its success and sustainability. We‚Äôve learned a lot over the last 19 rounds, and we‚Äôre due to turn some of those learnings into action and a few changes to the program!

**What we‚Äôve learned**:

* The strongest (and most growth) grantee demand is in the open-source software category. Grants managers who come to Gitcoin to run their rounds are heavily focused on funding software/dApp builders, and it‚Äôs clear that growing these projects is linked to the success of Ethereum. We want to strengthen our focus on the OSS round to support this.
* Independently run grant rounds are playing a larger role in funding what matters. Our motivation in launching a Grants protocol + dApp was to enable anyone to run their grants programs, and it‚Äôs finally possible! We‚Äôve moved from Gitcoin running all of the rounds to having ~50 different communities launch on Grants Stack since June.
* Measuring project impact is becoming increasingly possible and important criteria in funding decisions. We‚Äôre excited to support these efforts by participating in Regen Learnings and future product efforts to measure better and track impact.

Based on these learnings, we‚Äôre proposing a series of changes to the Gitcoin Grants program.

**Open Source Software Round (+ Eth Infrastructure)**

First, Gitcoin will only operate one core round, Open Source Software. Due to the small size of the Eth Infra round (19 projects in GG19), Eth Infrastructure projects will be included in this round. We are interested in exploring how this round may be segmented and encouraging feedback from the community on areas of innovation (e.g., account abstraction) within OSS and potential categories for bootstrapped vs. VC-backed projects.

Second, we will increase the target matching pool for Open Source Software to $1M each round (vs $250k currently.) This will continue to be funded through our fundraising efforts, partnerships, and the gitcoin.eth matching pool. This change, as well as the core focus on OSS, is designed to deepen our investment in what we believe is the most meaningful role that our program can play in Ethereum‚Äôs growth. We believe that the strong demand from EVM-based grants programs and our depth and history in supporting OSS are a perfect fit!

Finally, we will move the Open Source Software round to run twice annually (every six months) vs every three months as it has traditionally. This allows us to dedicate larger matching pools for each round and strengthens our impact reporting and evaluation focus. When running rounds every 3 months, there are often only 6 weeks between grantees receiving funds and when they start working on their next application. This doesn‚Äôt give them enough time to effect or demonstrate their impact from the previous grant.

**Web3 Community and Education Round** (*this section has been updated from the initial post thanks to feedback from this community*)

We are proposing to transition the Web3 Community Round to a governance-led initiative. In this revised structure, we will create a dedicated pool of funds (up to $125K quarterly) to support ‚Äúmatching on matching‚Äù pools, with no quotas on the funds provided. This means that any funds raised by communities are eligible for matching without the previously mentioned cap of up to $25K. This adjustment aims to replace the Gitcoin-run Web3 Community and Education round, allowing aligned communities to fund what matters to them more directly and increase the matching funds available during Gitcoin Grants rounds.

For GG20, we will limit the number of community rounds to 5 to ensure we can provide adequate support in this new format. However, we anticipate increasing the number of rounds in future iterations.

We propose electing a slate of badgeholders to decide which communities/rounds are eligible for funding. These badgeholders should be active in the grants community but not core contributors to Gitcoin. If this proposal passes, we commit to gradually giving the council more authority over time. This includes creating new matching pools in areas they feel are underserved, such as a potential web3 journalism round.

Following the approval of this proposal, we will proceed with an election process for badgeholders, outline the eligibility criteria, and detail the application process for Community Rounds, ensuring a transparent and inclusive approach to governance.

**NOTE**: For GG20, we propose hosting the round with a slightly adjusted governance process to give us time to codify procedures and processes moving forward fully. More details on this will follow in a separate governance post.

**Proposed Gitcoin Grants Program schedule for 2024:**

* GG20, April 2024: Open Source software round + 5 community rounds
* GG21, June 2024: Citizen‚Äôs retro funding round + 5 community rounds
* GG22, August 2024: Open Source software round + 5 community rounds
* GG23, December 2024: Citizen‚Äôs retro funding round + 5 community rounds

**Conclusion**

We hope these changes create a bigger and better version of the Gitcoin Grants program ‚Äì with more funding going towards grantees, focusing on funding areas of strong ecosystem demand and innovation, and proving that Grants = Growth. If this proposal passes, we‚Äôll commit to the following:

* Executing the changes as described above
* Quickly creating and rolling out a badgeholder program for approving community round funding
* Regular reporting (post-GG20 and EOY) of the impact of these changes

Regardless of whether this passes, we‚Äôll continue to pursue operational excellence for the program and grant innovation. We‚Äôve run the Gitcoin Grants Program 19 times and still feel like we‚Äôre just getting started ‚Äì there‚Äôs so much growth and learning ahead. We welcome your feedback on this proposal and appreciate your continued support of Gitcoin Grants!

            <p>Thanks for the updates Meg! I have changed my mind to vote FOR these changes, mostly for the following reasons;</p>
<ol>
<li>Fits with gitcoins endgame of ossifying the protocol and exiting to community. Narrowing from various categories to a single one and then eventually zero gitcoin hosted rounds is the logical path forward, the only disagreements can be on the right timing (which no one can know for sure in advance)</li>

<p>I would push back on this as an oversimplification. The issue isn‚Äôt only funding  (which is honestly quite low relative to most projects budget) but the loss of a public space where diverse projects in the ecosystem come together on one stage and share learnings with one another + mobilize their own community to support them. I often tell people the metric to optimize for in gitcoin rounds is not funding received but growth in twitter followers <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/rofl.png?v=12" title=":rofl:" class="emoji" alt=":rofl:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> I‚Äôm curious to see whether community rounds will fill up the vacuum left by gitcoin in this regard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incentivizes projects in the web3 community and education space to develop open source software. I would love for there to be support to projects that were in web3 community and education earlier but successfully used those funds to build a product with an active repo and are now eligible for the OSS round</p>

            <p>Hi all ‚Äì the Grants Lab team met yesterday to discuss the feedback and recommend some adjustments to the proposal! Again, wanted to thank everyone for the fantastic engagement and discussion here and in 1x1s, DMs, etc.</p>
<p><strong>OSS Round</strong><br>
The feedback has been nearly unanimously positive on the 2x yearly, $1M format. I think we have a strong vote of confidence to proceed with this!</p>
<p><strong>Web3 Community &amp; Education</strong><br>
We‚Äôve received a few categories of feedback on this, in order of volume:</p>
<ul>
<li>The majority of feedback was from donors or grants managers who were supportive of the new format. There‚Äôs been a lot of acknowledgement that the scope of the round has expanded very widely, which makes it more difficult to fundraise for (where do your matching funds go?) and donate to or support. From the internal Gitcoin team‚Äôs perspective, we feel that raising the average quality of grantees is best solved through decentralization. Given our desire for credible neutrality, we‚Äôre ill-positioned to make controversial decisions on eligibility. Additionally I believe that external communities hold far greater subject matter expertise in the sub-areas of community &amp; education (eg - journalism, desci, AI, climate) that are applying for funding.</li>
<li>The second category of feedback was from previous grantees who are excited to run their own rounds. I‚Äôm really excited to see this enthusiasm and we‚Äôre already preparing to support them! Many of these individuals noted that the fundraising bar might prevent them from participating ‚Äì we‚Äôve had some great dialogue on that in the forum.</li>
<li>The third category of feedback came from a small but vocal group of grantees who are disappointed to see the current format evolve and potentially lose a source of funding for their organizations. We recognize that this is a possibility and appreciate that change is hard ‚Äì though we very much hope to see former grantees eligible and participating in the new format! We commit to measuring former grantee funding and involvement in this new structure. We hope to see 50% of former grantees who apply receive funding equivalent to their previous participation in Web3 Community.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Moving forward</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We‚Äôll proceed to a snapshot vote with the recommended OSS changes</li>
<li>We‚Äôll revise the proposal to remove any quotas on the funds provided to matching pool ‚Äì so that any funds raised are eligible for matching.</li>
<li>We will limit the number of community rounds for GG20 at 5 to make sure that we can properly support them in this new format, but anticipate raising this in future rounds.</li>
<li>If the proposal passes, we commit to giving the council more and more authority over time ‚Äì including the ability to create new matching pools (like a web3 journalism round) in areas they feel are underserved.</li>
<li>We‚Äôll leave this post open for another 2 days (though 2/15) and then proceed to a snapshot vote</li>

            <p>Cant agree more 10k and 5k rounds will do more justice to the smaller web3 communities especially in Africa, Yes giving more priority to OSS makes lots of sense. Question what comes first the product or community i believe community and education are vital for mass adoption of any web3 tooling that comes from OSS lets reduce the 25k cap and be considerate of emerging or smaller communities</p>

            <p>I really like how these changes make it more straightforward what Gitcoin does, allowing the DAO to focus on its core priority and setting up Gitcoin for scaling faster and further!</p>
<p>I also quite like this novel approach to funding community rounds - if it works as a flywheel I believe it could generate even more funding for niche community categories than in the previous approach. There are obviously risks. Perhaps we could predefine some metrics to track for relative success of this new approach and re-evaluate after the first two rounds have been run under the new approach?</p>

            <p>I agree w/ <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/zer8">@ZER8</a> on this. Having some portion of the $125K set aside for rounds that don‚Äôt make the $25K threshold could help create on-ramps for new round operators to gain experience. I say this even as someone who‚Äôs org (the TEC) has, and will likely continue to, run $25K+ rounds. Something like three $10K and four $5K matching pools would probably a bit more work, but in addition to helping to grow the field of round operators, it might also help generate more diversity in the rounds. The Web3 Community and Education round held a lot of that diversity previously and it would be sad to see that go.</p>

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/abitrolly">@abitrolly</a> thanks for the feedback! Almost every project in the Open Source Software round is a crypto-based project, so you can rest assured that all funds here are going to crypto-oriented orgs. You can see all projects that participated in the last round here: <a href="https://reportcards.gitcoin.co/424/0xd4cc0dd193c7dc1d665ae244ce12d7fab337a008" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://reportcards.gitcoin.co/424/0xd4cc0dd193c7dc1d665ae244ce12d7fab337a008</a> . While we‚Äôd love to onboard popular Web3 OSS projects in the future, our focus is squarely on Web3 for now!</p>

<p>Due to the small size of the Eth Infra round (19 projects in GG19), Eth Infrastructure projects will be included in this round.</p>

</aside>
<p>What is the % of the fund allocation to these projects? Eth community definitely knows so much more about crypto that even without Sybil spawns it is able to skew QF to their advantage, leaving the classical Open Source with less money. I worry that it may by significantly less.</p>
<p>My experience with convincing Open Source projects to participate is that it is hard, because there is a lot of FUD around crypto. Even Python Software Foundation could not find experts to dispel or confirm (mis)conceptions. Therefore even for popular Open Source project, I assume the amount of people able to operate with crypto, and from them the amount of people willing to donate, and from them the amount of people who can go through the Gitcoin donation process is drastically lower.</p>
<p>It would be nice of course, to calculate crypto literacy for projects. The amount of Gitcoin contributions / subscribers. Maybe also balanced by amount donated. To get metric that reflects  project‚Äôs economic value (users + users‚Äô financial well-being) .</p>

<p>Great point. The thing is that in my scenario it would be up to the badge holders, whom are part of GC Community, to determine that. I think the point is to delegate some of these tedious round running aspects to the community while shining a light on OSS so GC‚Äôs initial goal of growing the Ethereum ecosystem is still in tact. This will allow the GC team to focus on the overall post metrics and adjust as needed. Then fine tuning the GG program for better results, round to round. I can only imagine the bandwidth it takes to do what they do. It maybe time for the willing community to assist.</p>

<p>Plus 1 to this. I‚Äôm guessing that the decision to eliminate the web3 round came from the fact that value inflow and curation are difficult to tackle for this round, but this is an assumption.

<p>This raises a question, how would someone like ZackXBT apply to those rounds? If all the rounds have their own eligibility then someone like zack might be able to apply in all of them? (if the round owners decide it ofc) .This would not be ideal also imo.</p>

<p>I am of the opinion we should keep web3 community so he can fundraise from his well-wishers and gitcoin keeps mindshare in this space, while potentially lowering the matching in the round to an amount Gitcoin is comfortable with.</p>
<p>To overcome the issue of scammy projects in the round, it can also be kept invite only or heavy screening with an application process requiring projects to show proof of regular content creation &amp; engagement.</p>

            <p>I do agree that(at least in my perception) the OSS round has been getting less attention in the past few GGs as other types of rounds have been getting traction and it‚Äôs great to see the matching pool 4x to $1M. This  + the fact that the rounds will twice/year is a great strategic decision! Kudos!</p>
<p>Unfortunately while I understand why Gitcoin decided to shut down the Web3 Community and Education round I believe that the decision to only match communities with $25k in matching pools is not optimal. <strong>My worry is  that this is just gonna create an ‚Äúecho chamber‚Äù of aligned and already funded organizations that will run rounds and get matching for this.</strong> They will possibly be of higher quality because having 25k to run a round would imply a certain level of prosperity and organization for the matchee, but what about the smol guys? <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=12" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>How about some compromise here? Maybe having something like $100k to match $25k rounds and the other 25k to match smaller rounds based on a more strict curation/review.</p>

<p>We propose electing a slate of badgeholders to decide which communities/rounds are eligible for funding. We propose electing badgeholders active in the grants community but not core contributors to Gitcoin. If this proposal passes, we will follow up with an election process for badgeholders, an outline of eligibility criteria, and the application process for Community Rounds.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is great news! Personally I would love to apply as a badgeholder and curate rounds(already have some XP here), but would still like to push the idea above, to allow smaller rounds to get matched without having 25k. Maybe the matchings we offered to run rounds on Arbitrum can help as an <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-300k-arbitrum-matching-fest-for-running-rounds-on-arbitrum-one/16940">example</a></p>

            <p>IMO, I don‚Äôt think this new proposal is a bad idea. It would work out in terms of impact tracking and giving grantees enough time to utilize the funds and generate impact for their community.<br>
However, just like many here, I am worried about the effect it will have on smaller communities who participate in the Web3 community and education rounds. As <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/lanzdingz">@lanzdingz</a> mentioned, these communities may not be able to raise the $25k proposed amount.<br>
<a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/sov">@Sov</a> I suggest we amend this proposal while keeping the same points and budget.</p>
<p>Amendment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Appointed badge holders will be split into groups in charge of picking x amount of small communities, mid-sized communities, and large communities that will be matched.</li>
<li>These badge holders will come up with elements that make up their ‚Äúavatar community‚Äù</li>
<li>The ‚Äúmatching on matching pool‚Äù fund will be split in to these 3 tiers of small, mid, and large communities.</li>
<li>Based on the tiers‚Äô budget, the badge holders will know how many projects/communities‚Äô matching pool will be matched.</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe with this slight amendment arises a compromise where most are still included, the Ethereum ecosystem is still enhanced, and <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a> /GC Community‚Äôs vision of GG‚Äôs continuous growth will still be on track. In actually, doing it like this will grow the matching pools and vicariously assist more grantees. Also, this is a way for communities to bring economical value to the GitCoin table instead of only extracting it. <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/man_shrugging/5.png?v=12" title=":man_shrugging:t5:" class="emoji" alt=":man_shrugging:t5:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>The Arbitrum matching program is not mutually exclusive to the work of Gitcoin Grants.

With that being said we would only be running rounds on networks that are currently supported on Grants Stack.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/thedevanshmehta">@thedevanshmehta</a> makes a good point on the $25K threshold being suitable only for certain well capitalized communities.

</aside>
<p>Yes, very fair point.  As I mention above the $25K minimum was a precedent that was established some time back and I think we would be open to changing it now that we are looking to add additional matching funds.</p>
