https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/temp-check-accelerating-product-adoption-via-meta-governance/16768
    ## Summary

* Trial run a meta-governance squad to spur adoption of the DAOs‚Äô products
* Assist newbies and veterans with DAO2DAO governance
* Compliment the [Governance Roadmap](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/governance-roadmap-s19-20-beyond/16645) by incentivizing community to play an active role governance strategy

## Abstract

Metagovernance is the act of one DAO participating in the governance process of another through the use of a token. Further reading [here](https://www.bankless.com/ultimate-guide-to-metagovernance).This proposal aims to establish a public meta-governance workstream with the goal of incentivizing and mentoring passionate contributors to understand and execute on a DAO2DAO governance strategy to accelerate adoption of the DAOs products in the wider crypto ecosystem. The milestone based meta-governance workstream will run over the course of 6 months which will involve a weekly sync, guidance and mentorship for contributors and performance based compensation using direct grants via Grants stack.

## Motivation

The Gitcoin ecosystem, with its MMM, Product, and PGF Teams, is robust and driven towards enhancing the adoption of Gitcoin‚Äôs products. However, each of these groups lacks the expertise and support to effectively tap into the potential of DAO2DAO (D2D) collaborations. The question then arises: How can we optimise the returns on D2D collaborations to expedite product adoption, without giving the impression of engaging in zero-sum games?

Meta-governance has joined the chat‚Ä¶

Almost a year ago, BanklessDAO faced similar challenges. Vibes were low and product adoption was down. At this critical moment, the DAO approved [a proposal to fund a meta-governance workstream](https://forum.bankless.community/t/daostewards-funding-proposal/4755). Since then, the DAO was able to raise funds to

1. 50k to fund its [humanitarian relief initiative](https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0xb748c0fa726bb7c7051d474b9273147920d9a2119c9e062ac5231d3edc70f49e) via 1inchDAO
2. Deliver a global [education and onboarding campaign](https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-banklessdao-s-global-campaign-to-spread-the-optimistic-vision/6113) worth 100K for OptimismDAO
3. [2x revenues](https://forum.bankless.community/t/gitcoin-grants-round-18/8293/12) to over 25k from Gitcoin Grant Round
4. 50k+ raised funds from other PGF projects like [RPGF2](https://forum.bankless.community/t/optimism-rpfg2-distribution/5837), [Octant](https://discuss.octant.app/t/banklessdao-global-education-and-onboarding-for-cryptonatives/66), [ArbitrumFest](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/0x59d79b22595b17af659ce9b03907615f53742c57/0x59d79b22595b17af659ce9b03907615f53742c57-7) etc

In order to accelerate product adoption and expand the quantity and quality of contributors, we, [DAOplomats](https://daoplomats.org/), propose to establish and run a meta-governance workstream with the aim of:

1. Facilitating the DAO2DAO governance conversation in Gitcoin
2. Drive adoption of gitcoin products in other DAOs
3. Secure funding for PGF (program rounds)

## Specification

#### Meta-governance Facilitation

If this proposal is approved, the workstream will be kickstarted with a kickoff sync where we will assess the totality of external and internal talent, experience and availability of contributors as well as invite mulit-DAO delegates to join the conversation.We will work with existing stewards and members from core teams to hit the ground running from the get go. We will facilitate a weekly sync for all interested participants along with async chats to help participants in their journey.

Over the course of the program, stewards will be incentivized to participate in governance at other DAOs, gain reputation, increase voting weight, and leverage it to propose gitcoin‚Äôs products and services in those communities. The workstream will also invite multi-DAO delegates with pre-existing experience and reputation to assist the squad and accelerate positive outcomes.

We will not only focus on external governance but also assist existing and new contributors towards understanding and innovating on the [Governance Roadmap](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/governance-roadmap-s19-20-beyond/16645), thus enabling a broader pool of talent to get highly engaged in Gitcoin governance.

**Signal your interest by adding your general availability [here](https://lettucemeet.com/l/blEL2), so we can identify a time slot that fits most people**

#### Retroactive rewards

Stewards who actively participate will be eligible for retroactive compensation proportional to their results. We suggest that this performance driven compensation be proportional to

* size of funds raised for PGF (program rounds)
* number of passports activated
* number of DAOs adoption grants stack

These payments will be done in the form of direct grants via Grants stack. This mechanism not only ensures that the right contributions are rewarded, but that the DAO continues using its products for its own benefit.

Active stewards will receive base compensation at the end of each milestone. Base compensation will be equally divided amongst all active stewards. The definition of active stewards as well as performance based compensation will be agreed with the participants and posted on the forum.

##### Roadmap towards self-sustainability:

There are several delegate compensation programs at [Aave](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-expansion-of-orbit-a-dao-funded-delegate-platform-initiative/14785), [Maker](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP61#abstain-modifier-motivation), [Optimism](https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-delegate-rewards-season-4/6878), [1inch](https://gov.1inch.io/discussion/11322-1ip-29-recognized-delegates-program) which yield an average of 3-5k/month/delegate in income for the participating group. Stewards who are sufficiently trained and motivated will not only be able fund themselves while helping Gitcoin with product adoption, but will create a long term value flow between DAOs and across the larger ecosystem, which will ultimately help us as a crypto community resist Moloch and unlock the potential of DAOs.

#### Budget (requested) in GTC:

||Milestone 1: 3-months|Milestone 2: 3-months|
| --- | --- | --- |
|MetaGov Facilitation|15,000|15,000|
|Retro Base compensation|15,000|15,000|
|Retro Performance based compensation|20,000|20,000|

Total ask: 100,000 GTC

##### Benefits

This novel approach is designed based on our research and experience as delegates in several DAOs. Overall it incentivizes

* New ways for the community to engage and potentially be compensated
* Encourages newbies and veterans to strategically place attention toward long term thinking and goals which ultimately help Gitcoin fulfil it‚Äôs essential intents
* Offers a flexible pool of contributors, independent of fixed ‚Äúhired‚Äù contributors
* Enables permissionless contribution and allows high quality, result dependent outcomes to be compensated
* Potential to increase DAO2DAO collaboration and increase product adoption

##### Success measures:

* % of governance proposals in the roadmap emerging from stewards
* Grants stack adoption in new DAOs
* Number of Passports activated
* Total funding raised for matching pools

##### Milestone 1:

* At least 1 new DAO adopting products or funding the matching pool

##### Milestone 2:

* At least 2 new DAOs adopting products or funding the matching pool

            <p>Sorry for my late reply here <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/jengajojo">@jengajojo</a><br>
I agree with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/meglister">@meglister</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/connor">@connor</a> here that I think this would be a really interesting GCP that I would likely vote yes for. I feel that we‚Äôre missing BD resources to support with meaningful D2D outreach (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/sov">@Sov</a>) through engagement with governance.</p>
<p>Sov, Meg and I have chatted about this being a channel we‚Äôd like to experiment with but it‚Äôs not a strategy that we‚Äôve proven will actually work for us‚Ä¶which is also why I don‚Äôt think a FT hire as <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/coachjonathan">@CoachJonathan</a> suggests is the way forward.</p>
<p>I think starting out with a lean experiment to see how it does would help move this proposal along. I recommend working directly with myself, Meg and Sov to make that GCP successful if you go that route.</p>

            <p>I‚Äôm generally in favor of all kinds of experiments in governance, and I think exploration of how to deploy thoughtful, multi-talented stewards can only benefit the DAO.</p>
<p>I worry slightly that the narrowness of these performance metrics:</p>

<p>doesn‚Äôt directly seem to action on <span class="hashtag-raw">#1</span> stated here, which I‚Äôm most excited for:</p>

<li>Facilitating the DAO2DAO governance conversation in Gitcoin</li>
<li>Drive adoption of gitcoin products in other DAOs</li>
<li>Secure funding for PGF (program rounds)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Recently, some personal experiences facilitating conversations in DAOs, emerging DAOs and non-DAO community orgs have manifested a few ways-of-working-together that I want to also suggest as potential outcomes, if deploying the DAO2DAO strength of this initiative:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hyper-local use cases for protocols/blockchain tech (a la ‚Äúdo what doesn‚Äôt scale‚Äù)</li>
<li>Research and writing that expands the audience for blockchain-initiatives beyond the normal purview</li>
<li>‚ÄúMarket discovery‚Äù - almost a misnomer, but not sure what else to call this - for Gitcoin‚Äôs path, I think this means exploration of who needs QF-enablement IRL</li>
<li>Huge benefit of any teams building tech: product feedback focus groups (<a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/jengajojo">@jengajojo</a> mentions this above in response to CoachJ on PMF- but deserves re-centering)</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I‚Äôm in support of more active stewardship to shepherd Gitcoin and I think the theme <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/jengajojo">@jengajojo</a> highlights about multi-DAO involvement is a great superpower to tap into.</p>

<p>i find this to be a little bit dismissive, moralizing, and a bit of straw man, as if there is no other option than your Option A.</p>
<p>all we really need is someone who is friendly/knowledgeable/organized/reputable/helpful going to other DAOs and representing grants stack or allo or passport.   like what lindsey from hedgey is doing here to optimism =&gt; <a href="https://gov.optimism.io/t/using-hedgeys-token-grant-platform-for-onchain-grant-payouts-at-optimism/667">https://gov.optimism.io/t/using-hedgeys-token-grant-platform-for-onchain-grant-payouts-at-optimism/667</a>.</p>
<p>then a bit of organization to manage the feedback/CRM.</p>
<p>adding all this metagovernance language just complicates what should be a pretty straightforward BD effort.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Imo, there are two ways of going about this, either onboard a service provider which has a track record of pushing proposals across various DAOs or build this talent inhouse.</p>
<p><em>Option A</em>: Usually professional delegates, and most of them are hesitant to shill only 1 service in order to avoid looking biased.</p>
<p><em>Option B</em>: While legacy sales techniques can be effective in DAOs which run <em>governance theatre</em>, the challange arises in those that don‚Äôt. The current sales efforts are sufficient at <em>‚ÄòDAO theatre‚Äô</em> crypto foundations imo.</p>
<p>In DAOs that are further along in their decentralization roadmap the boundaries are unclear, account management needs to be done towards a broad set of actors and customer success is a function of small teams such as grant councils (grant manager) as well as the larger community (passport users/donors on QF etc)</p>
<p><em>Bonus option</em>: Start a <a href="https://llama.mirror.xyz/UCz1P9cRT860Pi7-D9H968U-H3cxCxg3icGpZHVkGVQ" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">DAOlitical party</a> which offboards many of the challanges in option B to delegates and incentives them to independently shill. Over the long run this is more sustainable than funding BD teams which require the DAO to have a treasury in order to fund employees, vs. letting other DAOs fund loyalists from GitcoinDAO.</p>

            <p>My gut take: I applaud the effort and energy put into this proposal, but I‚Äôm leaning no.  I‚Äôd be supportive of a credible DAO to DAO BD effort though.</p>
<p>This leans way too much into meta work and governance for me. I‚Äôd vote for something that is more focused on organizing + pushing proposals to get other DAOs using Grants Stack/Passport.  Especially if the team has a proven track record working across DAOs.</p>
<p>Especially if product, marketing, or BD leaders who know what it takes to get product signed, sealed, and delivered voted yes.

            <p>Thinking about this more it makes much more sense as a GCP than as a workstream. Workstream implies some permanence imo, and should have a higher barrier, where this is proposed more like a GCP with specific defined milestones and outcomes. Perhaps that‚Äôs more aligned with what you were thinking? Context:</p>

            <p>Overall I think this is a solid proposal - well researched and laid out.</p>
<p>And while DeFi is not my forte, I did understand enough of the Bankless article you <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/jengajojo">@jengajojo</a> linked to to get that FEI was able to leverage their governance rights 9:1 by their investment in the INDEX metagovernance token.</p>

<ol>
<li>Facilitating the DAO2DAO governance conversation in Gitcoin</li>
<li>Drive adoption of gitcoin products in other DAOs</li>
<li>Secure funding for PGF (program rounds)</li>
</ol>
<p>These all seem worthy goals and goals 2 &amp; 3 are essential, I‚Äôd say. For 3.DAO2DAO governance it seems this would be a formalizing mechanism for what already takes place in the context of token swapping between DAOs, but, yes it could widen the conversation.</p>
<p>More to the point that I found most relevant (less about the mechanics) is widening the aperture for contributors to Gitcoin‚Äôs larger mission - Fund What Matters and now also make the products more widely known, understood and used.</p>
<p>Zooming out even more - I would like to see a wider focus not just on other DAOs but also on other sectors in addition to web3 and crypto native communities.</p>
<p>How I would think of this is as an Ambassadorship program.  It‚Äôs hard not to become an ‚Äòambassador‚Äô after participating in a few Gitcoin rounds or attending a couple of Schelling Points. So this enthusiasm and goodwill needs to be leveraged, appreciated and incentivized.</p>
<p>I, unfortunately, don‚Äôt personally know too many of the other stewards. But I imagine they are all involved deeply in their own communities and potentially could harness significant attention towards Gitcoin products and services.</p>
<p>So, in summary, I am for this proposal.  I think DAO2DAO is a good place to start, but should not be the only sectors we focus on for Gitcoin products and services PMF. I wonder if employing the phraseology of Ambassadorship program might make it easier for people to understand at first glance?</p>
<p>Thank you for this proposal <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/jengajojo">@jengajojo</a> and for your thoughtful comments above fellow Gitcoiners.</p>

<p>I agree with Connor - we have lots to work on within the DAO to create more community and steward engagement.</p>
<p>This is why I think it‚Äôs important to tap into experienced stewards/ delegates across multiple DAOs by creating a delegate rewards program. I would much rather see a governance sub DAO, which includes dao2dao collaboration, over a new workstream.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the feedback <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/coachjonathan">@CoachJonathan</a> <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/connor">@connor</a></p>
<p>I understand the hesitation given that the DAO is consolidating resources into the existing workstream, and I am happy to include this project inside one of the existing WS if the leads agree to this suggestion.</p>
<p>This project does not create new products, it‚Äôs main goal is to compliment existing and any new products which the DAO may produce for the long haul. While the goals may seem low from a BD perspective, we have sufficient evidence from legacy governance systems that delegates who can directly influence flow of funds at the parliamentary level generate 10-100X magnitude more sales revenue than any BD/sales teams do in a corporate setting. In the same way, if we can influence the flow of funds directly from key sources such as top DeFi protocols, L2s, etc‚Ä¶ and install <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-aqueduct/9684">aqueducts</a> via meta-governance then we‚Äôd have an easier time implementing ‚ÄòAlways on funding sources‚Äô as mentioned in <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-might-we-scale-gitcoins-impact-from-50mm-gmv-to-500m-gmv/16697">50mm GMV to 500m GMV</a>. This approach compliments the hunt for PMF because it get‚Äôs the testing and feedback loop going in multiple key communities at the same time.</p>
<p>The approach suggested in this proposal brings in governance talent from around the ecosystem, which can be leveraged to improve governance at home as well.</p>

            <p>This is an interesting idea and could be a fun experiment. But on the surface, I feel like we still have a lot to improve on coordinating governance within our own DAO, and keeping stewards engaged in general. I‚Äôm not sure we‚Äôre ready to add in governing other DAOs and vice versa.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Gitcoin has trended towards consolidating workstreams and creating leaner more efficient teams. I‚Äôm not sure this warrants an entire new workstream. Even with a novel approach, this feels like it mainly falls under biz dev and partnerships. So perhaps this could work better within an existing workstream (ie. PGF or the potential future GSD workstream *TBA).</p>

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/jengajojo">@jengajojo</a>, overall I think this proposal is well thought out and put together.</p>
<p>One clarification question is around the milestones</p>

<p>Effectively, the promise here is that for 100K GTC (about 90K USD) this initiative will be at the source of 3 DAOs adopting our products or funding the matching pool.</p>
<p>At first glance, that seems like a pretty low target. If Gitcoin to hire a FT sales person to do the same work, I am confident that they could fulfill a much higher target than that.</p>
<p>My main hesitation around accelerating our decentralization process is that we are still in a PMF-finding phase, and my understanding from reading time and time again is that decentralizing before finding PMF is a bad idea.</p>
<p>Otherwise, this seems like something we have never done before and sounds like it worked really well at Bankless.</p>

            <h2><a name="summary-1" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#summary-1"></a>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Trial run a meta-governance squad to spur adoption of the DAOs‚Äô products</li>
<li>Assist newbies and veterans with DAO2DAO governance</li>
<li>Compliment the <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/governance-roadmap-s19-20-beyond/16645">Governance Roadmap</a> by incentivizing community to play an active role governance strategy</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="abstract-2" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#abstract-2"></a>Abstract</h2>
<p>Metagovernance is the act of one DAO participating in the governance process of another through the use of a token. Further reading <a href="https://www.bankless.com/ultimate-guide-to-metagovernance" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a>.This proposal aims to establish a public meta-governance workstream with the goal of incentivizing and mentoring passionate contributors to understand and execute on a DAO2DAO governance strategy to accelerate adoption of the DAOs products in the wider crypto ecosystem. The milestone based meta-governance workstream will run over the course of 6 months which will involve a weekly sync, guidance and mentorship for contributors and performance based compensation using direct grants via Grants stack.</p>
<h2><a name="motivation-3" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#motivation-3"></a>Motivation</h2>
<p>The Gitcoin ecosystem, with its MMM, Product, and PGF Teams, is robust and driven towards enhancing the adoption of Gitcoin‚Äôs products. However, each of these groups lacks the expertise and support to effectively tap into the potential of DAO2DAO (D2D) collaborations. The question then arises: How can we optimise the returns on D2D collaborations to expedite product adoption, without giving the impression of engaging in zero-sum games?</p>
<p>Meta-governance has joined the chat‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Almost a year ago, BanklessDAO faced similar challenges. Vibes were low and product adoption was down. At this critical moment, the DAO approved <a href="https://forum.bankless.community/t/daostewards-funding-proposal/4755" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">a proposal to fund a meta-governance workstream</a>. Since then, the DAO was able to raise funds to</p>
<ol>
<li>50k to fund its <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0xb748c0fa726bb7c7051d474b9273147920d9a2119c9e062ac5231d3edc70f49e" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">humanitarian relief initiative</a> via 1inchDAO</li>
<li>Deliver a global <a href="https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-banklessdao-s-global-campaign-to-spread-the-optimistic-vision/6113" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">education and onboarding campaign</a> worth 100K for OptimismDAO</li>
<li><a href="https://forum.bankless.community/t/gitcoin-grants-round-18/8293/12" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">2x revenues</a> to over 25k from Gitcoin Grant Round</li>
<li>50k+ raised funds from other PGF projects like <a href="https://forum.bankless.community/t/optimism-rpfg2-distribution/5837" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">RPGF2</a>, <a href="https://discuss.octant.app/t/banklessdao-global-education-and-onboarding-for-cryptonatives/66" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Octant</a>, <a href="https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/0x59d79b22595b17af659ce9b03907615f53742c57/0x59d79b22595b17af659ce9b03907615f53742c57-7" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">ArbitrumFest</a> etc</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to accelerate product adoption and expand the quantity and quality of contributors, we, <a href="https://daoplomats.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">DAOplomats</a>, propose to establish and run a meta-governance workstream with the aim of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Facilitating the DAO2DAO governance conversation in Gitcoin</li>
<li>Drive adoption of gitcoin products in other DAOs</li>
<li>Secure funding for PGF (program rounds)</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="specification-4" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#specification-4"></a>Specification</h2>
<h4><a name="meta-governance-facilitation-5" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#meta-governance-facilitation-5"></a>Meta-governance Facilitation</h4>
<p>If this proposal is approved, the workstream will be kickstarted with a kickoff sync where we will assess the totality of external and internal talent, experience and availability of contributors as well as invite mulit-DAO delegates to join the conversation.We will work with existing stewards and members from core teams to hit the ground running from the get go. We will facilitate a weekly sync for all interested participants along with async chats to help participants in their journey.</p>
<p>Over the course of the program, stewards will be incentivized to participate in governance at other DAOs, gain reputation, increase voting weight, and leverage it to propose gitcoin‚Äôs products and services in those communities. The workstream will also invite multi-DAO delegates with pre-existing experience and reputation to assist the squad and accelerate positive outcomes.</p>
<p>We will not only focus on external governance but also assist existing and new contributors towards understanding and innovating on the <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/governance-roadmap-s19-20-beyond/16645">Governance Roadmap</a>, thus enabling a broader pool of talent to get highly engaged in Gitcoin governance.</p>
<p><strong>Signal your interest by adding your general availability <a href="https://lettucemeet.com/l/blEL2" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a>, so we can identify a time slot that fits most people</strong></p>
<h4><a name="retroactive-rewards-6" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#retroactive-rewards-6"></a>Retroactive rewards</h4>
<p>Stewards who actively participate will be eligible for retroactive compensation proportional to their results. We suggest that this performance driven compensation be proportional to</p>
<ul>
<li>size of funds raised for PGF (program rounds)</li>
<li>number of passports activated</li>
<li>number of DAOs adoption grants stack</li>
</ul>
<p>These payments will be done in the form of direct grants via Grants stack. This mechanism not only ensures that the right contributions are rewarded, but that the DAO continues using its products for its own benefit.</p>
<p>Active stewards will receive base compensation at the end of each milestone. Base compensation will be equally divided amongst all active stewards. The definition of active stewards as well as performance based compensation will be agreed with the participants and posted on the forum.</p>
<h5><a name="roadmap-towards-self-sustainability-7" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#roadmap-towards-self-sustainability-7"></a>Roadmap towards self-sustainability:</h5>
<p>There are several delegate compensation programs at <a href="https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-expansion-of-orbit-a-dao-funded-delegate-platform-initiative/14785" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Aave</a>, <a href="https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP61#abstain-modifier-motivation" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Maker</a>, <a href="https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-delegate-rewards-season-4/6878" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Optimism</a>, <a href="https://gov.1inch.io/discussion/11322-1ip-29-recognized-delegates-program" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">1inch</a> which yield an average of 3-5k/month/delegate in income for the participating group. Stewards who are sufficiently trained and motivated will not only be able fund themselves while helping Gitcoin with product adoption, but will create a long term value flow between DAOs and across the larger ecosystem, which will ultimately help us as a crypto community resist Moloch and unlock the potential of DAOs.</p>
