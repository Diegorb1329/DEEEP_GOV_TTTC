[GG21 Retrospective] Token Engineering the Superchain
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-retrospective-token-engineering-the-superchain/19375
    # Introduction

**Token Engineering the Superchain Grants Round: Summer/Fall 2024** was designed as a [dual-phase initiative](https://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/token-engineering-the-superchain-8a8acdca826b) to advance token engineering within the Optimism and broader Superchain ecosystems. The first phase, completed in August 2024, was a Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF) round aimed at funding high-potential projects. The second phase, a Retroactive Funding round, is scheduled for later this year to reward grantees based on completed milestones and demonstrated impact.

# Grant Round Objectives

The primary objectives of this grant round were to:

* **Advance Token Engineering field:** support projects that demonstrate potential to advance token engineering field and contribute to the OP and broader Superchain ecosystems.
* **Drive Superchain impact:** support initiatives with the potential to create measurable, positive effects within Optimism and its broader ecosystem.
* **Prepare for Retroactive funding round:** set the foundation for a follow-up Retro Round using Gitcoin’s RetroPGF platform, which will reward projects based on the milestone achievement and demonstrated impact.

# Grant Round Overview
* **Total donations:** $ 5,792.59
* **Number of contributions:** 914
* **Average contribution:** $ 16.6
* **Unique donors:** 349
* **Participating projects:** 18
* **Average grant size:** $ 3,333

The round focused on funding projects with strong alignment to both token engineering and OP ecosystem, selecting projects based on their potential to drive significant impact.

The grant round targeted projects advancing token engineering through various means, such as:
* **Tooling:** building tools and infrastructure that enhance token engineering practices within the Superchain.
* **Research and Education:** conducting research and creating educational resources to expand the understanding and application of token engineering.
* **Social Infrastructure and Consulting Services:** developing frameworks and offering services that support the community’s capacity to apply token engineering principles effectively.

# Setup and Management

The TQF round built on the lessons learned from previous rounds, further refining the [Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF)](https://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/expertise-and-quadratic-funding-bd4f0c5c3e23) approach. This round also introduced new criteria for evaluating the potential impact within the OP ecosystem. By incorporating token engineering expertise signals (TEA NFT credentials, $TEC holdings) and boosting them with Optimism Delegate, Badgeholder and $OP holdings as signals, TQF ensured funding aligned with stakeholders knowledgeable in both token engineering and OP ecosystems.

# Challenges and Solutions

1. **Volume of applications:** despite a more focused round, the unexpected volume of last-minute applications created challenges in evaluation. To address this, future rounds will consider increasing evaluation capacity by engaging more reviewers to manage the load more effectively.

2. **Superchain alignment:** many projects struggled to clearly articulate both token engineering relevance and OP ecosystem impact. We supported these grantees through application revisions but recognized that more upfront guidance might be needed in future rounds to help projects fully align with our goals.

3. **Time management and appeals:** the short timeline between application deadlines and the start of the donation period, combined with managing late appeals, stretched resources thin. Moving forward, we might consider separating the closing of applications from the donation period to better manage both processes.

### TEGR4 vs Token Engineering the Superchain- Project & Funding Changes

||TEGR4|Token Engineering the Superchain|Difference|% Change|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Total projects|32|18|-14|-44%|
|Recurring projects|9|11|2|22%|
|New projects|23|7|-16|-70%|
|Unique donors|554|349|-205|-37%|
|Total crowdfunded|$9,363.07|$5,792.59|-3570.48|-38%|
|Total contributions|1,579|914|-665|-42%|
|Average contribution|$ 16.9|$ 16.6|-0.3|-2%|

* **Total projects**: in the previous round (TEGR4), we had 32 projects, while the current round focused on OP/Superchain had 18 projects, reflecting a more selective approach aligned with OP ecosystem goals.
* **Unique donors:** the previous round had 554 donors, whereas this round saw a drop to 349, likely due to the more focused nature of the round.
* **Crowdfunding amount:** TEGR4 raised $9,363.07, while the current round raised $5,792.59, reflecting the narrower focus but also the strong support within the OP/Superchain community.
* **New projects:** in the previous round, there were 23 new projects, whereas this round saw only 7 new projects, as many returning projects already had ties to the OP/Superchain.
* **Average contribution:** both rounds had similar average contributions, around $16.9, indicating stable community engagement per donor.

### Conclusion:

While participation numbers and funding were lower compared to previous rounds, this was expected due to the more selective approach. Additionally, this round is only phase 1, with a follow-up retro round to come. The overall focus for this dual-round approach is to emphasize long-term impact and reward the progress made by grantees in the months to come.

# Lessons Learned and Next Steps

This round provided several valuable insights that will shape our approach to future grant rounds:

1. **Clearer guidance on Token Engineering & Superchain alignment:** we learned that some grantees struggled to articulate both token engineering relevance and their impact within the OP ecosystem. To address this in future rounds, we will:
  * Provide more detailed, upfront guidance and templates during the application phase to help grantees align their project goals with both token engineering and Superchain impact.
  * Host pre-application workshops or AMAs to clarify expectations and offer Q&A opportunities for prospective applicants.

2. **Managing last-minute applications:** the high volume of last-minute applications created a challenge in ensuring thorough evaluation. In future rounds, we will:
  * Expand the reviewer pool and ensure more time is allocated between the application deadline and the start of the donation period.

3. **Grantee marketing support**: several grantees did not fully leverage the opportunity to promote their projects and attract contributions. To improve this, we will:
  * Offer marketing toolkits and resources earlier in the process, including sample social media posts, graphics, and outreach strategies.
  * Provide incentives for projects to engage with the community to boost visibility and increase their chances of success.

4. **Refining impact metrics and evaluation criteria**: setting and tracking meaningful metrics has proven to be a challenge in terms of capturing both short-term milestones and long-term impact. To improve this, we will:
  * Implement clearer milestone-setting requirements that include both quantitative and qualitative impact metrics (e.g., community engagement, adoption rates, technical milestones).

This focus on refining guidance, streamlining processes, and enhancing grantee support will help us to improve our future rounds and create greater alignment between grantee projects and community priorities.

# Key Successes

Key Successes from the 2024 TQF Round:

* **Strong alignment with Superchain objectives:** despite being a more focused round, the projects selected demonstrated clear potential to impact both token engineering and the broader OP ecosystem.
* **Optimized use of Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF):** this round successfully built upon the TQF model, incorporating expertise signals from Optimism delegates and badge holders. This enhanced the quality of decision-making and ensured funding aligned with community priorities, demonstrating the power of fine-tuned quadratic funding mechanisms.
* **Increased returning grantees:** we saw a 22% increase in returning grantees, which indicates that previous participants continue to see value in our rounds. These returning projects showed strong progress and further alignment with OP ecosystem goals, solidifying their role as key contributors to both token engineering and Superchain.

# Next Steps: Preparing for Retroactive Funding Round
The Retro Round, scheduled for October- December, 2024 will use Gitcoin’s RetroPGF platform to allocate additional funding based on demonstrated impact. Grantees will need to submit reports and proof outlining:

1. Milestones achieved
2. Impact metrics

We are currently finalizing the timeline and milestones for the Retro Round and will keep all grantees informed as we approach the next phase.

# Collecting Grantee Feedback
We were unable to collect grantee feedback in time for this report but will collect detailed feedback as part of the Retroactive funding process to ensure continuous improvement in future grant rounds.

# Closing Thoughts
This round has shown that combining Quadratic Funding with Retroactive Funding presents an exciting opportunity for incentivizing long-term impact. We are committed to refining our approach and ensuring alignment with both token engineering and OP ecosystem.

 We look forward to the Retro Round, where we will continue this journey of funding impactful projects and rewarding meaningful outcomes.
