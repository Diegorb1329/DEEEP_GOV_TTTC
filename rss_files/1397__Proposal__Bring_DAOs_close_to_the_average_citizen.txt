[Proposal] Bring DAOs close to the average citizen, and let them open their eyes
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-bring-daos-close-to-the-average-citizen-and-let-them-open-their-eyes/4046
    With the last crash of bitcoin, cryptocurrencies have suffered a big dip. This has cause an incredible panic to retail investors and holders. It should not be like that as the block-chain technology has been accepted everywhere.

Why not give a little push for the normal retail investor and give them a token reward with value, but only can be use in Gitcoin to help fund other projects?
As the new individual starts learning, the reward would help understand the learner the potential for DAO in multiple areas to improve the world around us?
