GG20 Project Charter
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-project-charter/18307
    As described in https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/our-community-driven-engagement-framework-for-oss-rounds/18242 I am sharing here the Project Charter we have developed for GG20.  Big thanks to @MathildaDV @sejalrekhan @M0nkeyFl0wer @umarkhaneth and @meglister for feedback and help!

## Document Purpose

This document is the project charter for the GG20 OSS Round, spearheaded by Grant Ops in collaboration with the Ecosystem Collective and the wider Gitcoin Community. The purpose of this document is to outline the project scope, responsibilities, tasks, and timeline from inception through execution to post-project analysis and closure. This document aims to produce:

* A common understanding of the project's objectives, scope, and expected outcomes.
* An implementation strategy that will minimize issues and maximize client satisfaction.
* A reduction in implementation and operating risk through more effective planning.

Gitcoin will present this project charter for presentation and modification and allow all stakeholders the opportunity to provide feedback on the project's overall plan, the definition of success criteria, and further definition of granular project details (e.g., the commitment of specific resources, timelines, tasking, milestone definitions, and associated dates, etc.)

## Objectives

|Medium|Drawing < 50% from the matching pool|Equal (+/- 10%) $$$ total user contributions to the matching pool amount|Established program brand.|
|High|Did not draw from the matching pool.|Recurring/Trustless Funding|Competitive Offering. Creating inbound leads to fund.|

## Diversity and Quality of Projects/Grantees:

* Number and variety of Eth Infrastructure projects successfully integrated.
* Quality and innovativeness of projects, particularly in new segments like account abstraction.

## Funding Goals Achievement:

* At a minimum, $500K is reached.

## OSS Growth and Development:

* Measurable contributions of funded projects to Ethereum’s ecosystem growth.
* Number of high-impact OSS projects funded and their subsequent growth.

## Round Participation and Engagement:

* Increase quality applications and participants per round.
* Level of community engagement in providing feedback and suggesting innovations.

## Impactful Use of Funds:

* Success stories/case studies of how the increased time and funding between rounds have led to more significant impacts.

## Resourcing Plan

[OSS Round - Project DACI](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-m6GdjSArf8KZTGSVdbHHdkKiIxLSXM_NuI_1H2jzKk/edit#gid=0)

## Communications Plan

This plan integrates key project charter and DACI elements to create a communication strategy supporting project success and stakeholder engagement.

### Channels:

* Internal Communications: Utilize Discord for day-to-day communication, Notion for task documentation and project management, and Google Meet for regular team meetings.
* External Communications: Email updates via the “Momma Gitcoin” Twitter channel, Gitcoin blog, and other social media channels (Farcaster, Lens) will be used to keep the community informed. The [Gitcoin Grants Program Updates & Info Telegram](https://t.me/+W9y5_KplLX4xYjcx) Channel will be used for real-time engagement with the wider community, including general Q&A and support.

Comms Strategy for Grantees and Donors

* Email Communication with Grantees:
  * Email will be the primary mode of communication for the round. Schedule and send emails before, during, and after the funding round.
    * First comms start roughly a month before the round kicks off and a few weeks before applications open.
  * Maintain a weekly update cadence to set expectations for regular communications about the round.
* Communication of Key Dates and Information:
  * Communicate crucial deadlines, including application opening, early bird deadlines, and more.
  * Share essential information like access to the portal, tutorial links, marketing materials, and best practices guides. Note that the same content (with minor alterations) can be reused in multiple rounds.
  * Communicate daily RE: any necessary donor comms, including round dates, chain & bridging information, and more.
* Utilizing Telegram for Community Engagement:
  * These threads should offer support and encourage sharing best practices and ideas among grantees, fostering community and cross-pollination.
* Support and Collaboration Channels:
  * Leverage our dedicated Telegram thread to provide a platform for support. There will be a dedicated channel for OSS grantees.
  * Encourage grantees to share their experiences and insights, which can lead to mutual learning and collaboration.
  * Weekly Office Hours for further support
  * There will be an opportunity to onboard and temporarily employ community members to offer further support for GG20.
* Donor Support Channels:
  * We will direct all users to the Grants Stack Intercom Instance for support needs.

Grantee Applications/Reviews

* We will leverage [Checker](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-checker/17292) for Application Reviews.
* There will be an appeal process for applicants who like to request a second review.

### Frequency:

* Project Team: Structured meetings and check-ins will be scheduled weekly, as needed, leading up to GG20, and then daily stand-ups for stakeholders when the round launches.

### Keeping Stakeholders Informed and Involved:

* Regular Updates: Provide consistent, transparent updates on project progress, challenges, and achievements through structured meetings.
* Engagement Opportunities: Shared above in comms for grantees and donors.

### Evaluation and Adjustment:

* Regularly review the effectiveness of communication strategies, making adjustments as necessary based on stakeholder feedback and project evolution.

## Project Execution:

All Tasks related to the GG20 will be tracked internally using the project management systems we developed in Notion.

## Budget and Resources

The budget is $1M for the OSS Round. Any additional funds taken in up to $1M from funders will offset draws against the gitcoin.eth multisig.

## Conclusion

As we approach the implementation phase of the GG20 OSS Round, we wish to extend our gratitude to the entire Gitcoin community. Your active participation, insightful feedback, and support over the last 19 seasons of GG have been incredible. 

Through this collaborative spirit, we can continue to drive meaningful impact across the broader OSS Ecosystem.

LFG!

  <blockquote>
    Overview: Gitcoin is one of the longstanding players in the Ethereum ecosystem and is best known for its public goods funding program. The Gitcoin Grants Program started in 2019 and has distributed over $56M of funding to public goods that benefit Ethereum. It was one of the first and primary vehicles to test the revolutionary crowdfunding mechanism, Quadratic Funding. 
19 rounds later, we’re even more passionate about the role of grants in growing the Ethereum ecosystem and ensuring its success…
