A world where QF Enhances *Every* Income
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-world-where-qf-enhances-every-income/10202
    In the 90s, Microsoft had a goal to have a [PC on every desk](https://www.reliableplant.com/Read/2432/power-of-a-clear,-concise-vision).
I think that GitcoinDAO's goal is to have [QF enhance every income](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/why-i-am-holon-maximalist/10152).

*(Of course, I am one node in the network - Feel free to give feedback on the above statement or propose a different goal)*

After thinking this eventuality through, I wrote https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-vision-for-a-pluralistic-civilizational-scale-infrastructure-for-funding-public-goods/9503 , and @lthrift & @kevin.olsen have published https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-2-0/9981 , a vision of a credibly neutral protocol that anyone can deploy in order to run their own QF rounds, slated to be built this year.

There is a high order bit in this vision that I want to focus on in this post.  We have an important phase change coming up in Grants 2.0, which will allow the DAO to scale much faster. 

1. Grants 1.0 was Gitcoin Holdings (or GitcoinDAO) fishing for you.  üêü
2. Grants 2.0 is GitcoinDAO teaching you to fish. üé£üêüüêüüêüüêü

Grants 2.0 could allow us to *exponentially* scale Grants because were not the ones administering the QF rounds anymore.  As we scale, it is important to decouple the resources the DAO spends from the impact it creates.  Doing so enables more impact.   Checkout this graph from https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/grants-2-0-is-how-we-scale-our-impact/10015 to see what I mean:

Which leads me to the prompt:  
1. What would have to be true to pull the world towards an outcome where QF enhances every income?
2. What would have to be true for GitcoinDAO's matching partners to be ready to operate their own rounds?  
3. What would have to be true from a technology, design, marketing, communications perspective?  
4. What can we leverage about the behaviour of the matching partners now to be prepared to make them successful when Grants 2.0 launches?

A world where QF Enhances *Every* Income

            <p>Awesome post - that graph is such a great visual representation as to why the move to Grants 2.0 is critically important.</p>
<p>I love the vision of a world where QF enhances every income. In my depiction of that vision, Gitcoin Grants is certainly a staple - and the vision also includes other manisfestations of QF like <a href="https://pay.party/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">pay.party</a> and probably many others we haven‚Äôt begun to think of.</p>

</aside>
<p>From my Grants Ops perspective, I think the biggest thing is an ownership mindset.</p>
<p>Within our grants program today, we already see a wide spectrum of ecosystem rounds - we have some that seem to be super eager to fish for themselves and are coming up with innovations/structures on top of our platform that we couldn‚Äôt have imagined, and on the flip side, we have others whose behaviour suggests they want Gitcoin to do most of the fishing for them.</p>
<p>If we want partners to increasingly run their own rounds, we at Gitcoin should be making it clear to those potential round owners what a successful grants round looks like and how to run one themselves. We are gaining more evidence round-by-round on what works &amp; what doesn‚Äôt, and while we‚Äôve started on these efforts, we can certainly do a better job providing playbooks to partners.</p>
<p>You could also imagine a world in which, without Gitcoin in the loop, grants program leads across DAOs are sharing best practices &amp; teaching one another how to run rounds.</p>
<p>I am excited for this future and can‚Äôt wait to see how Grants 2.0 begins to enable it <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=12" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>Here is how I think about this problem visually.</p>
<ol>
<li>How can Gitcoin enable Ecosystem Builders to build their ecosystem?</li>
<li>By enabling the Ecosystem Builders to enable their best Grant Owners to raise more $$$.  How do they do that?</li>
<li>By enabling the contributors to give more $$$.  How do they do that?</li>
