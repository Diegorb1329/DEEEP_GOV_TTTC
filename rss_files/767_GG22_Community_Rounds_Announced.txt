https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg22-community-rounds-announced/19450
    ## GG22 Community Rounds Announced

We are thrilled to announce the Community Rounds that have been accepted into GG22! ICYMI, to be eligible to run a community round in GG22 and receive matching funds from Gitcoin, each community needed to [upload their proposal](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg22-community-rounds-eligibility-criteria/19330) to our gov forum by Sept 22.

The GG22 Community Council took 5 days to review and vote on which rounds to accept into the round, and how to allocate matching funds to each. The voting for which rounds to accept was conducted in CharmVerse, and was ranked according to average rubric scores. What changed in GG22? As per the [learnings from GG21](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-first-community-led-round-gg21-results-retrospective/19318), it was clear that we needed to increase quality and impact within the rounds we accept into GG rounds. Changes include: Stricter eligibility criteria, and it was up to the council‚Äôs discretion how many rounds would be accepted into the round, according to the quality of applications received, including how to allocate matching funds. High-quality rounds with previous round operator experience was essential for GG22.

Rubric that was used is the following:

**Round Operators and Team**

* Identified Round Operator
  * Clearly identified Round Operator with past experience of running a round?
* Team Members
  * At least two additional team members with previous experience to run a round?

**Fundraising**

* Matching Pool Impact
  * Matching pool size (that the community is bringing in) is proportional to what they are trying to achieve?

**Alignment with one of GG22 Intents**

Allo GMV (A round needs to reach 20% crowdfunding proportional to their matching pool. For example, if gitcoin provides $20k in matching the minimum amount of crowdfunding necessary would be $4K), Supporting builders building on top of Allo, Scaling and growing the Ethereum ecosystem

* Mission Alignment
  * Clearly aligns with one of Gitcoin‚Äôs GG22 Intents?

**Community and Impact**

* Community Size and Engagement
* Impact Assessment Plan
  * Detailed plan for assessing grantee impact?

**Voting Guidelines:**

* Each proposal is to be scored according to the rubric.
* Proposals with the highest average points will be prioritized.
* In case of ties, preference will be given to proposals with stronger alignment with GG22‚Äôs Intents and larger community engagement.

Thank you to everyone for applying to this round! It was great to see such a diverse set of applications for GG22. 

Thank you to the council @feems, @thedevanshmehta, @ZER8, @wasabi, @mashal, @azeem, @lanzdingz for your engagement and stewarding of this decision.

### Results

It was decided by the council that the funds would be split between the Top 7 rounds, with the $125k matching funds from Gitcoin split as follows:

* [BioFi Pathfinders](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg22-community-round-proposal-biofi-pathfinders/19399) - $20k
* [Ma Earth Grants Round 2](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg22-proposal-ma-earth-grants-round-2/19404) - $20k
* [ENS Ecosystem](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg22-community-round-proposal-ens/19400) - $20k
* [Allo Builders Advancement Round](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg22-community-round-proposal-allo-builders-advancement-round/19401) - $20k
* [Growing the Public Gardens](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg22-community-round-proposal-growing-the-public-gardens/19397) - $20k
* [Youth in Need](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg22-community-round-proposal-youth-in-need/19391) - $12.5k
* [Regen Citizen Round](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg22-community-round-proposal-regen-citizen-round/19402) - $12.5k

We are excited to have these rounds run alongside our OSS Program in GG22!

**NOTE:** Due to the fact that there was not adequate Round Operator experience within the Planetary Council round, with the only round they ran having had less than 10 donors, and the main funding went to their own project, the round was deemed ineligible to participate within GG22.

As we're gearing up for GG22, we will contact all round operators to begin the onboarding process for this round!

            <p>Hey!  Gitcoin grants beginner here!</p>
<p>Question: All this grant categories where the 125k fund is distributed means all the rounds that are  happening this year or is it like funds distributed to those projects to run their own grants?</p>
<p>If anyone knows I‚Äôd really appreciate the help!</p>

            <h1><a name="unsolicited-advice-1" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#unsolicited-advice-1"></a>Unsolicited advice</h1>
<h3><a name="h-1-telegram-group-2" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-1-telegram-group-2"></a><img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/one.png?v=12" title=":one:" class="emoji" alt=":one:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> Telegram group</h3>
<p>Each round operator without existing Telegram group should establish one.</p>
<p>A single group <strong>OR</strong> dedicated threads for things like shilling / techical support / gm / memes. Best of both worlds: start small and if the traffic overflows then decide. But definitely establish a direct line for grantees to ask questions.</p>
<h3><a name="h-2-independent-review-3" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-2-independent-review-3"></a><img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/two.png?v=12" title=":two:" class="emoji" alt=":two:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> Independent review</h3>
<p>Another piece of unsolicited advice is <strong>independence</strong> of the assessment. I know it is more convenient to operate on a single Google Sheet but it can lead to ‚Äúgroup think‚Äù and ratings / eligibility being influenced by seeing other answers. I strongly recommend <strong>independent</strong> ratings. Could be as simple as ‚Äúduplicate sheet‚Äù and ‚Äúenforcement on the social layer‚Äù by not looking how other rate the projects.</p>
<p><em>(this is high trust environment, people running the round know and trust each other)</em></p>
<h3><a name="h-3-honest-feedback-transparent-review-4" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-3-honest-feedback-transparent-review-4"></a><img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/three.png?v=12" title=":three:" class="emoji" alt=":three:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> Honest feedback / transparent review</h3>
<p>After independent review is reconciled, totally possible to remove the names of individual jurors and public the results in the spirit of transparency and integrity.</p>
<h3><a name="h-4-shill-it-forward-5" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-4-shill-it-forward-5"></a><img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/four.png?v=12" title=":four:" class="emoji" alt=":four:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> ‚Äúshill it forward‚Äù</h3>
<p>Something that works well (idea cross-pollinated from CCN) is ‚Äúshill it forward‚Äù. On the Twitter Spaces you are more than welcome to promote a project, it just cannot belongs to you.</p>
<h3><a name="h-5-extra-points-for-early-submission-6" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-5-extra-points-for-early-submission-6"></a><img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/five.png?v=12" title=":five:" class="emoji" alt=":five:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> Extra points for early submission</h3>
<p>Another idea cross-polinated from CCN is the bonus for early bird or penalty for late submissions. This is to ensure smooth (on time) acceptance</p>
<h3><a name="h-6-proposed-vs-retroactive-7" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-6-proposed-vs-retroactive-7"></a><img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/six.png?v=12" title=":six:" class="emoji" alt=":six:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> Proposed VS retroactive</h3>
<p>To avoid any potential future debates, worth stating explictly if the grant is for the proposed work or retroactive.</p>
<h3><a name="h-7-established-vs-new-8" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-7-established-vs-new-8"></a><img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/seven.png?v=12" title=":seven:" class="emoji" alt=":seven:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> Established VS new</h3>
<p>Sometimes there is a rule <em>‚Äúprojects neeed to be at least ‚Ä¶ old‚Äù</em></p>
<p>Sometimes you want to encourage new proposals, new ideas, from credible people with accountability and reputation.</p>
<p>Or maybe in order to establish project self-funding / bootstrapping / skin in the game required? Could be either, depending on circumstances and capital / time / energy / effort required to initiate a project.</p>
<h3><a name="h-8-apppeals-vs-decision-is-final-9" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-8-apppeals-vs-decision-is-final-9"></a><img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/eight.png?v=12" title=":eight:" class="emoji" alt=":eight:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> Apppeals VS decision is final?</h3>
<p>Maybe. Could be both. Finality means less work, less drama, faster turnaround.</p>

<p>This is to ensure ROI on time / energy / effort. Or maybe not? Currently I see GG rounds as popularity contest. But I also understand that good marketing is a good proxy for execution and real-life adoption. I recentlly flipped to like QF:</p>

<p>Super excited with all the proposed rounds, ease of usage of the rubric, and weighted average scoring makes it straightforward.</p>
<p>Best wishes for Rounds Operators and as always a joy to work with the Gitcoin Community Council.</p>

<p>We are thrilled to announce the Community Rounds that have been accepted into GG22! ICYMI, to be eligible to run a community round in GG22 and receive matching funds from Gitcoin, each community needed to <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg22-community-rounds-eligibility-criteria/19330">upload their proposal</a> to our gov forum by Sept 22.</p>
<p>The GG22 Community Council took 5 days to review and vote on which rounds to accept into the round, and how to allocate matching funds to each. The voting for which rounds to accept was conducted in CharmVerse, and was ranked according to average rubric scores. What changed in GG22? As per the <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-first-community-led-round-gg21-results-retrospective/19318">learnings from GG21</a>, it was clear that we needed to increase quality and impact within the rounds we accept into GG rounds.

<p>We are excited to have these rounds run alongside our OSS Program in GG22!</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Due to the fact that there was not adequate Round Operator experience within the Planetary Council round, with the only round they ran having had less than 10 donors, and the main funding went to their own project, the round was deemed ineligible to participate within GG22.</p>
<p>As we‚Äôre gearing up for GG22, we will contact all round operators to begin the onboarding process for this round!</p>
