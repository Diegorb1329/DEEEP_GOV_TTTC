# **TL;DR**
**WTF is Conviction Voting?**
[1Hive](https://1hive.gitbook.io/gardens/on-chain-governance/garden-framework/conviction-voting) built the first instance of a super handy tool called Conviction Voting.

>**If you haven't heard of it, here's the [TL;DR tweet thread](https://twitter.com/commonsstack/status/1309211776425365510).**

![image|535x467](upload://9ntoty5aIIcDeiEdy9ptEl9ADiI.jpeg)

**The Problem:**
Many DAOs (including Gitcoin) are struggling hard with the same problems: Insurmountable overhead with [keeping up with and voting on every proposal](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/governance-proposals/5), all or nothing (1 or 0 analog) funding proposals votes [like this one](https://twitter.com/muninn23/status/1501194712203640836) where there is significant support but not quorum, [last minute vote swings](https://twitter.com/j0hnwang/status/1489756724613373956) and other governance "attack" vectors that require time weighted voting to correct and more..

**A Solution:**
The DAO buidler tool box ***must* have Conviction Voting** to more efficiently distribute & decentralize funding proposals and visualize dynamic average consensus signals. 

The consent, rather than consensus based tool can help:
* Increase operational efficiency
* Mitigates many governance "attack" vectors

 *(Addressing plutocracy will require SSIDs/DIDs to scale in a meaningful way - I'm sure it won't be long!)* 

## Oh and did I forget to mention it provides rich data streams of continuous preference signals?

**Who Am I (Reputation Flags)**
I am a [Founding member of the FDD Working Group](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-fraud-detection-and-defense-working-group-assemble/158/18), Token Engineering & Governance Researcher at [BlockScience](https://block.science/), Advisor & Course Author at the [Token Engineering Academy](https://tokenengineeringcommunity.github.io/website/docs/academy-welcome/), [Trusted Seed](https://medium.com/giveth/the-trusted-seed-of-the-commons-stack-5af6fb04cd30) Member of the [CommonsStack](https://commonsstack.org/), Ground Control at the [Governauts](https://twitter.com/GovernanceDAO) & Founding Steward of the [Token Engineering Commons](http://tecommons.org/).

**Why We Need Moonshot's Support**
My colleague, TE OG @jeffemmett & I have been chatting with @owocki and several others about the need to expand and create a public good, chain agnostic version of this tool. 

I tried to rally some groups last year to fund/build this initiative but they all wanted their own version, to which the incredibly amazing, talented & busy lead engineer/developer of CV said, "Hey guys, I can't support 20 versions, let's build this in RUST." To which the groups said, "If we fund it, we want our way." 

*So, this is where the heroes of Gitcoin DAO & Moonshot Collective come in -  the pan-ultimate supporters of public goods!* üòç

## **Okay, I üíòit, Now What?**
One note before I let you go - this tool is customizable: 
![image|690x388](upload://2UHXOfCqJ9EdlOEbbJ5aRTa2xiV.jpeg)

So, we can build something for funding, for continuous [general signaling or ranking like a continous TCR](https://twitter.com/jeffemmett/status/1500863021605916676) - we definitely would need lots of discussion and some research with developers to figure out what would be the best, high leverage lego version that multiple DAOs could build on. 

So, don't be shy and let's crank up the conversation on this thread - pass to your friends :smiley: and **let's get the VC in the pipeline for the MC**, who can be a hero for all DAOs - and build the chain agnostic version of Conviction Voting that we all need! ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è HOORAY!!! ü•≥

*NOTE: @jeffemmett & I are available (limited bandwidth) to support R&D and would also love to see some resources (a few others / CV team) to continue to expand content/education/research/documentation of these concepts/tooling/R&D üôè Thank you so much for reading and in advance, for your thoughts & support! üíöü§ñ*

            <p>Thank you so much <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/pop">@Pop</a> <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/lthrift">@lthrift</a> for your time and meeting with us <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/pray.png?v=12" title=":pray:" class="emoji" alt=":pray:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"><br>
We agree that‚Äôs a great direction and would be a really cool tool for the space!</p>
<p>To share a few more notes from the meeting - it could also (eventually) be a composite system where Gitcoin DAO uses Conviction Voting for proposal funding for Capital Expenses and develops a new Conviction Funding Flow mechanisms for flowing salaries &amp; ongoing costs (Operational Expenses).</p>
<p>FROM MEETING NOTES:<br>
An OpEx Conviction Funding Flow Tool would:<br>
-Removes the BINARY ‚Äúfunds‚Äù or ‚Äùno funds‚Äù of proposals, and moves towards sliding scale of funds unlocked - like a dam opening with proportional amounts of water flowing according to tokens.<br>
-w/ configuration to correlate staking/threshholds with %s of the budget, rather than all or nothing - i.e. stewards agree w/ 80% of the budget, 80% unlocked while discussing/debating the other 20% so work can keep going</p>
<p>Here is documentation of a mechanism Sem from 1hive and some others have been working on, that may be useful for the developers in looking at what primitives/code exists for building a tool like this:</p>
<p>Osmotic Funding<br>
<a href="https://showcase.ethglobal.com/ethonline2021/osmotic-funding" class="inline-onebox">Osmotic Funding ¬∑ ETHGlobal Showcase</a><br>
<a href="https://github.com/BlossomLabs/osmotic-funding" class="inline-onebox">GitHub - BlossomLabs/osmotic-funding: Superfluid + Conviction Voting</a><br>
<a href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/4503/osmotic-funding" class="inline-onebox">Osmotic Funding | Grants | Gitcoin</a></p>
<p>There are other flow funding tools i.e. Radicle Drips, but they don‚Äôt have a conviction voting mechanism, so would be a really interesting and incredibly useful for many DAOs to have a tool combining these primitives‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Thank you again and look forward to next steps and supporting <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/pray.png?v=12" title=":pray:" class="emoji" alt=":pray:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p>Quick update for everyone here: <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/lthrift">@lthrift</a> and I met with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/jessicazartler">@JessicaZartler</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/jeffemmett">@jeffemmett</a> to discuss what the most pressing application/POC might be in the context of GD.</p>
<p>My view is that we should focus on something that enables a 20/80 split in voting for budgets where if a small % of a proposal is disputed, it can continue to be discussed vs either holding up the whole proposal or meaning the full amount gets passed even though some stewards may still have reservations around it or require further clarification.</p>
<p>Next steps: <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/lthrift">@lthrift</a> and I are synching to establish what work might look like for Moonshot/the research team</p>

<p>Osmotic Funding is an interesting modification of CV that may be more useful for continuous Operational Expenses (OpEx) like staff salaries or working group budgets, rather than more discrete proposals for Capital Expenses (CapEx) like one off projects, etc.</p>
<p>There are several interesting use cases for variations of the CV tool - eager to see how &amp; where they may find PMF in GitcoinDAO! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/pray.png?v=12" title=":pray:" class="emoji" alt=":pray:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/partying_face.png?v=12" title=":partying_face:" class="emoji" alt=":partying_face:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p>I got familiar with conviction voting at the Token Engineering Commons and I am a big fan.  We should absolutely consider its application here at Gitcoin.  No matter if we can make it fit OKR boxes or not.  CV is like a real-time signalling mechanism.  One lessor known feature of CV is that votes have a half-life much like a radioactive element.  This metric gets set in advance and determines the period of time after-which, a vote begins decomposing.  Signals do not last forever.  I wonder if CV could be used to make steward voting more powerful and timely.</p>

<p>1 concern is that the type of decisions that are ideal for CV (long game strategic/organizational direction decisions) might not match the type of decisions that Gitcoin Stewards vote on (regularly scheduled, short interval budgetary/steering decisions). It‚Äôs possible that CV could change the way stewards vote, could change the way Workstreams propose. But it‚Äôs also possible that the types of proposals &amp; mode of interacting with them would be too disparate and CV would gather dust living in Gitcoin‚Äôs governance system.</p>

<p>I see the CPK as a toolset. You might not use a hammer to screw in a socket, but you still need it in the tool kit! It would be up for the workstreams to decide when to use it.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not a major mandate of Gitcoin‚Äôs mission. So in order to find alignment to put development work towards this we‚Äôd need to see why building chain-agnostic Conviction Voting helps serve the mission of Gitcoin (which is to provide Public Goods Funding infrastructure) thru achieving our <em>current</em> OKRs</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I see these tools as force multipliers. They enable ecosystems rather than individuals. It seems to me that the potential to improve resource allocation, especially to public goods, is vastly greater through core primitives than through pounding out product to achieve OKRs.

Love this form of inter-DAO suggesting thru the forum!<br>
As a Commons Stacker, I‚Äôve spent a lot of time with CV (and Jeff and Jess!) and I agree that it‚Äôs:</p>
<ul>
<li>a necessary piece of the DAO tooling stack</li>
<li>full of potential to liberate society from ills of static voting</li>
<li>capable of increasing legitimacy &amp; engagement in Gitcoin Steward voting</li>
</ul>
<p>This last point I see as the major benefit to Gitcoin‚Äôs mission. So we must investigate it <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/nerd_face.png?v=12" title=":nerd_face:" class="emoji" alt=":nerd_face:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> 1 concern is that the type of decisions that are ideal for CV (long game strategic/organizational direction decisions) might not match the type of decisions that Gitcoin Stewards vote on (regularly scheduled, short interval budgetary/steering decisions). It‚Äôs possible that CV could change the way stewards vote, could change the way Workstreams propose. But it‚Äôs also possible that the types of proposals &amp; mode of interacting with them would be too disparate and CV would gather dust living in Gitcoin‚Äôs governance system. I‚Äôm curious to hear what <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/pop">@Pop</a> thinks as steward engagement is truly her domain.</p>
<p>Knowing where Gitcoin &amp; Moonshot Collective are at, I don‚Äôt see us being focused on providing DAO tooling in the near future. It‚Äôs not a major mandate of Gitcoin‚Äôs mission. So in order to find alignment to put development work towards this we‚Äôd need to see why building chain-agnostic Conviction Voting helps serve the mission of Gitcoin (which is to provide Public Goods Funding infrastructure) thru achieving our <em>current</em> OKRs: <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/2022-roadmap-2022-goals/9613" class="inline-onebox">2022 Roadmap &amp; 2022 Goals</a></p>

            <p>To add to this (admittedly, with fewer memes <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/cry.png?v=12" title=":cry:" class="emoji" alt=":cry:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">): Conviction Voting in its present form is geared towards easing fund allocations in DAOs, which is a great use case and is likely to ease some of these kinds of funding decisions.  It could also be augmented with <strong>quadratic</strong> conviction voting, or perhaps even <strong>quadratic downvoting</strong> on CV proposals, to provide the capability for a DAO to express negative sentiment towards CV proposals, if there was a concern that too many proposals were passing too easily.  There is still a wide design space to explore in the use of these new tools, and we‚Äôre interested to see how they can be iterated &amp; improved!</p>
<p>On top of CV for fund allocation, there are also discussions about a CV-variation called <span class="hashtag">#ConvictionRanking</span>, which could act more like a continuous TCR (token curated registry). If this were created with a ‚ÄòBYO token‚Äô design, any DAO could plug in their native token and allow any token holder to surface &amp; vote on anything they see needing improvement in the DAO.  It could be a sort of ‚Äúdigital suggestion box‚Äù which curates &amp; surfaces the most popular sentiments for action in a continuous, distributed &amp; asynchronous manner.  I got the sense that GitcoinDAO would benefit from such a tool (as well as vanilla Conviction Voting for fund allocation!) when I came across a tweet convo between <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a> &amp; <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/disruptionjoe">@DisruptionJoe</a>: <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffemmett/status/1499784633747054592" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://twitter.com/jeffemmett/status/1499784633747054592</a></p>

<h1><a name="tldr-1" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#tldr-1"></a><strong>TL;DR</strong></h1>
<p><strong>WTF is Conviction Voting?</strong><br>
<a href="https://1hive.gitbook.io/gardens/on-chain-governance/garden-framework/conviction-voting">1Hive</a> built the first instance of a super handy tool called Conviction Voting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If you haven‚Äôt heard of it, here‚Äôs the <a href="https://twitter.com/commonsstack/status/1309211776425365510">TL;DR tweet thread</a>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/4/41baddc5f1b0cc85c2d5f244de21e6b5c522e574.jpeg" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="9ntoty5aIIcDeiEdy9ptEl9ADiI" width="535" height="467"></p>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong><br>
Many DAOs (including Gitcoin) are struggling hard with the same problems: Insurmountable overhead with <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/governance-proposals/5">keeping up with and voting on every proposal</a>, all or nothing (1 or 0 analog) funding proposals votes <a href="https://twitter.com/muninn23/status/1501194712203640836">like this one</a> where there is significant support but not quorum, <a href="https://twitter.com/j0hnwang/status/1489756724613373956">last minute vote swings</a> and other governance ‚Äúattack‚Äù vectors that require time weighted voting to correct and more‚Ä¶</p>
<p><strong>A Solution:</strong><br>
The DAO buidler tool box <strong><em>must</em> have Conviction Voting</strong> to more efficiently distribute &amp; decentralize funding proposals and visualize dynamic average consensus signals.</p>
<p>The consent, rather than consensus based tool can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase operational efficiency</li>
<li>Mitigates many governance ‚Äúattack‚Äù vectors</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why We Need Moonshot‚Äôs Support</strong><br>
My colleague, TE OG <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/jeffemmett">@jeffemmett</a> &amp; I have been chatting with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a> and several others about the need to expand and create a public good, chain agnostic version of this tool.</p>
<p>I tried to rally some groups last year to fund/build this initiative but they all wanted their own version, to which the incredibly amazing, talented &amp; busy lead engineer/developer of CV said, ‚ÄúHey guys, I can‚Äôt support 20 versions, let‚Äôs build this in RUST.‚Äù To which the groups said, ‚ÄúIf we fund it, we want our way.‚Äù</p>
<p><em>So, this is where the heroes of Gitcoin DAO &amp; Moonshot Collective come in -  the pan-ultimate supporters of public goods!</em> <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/heart_eyes.png?v=12" title=":heart_eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":heart_eyes:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>So, we can build something for funding, for continuous <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffemmett/status/1500863021605916676">general signaling or ranking like a continous TCR</a> - we definitely would need lots of discussion and some research with developers to figure out what would be the best, high leverage lego version that multiple DAOs could build on.</p>
