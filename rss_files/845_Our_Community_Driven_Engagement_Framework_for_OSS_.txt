Our Community-Driven Engagement Framework for OSS Rounds
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/our-community-driven-engagement-framework-for-oss-rounds/18242
    We're always looking to improve our engagement with our community, prioritizing transparency, efficiency, and active participation.

As such, our revitalized approach to designing and managing the GG20 OSS Round will unfold in three phasesâ€”Crafting Agreements in the Open, Services Delivery with Community Oversight, and Project Closeout & Community Feedback.  Below, we detail how each phase integrates community-driven proposals, oversight, and feedback:

### Phase 1: Crafting Agreements in the Open

* Community-Driven Proposals: The agreement phase for OSS Rounds is conducted transparently on our governance forum. A prime example is the [GG Proposed Updates](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-proposed-updates/17649) post, where community feedback and discussions helped shape the proposal.
* Community Acceptance and Voting: The proposal is finalized through a [Snapshot Vote](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0xbd01ecc46afe5403bc9d5bd8ea960ba536ec8573b2b8abbc5a2687faf797b836), with acceptance from the community.

### Phase 2: Services Delivery with Community Insight

* OSS Charter: We will soon publish the OSS Charter, following the same approach to delivering our services. We hope to hear from all of you about that document, so stay tuned!
* Project Tracking: A public Notion site will be the central hub for project tracking, making the project's progress transparent and accessible to all community members. This will be shared in the coming days.

### Phase 3: Project Closeout & Community Feedback

* Reporting and Review: The closeout process includes publicly sharing a round report and conducting an after-action review in the forum. This ensures that learnings and next steps are openly discussed.
* Incorporating Learnings: Insights and feedback from the community are integral to refining our processes. Integrating these learnings into our practices ensures that Gitcoin Grants OSS Rounds remain efficient and community-focused.

### Why This Matters

Our open-process approach ensures accountability and empowers the community to contribute actively to the ongoing evolution of Gitcoin Grants. At the core of our operations, the community's involvement is not just valuedâ€”it's vital.
