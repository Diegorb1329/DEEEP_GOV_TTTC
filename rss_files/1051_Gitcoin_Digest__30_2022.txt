# 🔥 Hot Topics:

* From August 12th to August 19th, [8 new stewards](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-stewards-governance/41/234) expressed their interest in governing Gitcoin. One of them, [shawn16400](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/shawn16400/summary), is a new DAO Core member. The other 7 are all from [Consensys-Mesh](https://www.mesh.xyz/). They include two Partners, an Executive Assistant, a Head of Marketing, a Marketing Manager, a Talent Advisor, and a Portfolio Analyst. [From 2017 to 2021](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-brief-history-of-gitcoin-from-2017-2022/9431), Consensys-Mesh incubated Gitcoin then after Gitcoin raised enough funds to spin out, ConsenSys [sat on the board of directors](https://decrypt.co/66541/ethereum-gitcoin-raises-11-million-spins-out-consensys). In addition to incubating companies, ConsenSys Mesh runs the [Tachyon Accelerator](https://tachyon.xyz/), manages an [investment portfolio](http://mesh.xyz/portfolio), and participates in DAO governance.

* [Kyle](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l3ca8p9QKgS03pFQIMxyHqiyMtJmEEa3CuoiM_4oqXw/edit#), [Annika](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ecmGcpf_R3yjaK_n6bINPNIZK-GcVYVj1eSaFXDXMjw/edit), [Lindsey](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eCgIDna_9NFzR0yaNJpjxDDQ1OlBZV_ktPwMTbkjEIU/edit), and [Nate](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qeqZ6lOBgl7cs-_WwHBTTqvbseiTVgjY6iPy74f6jCQ/edit) [shared their voter guides for season 15](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s15-voters-guide-compendium-of-voters-guides/11310). All four guides highlight the market conditions forcing leaner workstream budgets and a desire to see improved performance from some struggling workstreams.

* [Elliott](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/elliott/summary) from [Llama](https://llama.xyz/) shares [Gitcoin’s July 2022 Financial Report](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-financial-reporting/8867/39). Gitcoin’s treasury remains over 99% GTC worth over $88MM. This month’s contributor rewards totaled $834.7k up 6.1% from last month. With GPC entering the budget in August, at an anticipated 36.4% of the DAO Budget, the total contributor rewards are expected to increase despite leaner workstreams.

* In a lucid [post about plural passports](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/plural-passports-without-literally-plural-passports/11341), [llllvvuu](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/llllvvuu), asks “if I have stamps from all of {PoH, Worldcoin, Idena, Bright ID, KYC, Web2}, what is the incentive for me to put all of these on the same passport, versus creating multiple passports?” He then explains that if rewards for adding more credentials to a passport level off, then there is an incentive to hold multiple passports. This could be prevented by credentialing systems, like Worldcoin and BrightID, linking identities across systems to verify that a person does not hold multiple identities.

* [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary) makes a post on the [Gitcoin Hyperstructure](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-gitcoin-hyperstructure/11335) which details three phases of Gitcoin’s coordination evolution. “Gitcoin started as socialware” with high social coordination costs and utilizing the primary mechanism of human relationships. Gitcoin is evolving more trustware which use technology to have low social coordination costs. The final form will be a hyperstructure: “a crypto protocol that can run for free and forever, without maintenance, interruption or intermediaries.”

# [🧙‍♂️🧙‍♀️ Workstream Discussion](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/workstream-discussion/9):

## 🌱 [Public Goods Funding](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Public-Goods-4ccd579f433c4dff9d8952314468d6e8)

* Our partners have already committed **over $2.6 million** in total matching funds for GR15 across the Main Round, 4 Cause Rounds ($900k+ matching pool) & 13 Ecosystem Rounds ($1.3M+ matching pool). More partners continue to sign on every day and we expect this total to keep growing!

* We’ve [published guidance](https://gitcoin.co/blog/level-up-your-grant-for-gr15/), in partnership with MMM, for grant creators. Grant creators should submit their new applications or updates by Sept 3rd at midnight CDT to receive a thorough review before the start of the round. The first days of the round are critical for raising the most funds!

## [🚀](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-prototyping-workstream-moonshot-budget-request-q4-2021/8785) [Moonshot Collective](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Moonshot-Collective-ffa78f44a0de412cb607f9b69d3a376f)

* We shipped **two identity staking stamps** that were successfully merged into the Passport codebase. This is a huge step toward Sybil resistance by enabling self-staking and community-staking on an individual’s identity. Now, we’re focused on upgrading our front-end design for the staking app and auditing our smart contracts.

* We identified **three themes for our workstream** to build success processes: cross-stream accountability, initiative accountability, and idea intake/vetting. Our team is developing proposals to address these.

## 💙 [Fraud Detection & Defense](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Fraud-Detection-Defense-2bde13c0b8e74fda81435d94e49e2703)

* We [**identified 1,121 likely Sybil Attackers**](https://discord.com/channels/562828676480237578/890335261580488744/1007713604159688784) based on their history of grant contributions and usernames. These accounts can be squelched to prevent influencing the matching fund while still accepting their “generous” donation :)

* We’re diving deep into how we can open up our data to be maximally useful for Grants 2.0. We’re also exploring how we can host a hackathon post-GR15 for data analysis.

## 🎨 [Merch, Memes & Marketing](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Merch-Memes-and-Marketing-60cc693f0fe14be1879a05587922c8a3)

* We’re significantly amping up our Grants Round Marketing for GR15! We **completed a runbook and tracker** to support our Partners’ Marketing efforts. We also created Twitter and email campaigns and are preparing a lot of content!

* We dropped an educational and entertaining Web3 Identity series on our blog. Check them out:
  * [Web 3 Identity 101: Episode 1 Sybil Attacks](https://gitcoin.co/blog/web3-identity-101-episode-1/)
  * [Web3 Identity 101: Episode 2 DID & VCs](https://gitcoin.co/blog/web3-identity-101-episode-2)
  * [Streamlining Sybil Defense for Gitcoin Grants with Gitcoin Passport](https://gitcoin.co/blog/streamlining-sybil-defense)

* One of our top priorities is protocol **product marketing**. We’re making sure we have descriptive names for each product, building a landing page for Gitcoin Passport, and aligning on a marketing plan for a key partnership.

## ☀️ [DAO Operations](https://gitcoin.notion.site/DAO-Ops-84f425e281ae49579a2b4acf0bad5dd5)

* **People Ops**: We developed documentation for converting GTC and are developing guidance on employment benefits through Opolis and WorkDAO. In addition, we are discussing how we can improve the peer review process for contributors based on workstream feedback.

* [**CSDO**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWEiZu1Jqkqn-axtQdtrNLg): In this week’s CSDO meeting, we discussed updates to the [passed vote](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0x0eb45cfd31ddd2701af3d74ce38a9e87292fe42a6b40b26812ff9889b07daeb3) to diversify $3MM of GTC into stablecoin. We have ~$3.8MM in our portfolio currently and CSDO voted to continue diversifying the surplus rather than returning it to the treasury. Additionally, our DAO-wide Tuesday Syncs are increasingly becoming a place for deeper dives and we’re looking to continue/expand this trend. We also discussed updating the gitcoin.co website and how FDD can help ensure that PGF has the data they need in a Grants 2.0 future.

## 🛠 [Gitcoin Product Collective](https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/Grants-2-0-f2860138cbb24505b5cb2d8576119a78)

* [**Round Manager**](https://gitcoin.notion.site/8b236ac027b3459e91e429888a57b4aa?v=fc7a415181fa41d19e4acba2ccb77884): We **deployed to a [production](https://round-manager.gitcoin.co/) environment**, and [demoed](https://share.vidyard.com/watch/PcHf5xvgZzdWMjqhEdeqHT?) the completed bulk approve/reject feature of our project. We also completed an internal design sprint for Grant Explorer and will be gathering user feedback before we build out our MVP.

* [**Grants Hub**](https://gitcoin.notion.site/18fe2a4947274d4db70f7d3714d0a931?v=3088537ab7794279a05c456b4e746f83): As of our [latest demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pHJ7aFnBiifH9HNa_4uXXZ1lajtOEf3G/view?usp=sharing), we are **90% complete** with Phase 2 of Grants Hub. Last week, we improved the UX by adding image cropping and developing new designs for payout wallet address validation. This week, we are finalizing the cryptographic security of PII data in our Round Manager integration, and conducting research interviews with new users.

Gitcoin’s treasury remains over 99% GTC worth over $88MM. This month’s contributor rewards totaled $834.7k up 6.1% from last month. With GPC entering the budget in August, at an anticipated 36.4% of the DAO Budget, the total contributor rewards are expected to increase despite leaner workstreams.</p>

<p>In a lucid <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/plural-passports-without-literally-plural-passports/11341">post about plural passports</a>, <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/llllvvuu">llllvvuu</a>, asks “if I have stamps from all of {PoH, Worldcoin, Idena, Bright ID, KYC, Web2}, what is the incentive for me to put all of these on the same passport, versus creating multiple passports?” He then explains that if rewards for adding more credentials to a passport level off, then there is an incentive to hold multiple passports. This could be prevented by credentialing systems, like Worldcoin and BrightID, linking identities across systems to verify that a person does not hold multiple identities.</p>

Gitcoin is evolving more trustware which use technology to have low social coordination costs. The final form will be a hyperstructure: “a crypto protocol that can run for free and forever, without maintenance, interruption or intermediaries.”</p>

<p>We shipped <strong>two identity staking stamps</strong> that were successfully merged into the Passport codebase.
