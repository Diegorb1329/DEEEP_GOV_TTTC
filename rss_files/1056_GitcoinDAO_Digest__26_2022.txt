## üëâ Key actions for this week:

1. Vote on [Gitcoin Product Collective‚Äôs Workstream Proposal & Budget Request for Season 15](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0xc6309348f43ba77bb488d2d5f154db3264f86a890b500fa8286fe089c6ddc9a0)!

## üî• Hot Topics:

* [Gitcoin Product Collective's Budget Proposal](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s15-proposal-gitcoin-product-collective-workstream-proposal-budget-request/11058/) garners support and drums up excitement across much of the DAO. Some stewards comment on the high budget being requested ($1.44M when including 60 days reserves) but declare that it‚Äôs well worth it for the future of Gitcoin. Additionally, [Lindsey](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/lthrift/summary) shares a [deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EL6pFKLmCF-brrg2xbcMBnFjweOM0wvyRrMVwv-YJ6o/edit#slide=id.gf411f49384_0_0) with details about how the team will seek partners to help design the future of the protocol.

* [Schelling Point Event Workstream Setup Proposal](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/schelling-point-event-workstream-setup-proposal/11083) receives widespread support from members and stewards within the DAO with several people raising the question ‚Äúwhat is a workstream lite?‚Äù. [Simona](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/pop/summary) answers: ‚Äúessentially it means that it does not carry bulk. It is an agile, streamlined workstream that comes together twice a year then dissipates and that it funds itself. There will be no budget proposals from this workstream.‚Äù

* [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary) invites the community to [provide feedback](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-should-i-change-my-delegations-q2-2022/10828/4) on how he should update his delegations in an effort to create more transparency and provides his [tentative updates](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-should-i-change-my-delegations-q3-2022/11132). [Kyle](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle/summary) also shares his [updated steward delegations](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-should-i-change-my-delegations-q2-2022/10828/6) for Season 15. Both delegations reflect a shfit toward emphasizing Grants 2.0 and the leadership of Lindsey Thrift and Kevin Olsen.

* In Llama‚Äôs [Gitcoin Treasury Runway Analysis](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-treasury-runway-analysis/11077/10), [myceliumcoordinator](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/myceliumcoordinator/summary) and [epowell101](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/epowell101/summary) enter the fray to criticize the analysis for not doing enough. Coordinator requests an analysis that includes different confidence intervals for each outcome. Powell points out that the analysis assumes the treasury has a static value of $134M when the current circulating supply of GTC is only $32M and says ‚Äúthere is no way that our treasury can actually be worth 4-5x the entire circulating market cap.‚Äù

* Owocki updates on the result of his request for [Impact Certificate Proposals](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/impact-certificates-proposals-wanted/10499/29). The top 5 proposals each won a $2k reward. Congratulations to Digital Gaia, Protein, Ethelo/Ashoka, Impact Oracle, and Crowdmuse! Gitcoin is also ‚Äúin the early stages of forming a partnership with Protocols Labs‚Äù to identify how Gitcoin Grants, Impact Certificates, and other primitives can be a part of a thriving public goods funding ecosystem.

* [Ben](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/bendi/summary) from [ScopeLift](https://www.scopelift.co/) [introduces flexible voting](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-flexible-voting-an-extension-to-the-governor-enabling-new-voting-mechanisms/11115), ‚Äúan extension to the Governor contracts that enables delegates to split their voting weight across For, Against, and Abstain on any given proposal‚Äù

* Check out [the latest episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVEP0zAK-xQ&t=1s) of the [Green Pill Podcast](http://availableon.com/greenpill), where Kevin Owocki brings on [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbEtzX1J2Tjh6SlJIZERYWVZhYjZ0aGVYa1BqQXxBQ3Jtc0trUnFsb0pfa2lBVmJGSFBLaTRJd0ZYUndlZVFVTFVtZXBPVTBqcHYwcjRjLThIYm9XQlBWbEVwZW9qRHplY09Cekh6dzViVDl2UjVjb3hMLUloemFfajd0b2N5cEhHQXF2XzNhTlhXVmtXbE5JdmFyQQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fcivilizationemerging.com%2Fabout%2F&v=WVEP0zAK-xQ), a founding member of [the consilience project](https://consilienceproject.org/).

    * Result: Passed

## [üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Workstream Discussion](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/workstream-discussion/9)

### üå± [Public Goods Funding](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Public-Goods-4ccd579f433c4dff9d8952314468d6e8)

* On July 15th, we officially made GR14 matching funds [available for grantees to claim](https://gitcoin.co/grants/matching_funds).

* We‚Äôre gearing up for GR15 by locking down matching fund partners and outlining a clear strategy and timeline for our operations.

### [üöÄ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-prototyping-workstream-moonshot-budget-request-q4-2021/8785) [Moonshot Collective](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Moonshot-Collective-ffa78f44a0de412cb607f9b69d3a376f)

* Governance Operations Scaling: We‚Äôve made the difficult decision to put this initiative on pause. Although we still see value in building a tool that enables fluid, granular, and informed voting instead of binary decisions, we recognize that in the current market downturn the DAO needs to be focused on work that is more closely aligned with [our purpose and essential intents](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/update-gitcoindaos-adopted-purpose-and-essential-intents/10984).

* Passport Identity Staking: We‚Äôve kicked off a new initiative to aid our Sybil Resistance efforts by allowing users to stake on identity. We‚Äôve completed initial inception and discovery work. Now, we‚Äôre moving quickly toward building a prototype with Scaffold-Eth.

* Operations: We‚Äôre gearing up for Season 15 by clarifying timelines, preparing for budget season, and working on drafting our OKRs. On the compensation side, we paid out all active contributors and are writing a standard compensation policy.

* [Emu](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/emudoteth/summary) writes [Moonshot Accountabilities; a contributor joint](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/moonshot-accountabilities-a-contributor-joint/11126) outlining the level of accountability for core, trusted, and citizen contributors. Core contributors ‚Äúproactively participate in the strategic planning of the workstream, while also driving the execution of work towards our initiatives.‚Äù Trusted contributors are considered for initiative teams but are not continuously staffed, and allowed great flexibility. Citizen contributors are the most common, sometimes staffed, and are invited to participate in context calls.

### üíô [Fraud Detection & Defense](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Fraud-Detection-Defense-2bde13c0b8e74fda81435d94e49e2703)

* [The FDD Review](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-the-fdd-review/11095) is a new communication series calling for honest critics to inform the community about what goes on inside FDD and provide feedback. This initiative comes ‚Äúafter a difficult restructuring and realignment sparked by the Season 14 Budget Request process, we learned that our communication was subpar.‚Äù
  * [Joseph Cook](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/j-cook) authors the first post in this series: [Rethinking FDD](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/rethinking-fdd-defending-against-fraud-optimizing-capital-allocation/11090) in which he makes the point that ‚ÄúFDD should stop asking ‚ÄúHow do we stop fraud‚Äù? and start asking ‚ÄúHow can we optimally allocate capital‚Äù?‚Äù One solution is measuring how well capital is allocated by surveying the community on what they‚Äôre interested in seeing funded and comparing it with the actual outcome.

### üé® [Merch, Memes & Marketing](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Merch-Memes-and-Marketing-60cc693f0fe14be1879a05587922c8a3)

* This week, we conducted [our retrospective](https://www.loom.com/share/b316addd618945a68eac7a8008a98a67) on Grants Round 14 and identified a need to create a content marketing strategy, start grants round marketing earlier, and tighten our partnership with the PGF workstream.

* We‚Äôre continuing the migration of our email and website to Hubspot and are excited about the new features this will unlock!

* [CoachJonathan](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/coachjonathan/summary) shared our methods and early results from [Experiments in Governance at MMM](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/experiments-in-governance-at-mmm/11113). In order to improve the clarity and process of our decision-making, we have implemented a three-phase system for proposals to become governance.
  * Phase 1: Proposals are conceived on discord or google docs.
  * Phase 2: Proposals go on [Murmur](https://help.murmur.com/en/articles/6106689-what-is-the-murmur-method) where we ask questions and decide if it should pass.
  * Phase 3: If a proposal passes on Murmur, it is codified in our [knowledgebase](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Memes-Merch-Marketing-60cc693f0fe14be1879a05587922c8a3).

### ‚òÄÔ∏è [DAO Operations](https://gitcoin.notion.site/DAO-Ops-84f425e281ae49579a2b4acf0bad5dd5)

* [CSDO:](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWEiZu1Jqkqn-axtQdtrNLg) At this week‚Äôs meeting, we discussed our preparation for Season 15 including [timeline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pdsLTBvXzEoMybLunlVF1K7HSVeGage5aoCwbBMuTc4/edit) and [proposal process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z8F0QGFSdVYgDMowdcsU0KA9Un7WdVwHugK9_0bfYT0/edit#heading=h.ci1jryji3nsw). The CSDO will discuss budget drafts internally over the next two weeks with drafts going on the forum by July 25th for comments. Season 15 will kick off August 1st and budgets should be proposed on snapshot by August 15th. Then, funds should be in workstreams multisigs by August 29th.

### üõ† [Grants 2.0](https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/Grants-2-0-f2860138cbb24505b5cb2d8576119a78)

* Grants Hub: We are finishing up the last pieces on our path to production: implementing [pinata.cloud](https://www.pinata.cloud/) as a storage solution, and auditing our smart contracts. We‚Äôve also conducted two user research sessions to identify what works and what doesn‚Äôt work for our users. Lastly, our latest [demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zHAJmvongcNhbnJkUQnnHhnLF9WcZyNx/view?usp=sharing) shows off the user flow for reviewing and creating new projects!

* Round Manager: We‚Äôre focusing on ensuring our product creates a publicly available record of all grant programs and rounds. In order to do that, we‚Äôre utilizing an [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) pinning service and storing a link to our pinned files in our smart contracts. Additionally, we‚Äôve [made our smart contracts upgradeable](https://share.vidyard.com/watch/ien577vt1W9bSnwdfbcH34?) to ensure we don‚Äôt lose any links. Lastly, we have created [high-fidelity designs](https://www.loom.com/share/c74272ba79c84229be2ee3dd06923ddf) for our MVP and are aiming for an August 1st launch date!

## üìÖ [Upcoming community events](https://www.addevent.com/calendar/pz351122)

* Drop in on our weekly [DAO Vibes](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/eventedit/copy/NWo3ODBxdmpmOHJ1ZGZqYnRxa3I2ZzhwdGhfMjAyMjA3MTNUMTYwMDAwWiBjX3R0NGczOGE2NnVtam1lcTE1NGFnY3AyZDRzQGc) on Wednesdays at 4:00 PM UTC on [Discord](http://gitcoin.co/discord)! We have been seeing great attendance and engagement and we would love for you to join us.

<p>Governance Operations Scaling: We‚Äôve made the difficult decision to put this initiative on pause. Although we still see value in building a tool that enables fluid, granular, and informed voting instead of binary decisions, we recognize that in the current market downturn the DAO needs to be focused on work that is more closely aligned with <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/update-gitcoindaos-adopted-purpose-and-essential-intents/10984">our purpose and essential intents</a>.</p>

<p>Passport Identity Staking: We‚Äôve kicked off a new initiative to aid our Sybil Resistance efforts by allowing users to stake on identity. We‚Äôve completed initial inception and discovery work. Now, we‚Äôre moving quickly toward building a prototype with Scaffold-Eth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operations: We‚Äôre gearing up for Season 15 by clarifying timelines, preparing for budget season, and working on drafting our OKRs. On the compensation side, we paid out all active contributors and are writing a standard compensation policy.</p>
