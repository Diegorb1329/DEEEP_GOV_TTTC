### üî• Hot Topics:

* Get ready for Grants Round 14 with this [thread](https://twitter.com/gitcoin/status/1532141317429440514):
‚Äú‚õ±Ô∏è We're kicking off #ReFiSummer with over $3M in matching funds including $1M in the main round... AND over $2M across a record-breaking 13 ecosystem rounds & 3 cause rounds‚Äù

* [Nate](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/nategosselin/summary) shares details about the hard work of [Prepping cGrants for its Final Voyage](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/prepping-cgrants-for-its-final-voyage/10777). The team has optimized the most popular checkout experience in terms of chain, wallet, and token options ‚Äúto handle the largest potential swath of traffic during a grants round.‚Äù New features include support for Coinbase Wallet and short URLs for each round within GR14. A number of fixes have also been applied to our search, ops workflow, and site copywriting. These updates will allow the team to focus on building the next version of the platform: [Grants 2.0](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-2-0/9981).

* [Disruption Joe](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/disruptionjoe/summary) presents [a model for Gitcoin sustainability](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-model-for-gitcoin-sustainability/10757) which takes a long-term view on Gitcoin as a solution to a resource-allocation problem. Joe believes GitcoinDAO can achieve sustainability through essential intents which focus on clearly and measurably launching a successful Grants 2.0 protocol and increasing the value of governance.
‚ÄúGTCs sole utility should be investing in workstreams, structured and unstructured, via Gitcoin governance. ‚Äú In order to do this, ‚ÄúGitcoin should use quadratic weighted staking to reward people for governance participation‚Äù and let staked GTC ‚Äúbe used to participate in the governance of the components of the Grants 2.0 protocol.‚Äù

* In [Roadmap to GTC Utility](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/roadmap-to-gtc-utility/10546/10), [Nate](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/nategosselin/summary) informs us that members of the DAO met to ‚Äúbrainstorm ways to increase the utility of GTC.‚Äù The reasons to do this include ‚Äúproviding legitimacy /longevity /viability for the DAO.‚Äù The team explored ideas such as staking GTC in Gitcoin Passport, a [Grants curation game](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KKd0BhgchnY5zYcubggagD8940pSTFicRBnDyCLC7b4/edit#heading=h.1al5rzyhmirq), a [Tokemak reactor](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-securing-a-gtc-token-reactor/9976), [mutual grants](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/constructing-a-mutual-grants-committee/10347), and liquidity pooling. The team will stand up a committee to keep working on this and present options to the CSDO.

* [Puncar](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/puncar-dev/summary) shares details about [the new structure of Gitcoin's forum and how to use it](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/what-is-the-new-structure-of-gitcoin-forum-and-how-to-use-it/10750). The forum now has new categories and includes tags which ‚Äú are used to inform the right people that they should read and/or comment on some new post.‚Äù You can now for example tag a post with ‚Äòstewards‚Äô to make sure your target audience can find it.

* [Bob](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/bobjiang/summary) walks us through [how to ask a question on Gitcoin](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-to-ask-a-question-on-gitcoin/10766). He suggests doing your own research before asking by using the MEE6 discord bot for FAQ, checking the [support knowledge base](https://support.gitcoin.co/), searching the Discord and [Google.](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=how+to+google) If you can‚Äôt find the answer, then seek support in the [Gitcoin Discord](http://discord.gg/gitcoin) server.

* In a [thread](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1532151196021968896) about how and why growing, idealistic movements increasingly conflict with one another, [Vitalik](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin) says one thing we can do about this ‚Äúis to focus more on the newer and smaller sub-movements, that are more opinionated about their values. The "regen finance" movement in ethereum (big credit to[ @gitcoin](https://twitter.com/gitcoin), [@proofofhumanity](https://twitter.com/proofofhumanity) and now [@optimismPBC](https://twitter.com/optimismPBC), arguably [@MolochDAO](https://twitter.com/MolochDAO) too) is one great example.‚Äù

* You do not want to miss [the latest episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNYeVT94dUk) of the [Green Pill podcast](http://availableon.com/greenpill)! In this episode, [Kevin Owocki](https://twitter.com/owocki) brings on Gitcoin‚Äôs [Leon Erichsen](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/leone/summary) to guest host a discussion with [Glen Weyl](https://twitter.com/glenweyl?s=20&t=nm_VaaD6VY0ll8OPdc2REQ) and [Puja Ohlaver](https://twitter.com/pujaohlhaver?s=20&t=nm_VaaD6VY0ll8OPdc2REQ). They discuss the ideas in the [DeSoc Paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763) authored by Puja, Glen, and [Vitalik](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin) which Leon contributed to.
