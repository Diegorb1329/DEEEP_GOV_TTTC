Badge guideline dilemma
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/badge-guideline-dilemma/16466
    I might have overlooked few posts, if I had, Please ignore my ignorance. However, I got quite anxious with the badge options, and its activity criterion. I searched for it, and didn't find any helpful guide about it. So, later on I searched on Badge by badge criteria. Like I searched on 'New user tuotrial', and I found only one post related to it - https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/about-the-news-and-community-category/34/4?u=gulliverz
Its posted quite a long time before by @bsam748 , I also didn't find any fruitful reply belonging to it :upside_down_face:
Please, requesting Gitcoin OGs like @owocki to create a blogpost or medium guide about it, and also post about it :slightly_smiling_face:

            <p>My apologies for failing to describe my query. However, if I complete tutorial with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/discobot">@discobot</a> , will it earn me the Certified badge. That‚Äôs what I understood from ur reply.</p>

Thanks a lot. So, I would suggest rather than the tag - Complete New user tutorial, start tutorial with discobot would be more appropriate.</p>

            <p>I‚Äôm not sure exactly what information you are looking for, but maybe some of this will help.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/badges" class="inline-onebox">Gitcoin Governance</a><br>
This page lists all the badges, and shows which you have.  You can click each one for more info.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Understanding Discourse Trust Levels</a><br>
Here is an article that explains the requirements to gain more access in the forums.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also send a message to <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/discobot">@discobot</a> with either ‚Äústart tutorial‚Äù or ‚Äústart advanced tutorial‚Äù and it will take you through a basic overview of how to use some different features here.  Each of those will give you a badge on completion, and now I realize that‚Äôs probably what you are looking for since you asked about the ‚Äúnew user tutorial‚Äù, which is how the badge describes it.</p>
<p>That was actually a little hard for me to find.  I had to search off site and look at other forums who use the same system.  I‚Äômlad the info can be useful to someone else as well.  <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
