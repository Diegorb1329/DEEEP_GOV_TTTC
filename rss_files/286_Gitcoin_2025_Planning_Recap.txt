            <p>thanks for your time and thoughts <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/thedevanshmehta">@thedevanshmehta</a> ! Glad to hear your bullishness.</p>
<p>I think we‚Äôre still figuring out the right positioning vis a vis Allo and Grant Labs. I do think you‚Äôre right that Allo is much more frontier-focused and Grants Labs is focused on enterprise clients.</p>
<p>Based on our experiences over the last year and the testing we‚Äôve done in rolling out pricing, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a ton of room to grow our take rate. For some programs we charge up to 10%, but this is often the total amount that grants programs budget for operational costs.</p>
<p>I definitely agree with Juan Benet that we need to figure out sustainable ways of funding new mechanisms! Allo Labs is focused on bringing down the cost to get these launched.</p>

            <p>Just finished going through all the slides, very exhaustive for what has happened in 2024 and whats coming ahead!</p>
<p>I‚Äôm especially bullish on the demarcation between grant and allo labs, which respectively focus on enterprise sales &amp; rapid $30k pilot sprints of new mechanisms.</p>
<p>On the recent green pill podcast vitalik mentioned we have room for around 3-5 more mechanisms to fund  ethereum public goods (the others being QF, Protocol Guild &amp; RetroPGF, each vulnerable to influencer games, closing off to newcomers &amp; currying favor with badgeholders).</p>
<p>Would it be right to think of Allo as a cost center that is on the forefront discovering the new mechanisms waiting to be built, while labs is a revenue center that is getting business from enterprise clients?</p>
<p>I also appreciated the statistic that 6.5% overhead on grants worked on was earned by labs. Do you think this is a healthy amount or something that can be increased without turning away clients? In the greenpill podcast with juan benet i remember him mentioning that overhead for new mechanisms can go as high as 40%, while we need to do an overall better job of supporting mechanism designers not just the mechanisms</p>

            <p>Thanks for your thoughts <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/tomislavmamic">@tomislavmamic</a> . Answers below!</p>
<p>1- Gitcoin will be continuing to pursue large EVM-based grant programs at L2s/protocols this year and focusing on deploying grants to drive ecosystem growth</p>
<p>2- Agreed. There is a ton of overhead in managing grant programs and not a lot of specialized tools to help grants managers. Our focus will be on driving time savings with these tools, like Checker.</p>
<p>3- We believe that grants are best deployed using the right tools for the job vs a one-size-fits all approach. Over the last two years, we‚Äôve seen a rise in retrofunding, futarchy, and now deepfunding, in addition to direct grants and QF. While we won‚Äôt focus on building every mechanism out there, we believe that we need to build the ones that will be most popular and effective for our customers.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the update! It‚Äôs always good sign to see such a strong focus on both the customers and the product. Really appreciate the effort being put in.</p>
<p>I do have a question and a couple of thoughts to share:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Which market segments and pressing problems will Gitcoin be addressing this year?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I might have missed it if it was shared earlier, but I don‚Äôt recall seeing anything recent on this. It would be great to understand the priorities and areas of focus.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>While exploring AI and innovation is exciting, I feel that opportunity for thought leadership alone shouldn‚Äôt be the main driver for venturing into such areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>About the multi-mechanism future:</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Could you share a bit more about the reasoning behind this direction? Have you identified any specific use cases or market needs where combining mechanisms unlocks significant value? At first glance, the idea is exciting, but without clear customer segments or validated use cases, there‚Äôs a risk of investing resources into something that may not align with real-world needs. On the flip side, there‚Äôs also the potential to miss out on opportunities in this space.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing more thoughts on this! Thanks again for the hard work and transparency in keeping us all in the loop. <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/raised_hands.png?v=12" title=":raised_hands:" class="emoji" alt=":raised_hands:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
