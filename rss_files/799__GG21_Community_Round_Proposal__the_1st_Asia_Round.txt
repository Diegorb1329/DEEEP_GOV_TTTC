### Alignment with Gitcoin’s [Mission1](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/update-gitcoins-adopted-mission-and-vision-statements/15039) and [Essential Intents](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/update-gitcoin-s-ratified-essential-intents-2023-2024-and-a-recap-of-our-successes/16818)

Asia, with its 4.6 billion people and over 2,300 languages, is an essential region for the mass adoption of Web3 public goods.The GG21 Asia Round is an exciting initiative of two leading communities in Asia - designed to unlock the potential of talented Asian innovators, builders, and projects by providing them with essential funding and resources. 

We will:

1. Accept project applications in native languages in addition to English, minimizing inequality due to language proficiency.
2. Invite leaders from local communities and media partners as advisors to provide local insights, promote the Asia Round, and enhance the diversity and quality of project applications. 

Additionally, our funding focus will lean towards developer communities, policy advocacy, funding mechanisms and tools & anti-censorship. We believe this embodies Gitcoin's mission to "create technologies and opportunities that enable communities to build, fund, and protect what matters." Asia's vast community and user base will also best ensure Gitcoin's intents of network effect, community-first approach, and financial longevity.

### Anticipated Size of the Matching Pool: 

- The matching pool is anticipated to be 25k-50k USD. GCC is confirmed to provide 25k.  We would love to match it with another 25k USD from the GG21 matching fund.
- Funding address:  eth:0x060114DD2D88b02Fe5Bb11A57B531e67DAE0cF54; oeth:0x37b8E2747D5E8BE8dD35DE8A942d2c97eBb49D28

### Advisors for This Round: 

Bob Jiang, GITCOIN China founder, co-organize Ethereum Sydney, [twitter](https://x.com/bobjiang123)
Vienna Looi, ETH KL, Cryptobuddhistecon, [twitter](https://twitter.com/viennazero)

GCC itself has a standing voting committee, composed of experienced professionals in the industry. The list of committee members can be found at [here](https://www.gccofficial.org/contribution.html)

We will also invite the leaders of our partnering communities and media this round. Our partners include, but are not limited to, EthPadThai, Code for Japan, da0, Eth Vietnam, Eth63, APAC DAO, Eth KL, wublockchain, DeSci Asia, LXDAO, Uncommons, PlanckerDAO, 4seas, etc.

### Funding Mechanism:

We are using the combination model of QF + signal booster. 

**QF:** Overall, we use Gitcoin's quadratic funding mechanism. Team members will screen projects that meet the eligibility criteria, and then the matching amount for each project will be calculated based on the donations received by that project. However, the maximum matching amount for any single project should not exceed 10% of the total matching pool.

**Signal booster:**  Inspired by the Gitcoin Citizen Round and in order to better combat Sybil attacks and introducing expert opinions, we will allocate $5000 from the matching pool and form a group of 10 people selected from our advisors, sponsors, community partners, and the GCC Standing Voting Committee. Each member will be given $500 to distribute to the Asia round projects and share their allocation strategies publicly. This design, combined with community donations, will determine the final amount of funds each Asia round project will receive from the matching pool based on QF mechanism.

### Community Size and Engagement:

- In this round - we are capturing the network of two major communities 1) GCC and 2) Pagoda.

- GCC is short for global Chinese community of Universal Digital Commons.  We have a core community of over 2,000 people distributed across X, Telegram, and WeChat. Additionally, we have partnerships with 15+ Chinese-speaking communities and media outlets, reaching an audience of 10k+ people. In the past 4 community rounds that we initiated, **we mobilized a total of around 8k individual donors, raising over $58k from them.** This is a testament to our impact. This time, by collaborating with community partners across Asia, we aim to expand the influence by 3 to 5 times.

![截屏2024-07-13 11.30.19|444x500](upload://4noTGiYRI5O3I0BP4boQ7uEoIgi.jpeg)

- Pagoda is the Asia Ethereum network with 60 registered members from **14 different Asia countries**, including Korea, Japan, Mongolia, China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the Phillipines, Indonesia, Combodia, Myanmar, India and Vietnam. We have a reach of **30,000+** community members/builders from **20+** Ethereum/Public Goods focused communities. 

### Type of Projects to Fund:

We aim to fund projects that in the following catogories: 

1. **Asian Dev Communities:** Projects that aim to build and support local Ethereum dev communities across Asia.
2. **Policy Advocacy:** projects that help improve the policy environment for crypto startups across Asia.
3. **Public goods funding protocols and tools:** Initiatives that explore innovative and credible-neutral funding protocols and tools for public goods and the builders in the region.
4. **Privacy and Anti-censorship:** Projects focused on enhancing privacy and combating censorship within the Asian Ethereum ecosystem.

### Estimated Number of Eligible Grantees:

- We expected ～50 eligible grantees from 10+ Asian countries.

### Impact Assessment Plan: 

For the community round itself, the core data we focus on are:

* Number of donors
* Funds raised
* Number of projects applied, countries/languages of origin
* Views and interactions of core tweets

For the selected projects, we will measure their subsequent impact through the following methods:

* Growth in members of the project's official social media and community
* If the project's main market includes the countries where our partner communities/media come from, they will help provide community reviews
* If the project has applications launched in app markets, we will monitor their download numbers, etc.
* Frequency and content of updates in the project's GitHub repository

### Additional Considerations:

Exceptional projects, in addition to applying for this Asia round, can also apply directly to GCC for larger grants (up to $50,000) after the community round. This requires submitting a more detailed financial plan, milestones and roadmap, technical solution, etc.

### Potential Conflicts of Interest:

As Pagoda is a network of Ethereum/public goods Asia builders around Asia, we do have some of our team members that will potentially participate to receive a grant through this round. Potential projects include:

- Vivian Chen: Zulandia Taiwan
- Vienna Looi: Eth KL

<p>Asia, with its 4.6 billion people and over 2,300 languages, is an essential region for the mass adoption of Web3 public goods.The GG21 Asia Round is an exciting initiative of two leading communities in Asia - designed to unlock the potential of talented Asian innovators, builders, and projects by providing them with essential funding and resources.</p>
<p>We will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accept project applications in native languages in addition to English, minimizing inequality due to language proficiency.</li>
<li>Invite leaders from local communities and media partners as advisors to provide local insights, promote the Asia Round, and enhance the diversity and quality of project applications.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, our funding focus will lean towards developer communities, policy advocacy, funding mechanisms and tools &amp; anti-censorship. We believe this embodies Gitcoin’s mission to “create technologies and opportunities that enable communities to build, fund, and protect what matters.” Asia’s vast community and user base will also best ensure Gitcoin’s intents of network effect, community-first approach, and financial longevity.</p>
<h3><a name="anticipated-size-of-the-matching-pool-7" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#anticipated-size-of-the-matching-pool-7"></a>Anticipated Size of the Matching Pool:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The matching pool is anticipated to be 25k-50k USD. GCC is confirmed to provide 25k.  We would love to match it with another 25k USD from the GG21 matching fund.</li>
<li>Funding address:  eth:0x060114DD2D88b02Fe5Bb11A57B531e67DAE0cF54; oeth:0x37b8E2747D5E8BE8dD35DE8A942d2c97eBb49D28</li>

<p>GCC itself has a standing voting committee, composed of experienced professionals in the industry. The list of committee members can be found at <a href="https://www.gccofficial.org/contribution.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a></p>
<p>We will also invite the leaders of our partnering communities and media this round. Our partners include, but are not limited to, EthPadThai, Code for Japan, da0, Eth Vietnam, Eth63, APAC DAO, Eth KL, wublockchain, DeSci Asia, LXDAO, Uncommons, PlanckerDAO, 4seas, etc.</p>
<h3><a name="funding-mechanism-9" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#funding-mechanism-9"></a>Funding Mechanism:</h3>
<p>We are using the combination model of QF + signal booster.</p>
<p><strong>QF:</strong> Overall, we use Gitcoin’s quadratic funding mechanism. Team members will screen projects that meet the eligibility criteria, and then the matching amount for each project will be calculated based on the donations received by that project. However, the maximum matching amount for any single project should not exceed 10% of the total matching pool.</p>
<p><strong>Signal booster:</strong>  Inspired by the Gitcoin Citizen Round and in order to better combat Sybil attacks and introducing expert opinions, we will allocate $5000 from the matching pool and form a group of 10 people selected from our advisors, sponsors, community partners, and the GCC Standing Voting Committee. Each member will be given $500 to distribute to the Asia round projects and share their allocation strategies publicly. This design, combined with community donations, will determine the final amount of funds each Asia round project will receive from the matching pool based on QF mechanism.</p>
<h3><a name="community-size-and-engagement-10" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#community-size-and-engagement-10"></a>Community Size and Engagement:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this round - we are capturing the network of two major communities 1) GCC and 2) Pagoda.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GCC is short for global Chinese community of Universal Digital Commons.  We have a core community of over 2,000 people distributed across X, Telegram, and WeChat. Additionally, we have partnerships with 15+ Chinese-speaking communities and media outlets, reaching an audience of 10k+ people. In the past 4 community rounds that we initiated, <strong>we mobilized a total of around 8k individual donors, raising over $58k from them.</strong> This is a testament to our impact. This time, by collaborating with community partners across Asia, we aim to expand the influence by 3 to 5 times.</p>
