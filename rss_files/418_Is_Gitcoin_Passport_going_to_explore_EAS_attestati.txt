    Hey everyone!

Currently, Gitcoin Passport is offering attestations (stamps and scores) in Optimism with a 21.5% of share in EAS attestations.

You can check it here => https://dune.com/ivanmolto/gitcoin-passport-eas-optimism


On the other hand, EAS in Optimism is +50 times greater than in Arbitrum with Devfolio having a 62.1% of share in attestations there.

As this dashboard displays  =>  https://dune.com/ivanmolto/eas-arbitrum

My question is all attestations by Gitcoin Passport will be locked to Optimism or is there an intent to explore Arbitrum in the future? Thank you
