[PROPOSAL]: Updating Community Multisig Signers on gitcoin.eth
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-updating-community-multisig-signers-on-gitcoin-eth/19337
    ### TL;DR:

* Remove current community multisig signers from the gitcoin.eth multisig.
* Add two new community members as multisig signers.
* Align with Gitcoin's commitment to decentralization and community stewardship.

### Context & Rationale:

The Gitcoin Grants program has consistently emphasized the importance of decentralizing fund management to empower community members. One core mechanism that supports this decentralization is the governance over the matching pool funds held within the gitcoin.eth multisig.

Currently, itâ€™s procedure to include two community members as signers on this multisig, chosen by Gitcoin to act as trusted community stewards for the matching pool funds. However, to maintain transparency, and ensure broad representation, we regularly rotate the signers and bring in new community representatives.

### Proposal:

We propose to:

1. Remove the current community multisig signers from gitcoin.eth to ensure the periodic rotation of responsibilities and avoid any accumulation of influence by a single group over time.

Annika Lewis

2. Appoint two new community members as multisig signers, selected based on their active involvement in the Gitcoin community and commitment to stewarding public goods.

The new signers are both active longtime members within the Gitcoin community and have served on the GG Community Council since April 2024. They will be empowered to manage the multisig, alongside the existing Gitcoin contributorsâ€™ signers, in a way that ensures the security and appropriate allocation of the matching pool funds.

### Conclusion:

Rotating the gitcoin.eth multisig signers is a critical step in ensuring the ongoing decentralization and transparency of Gitcoinâ€™s matching pool fund management. By refreshing the signer pool with new community representatives, we reaffirm our commitment to putting the community at the center of decision-making processes.

### Vote

I would like to have us vote to remove and add the above mentioned community members as multisig signers.
1. Remove two existing community members as multisig signers, and add two new community members as signers.
2. Do not remove two existing community members and no not add two new community members as signers.
3. Abstain.
