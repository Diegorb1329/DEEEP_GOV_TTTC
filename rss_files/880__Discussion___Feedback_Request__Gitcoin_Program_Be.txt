https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-feedback-request-gitcoin-program-beta-round-eligibility/13306
    **Introduction**

The Gitcoin Program Beta Round is the second set of Gitcoin Program QF rounds that will run on the new decentralized [Grants Stack](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-gitcoin-grants-stack-allo-protocol-product-overviews-part-1-of-2/12664). The planned dates for this round are **April 25th to May 9th** and there will be **5 Core Rounds** each with a distinct matching pool: 

* **Climate Solutions**
* **Ethereum Infrastructure**
* **Web3 Community & Education**
* **Web3 Open Source Software**
* **ZK Tech**

As we continue our efforts to [decentralize](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/decentralizing-the-gitcoin-grants-program/12669) and [shape the new Gitcoin Grants Program](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/shaping-the-new-gitcoin-grants-program-with-community-engagement/12811), these rounds were chosen from a larger pool by the community through a [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoingov.eth/proposal/0x3bebac743d1da8e72618dceb2c108d3cd71dddb10b8008456abcc87c2ca40992).
![|221x419](upload://b4HguizhqcB3bykd9PwHRUc44a9.png)
*Note: There will also be a number of externally operated Featured Rounds that run in this same 2-week window; the details of which are still being determined.*

The purpose of this post is to outline the general eligibility policy that **ALL grants** must meet in order to qualify for acceptance into any of the 5 core rounds. In addition to the general eligibility, grants must meet the extra criteria for the round they are applying for. The description of each specific round’s eligibility criteria is listed after the general eligibility policy. 

**The PGF team is asking DAO contributors, stewards, and community members to carefully read these eligibility requirements and provide feedback or engage in an open discussion where needed**. The requirements are subject to change but will be locked in before the application window opens.

---------------------------------------------------------
**Gitcoin Program General Eligibility Policy**

This policy is set and enforced by the FDD & PGF workstreams of the GitcoinDAO and is ratified by the GitcoinDAO stewards. The following are **not permitted** in Gitcoin-operated rounds:

* **Hateful Content** - No racist, sexist, or otherwise hateful speech, no discrimination
* **Deceiving Users** - Malicious content that could cause harm or unintended consequences to users
* **Falsification** - Any type of hacking to falsify a contribution is prohibited. No encouraging or enabling Sybil attacks or other forms of malicious manipulation of the grants platform or the Gitcoin community
* **Fraud & Impersonation** - Claiming to be a brand or person you are not. The Grant owner must be directly affiliated with the project, the funds must go to the project, and be used for the purposes stated in the Grant’s details
* **Quid Pro Quo & Bribery** - The Grant may not have any form of quid pro quo that has financial value (a scenario in which a user gets some additional unique benefit/award in return for their donation)
* **Advertising** - Using grants to showcase something you are selling like a token sale or NFT drop
* **Well-capitalized projects** - Not have prior external funding of over $500k USD via venture capital, token launches, or NFT sales
* **Grantees cannot be subject to sanctions**, and funding cannot be used in violation of any applicable law, rules, or regulations (for example those addressing sanctions, financing of terrorism, and anti-money-laundering)
* Grantees can be eliminated from consideration in the round if they are found to be **encouraging or enabling Sybil attacks** or other forms of malicious manipulation of the grants platform or the Gitcoin community.

Additional criteria that projects must meet:

* **Project Update** - If you are a returning grantee, you must provide an update on what work has been accomplished since the last grant round your project received funding from
* **Verified Github (if applicable) and/or Twitter account**


---------------------------------------------------------
**Web3 OSS Round Eligibility**

To qualify for the Web3 OSS round, in addition to meeting the criteria outlined in the program policy above, grants must:

* Be an open-source project with meaningful Github activity in the prior 3 months that has demonstrated work completed towards the project’s mission
* Primarily focused on developing on top of or advancing the broader Ethereum and/or Web3 industry

---------------------------------------------------------
**Ethereum Infrastructure Eligibility**

* The Grant must be in **support of, or directly advancing the Ethereum ecosystem**. This includes areas like:
  * Core client devs (e.g., geth / nethermind; prysm / lighthouse)
  * Tooling providers (e.g., hardhat / ethers.js)
  * Those showcasing the power of critical ecosystem ideas (e.g., dark forest with zero-knowledge proofs)
  * Those doing the hard work of educating developers (e.g., Austin (Gitcoin) / Nader (DeveloperDAO))
* The Grant must be open source (if software-related)

---------------------------------------------------------
**Climate Solutions Round Eligibility**

* Projects must be at least 3 months old. Newer projects should establish themselves and submit to the next round.

* The Grant must be **primarily focused on climate solutions** (the group may do other work but the grant proposal should be directly related to climate solutions). The proposal should explicitly outline how this project will help reduce GHGs or is an important core infrastructure for web3 climate solutions.

* Grantees who received funding in previous rounds **should report on project progress since GR15 or the Alpha round**. We understand that some projects may have less progress given the timing of Alpha round disbursements. This will ensure accountability to supporters and also help encourage contributors by showing what you’ve been accomplishing.

* **All returning grantees are expected to update their proposal**, in addition to project updates the proposal should include lessons learned from previous work and how they will use the additional funding from the upcoming round. The updated proposal should indicate how additional funding will help the project meet its goals, and include a rough timeline for the project overall.

* There is a general expectation that projects are within the “**realm of viability**”.
  * Even if a project may be at a very early stage, it still must seem credible to the average person with an understanding of web3 technology and climate solutions.
  * Grantee founders must genuinely intend to build the project, and the project must not broadly be considered an impossibility.

---------------------------------------------------------
**Web3 Community & Education Round Eligibility**

The Web3 Community & Education Round is a new category that has not been a Gitcoin Program round in the past; however there have been similar ecosystem rounds called ‘Media’ and ‘Community’.

Reflecting on the Alpha Rounds and all the legacy “Main Round” grants, there were many great projects that couldn’t join OSS due to specific “active OSS repo” requirements. In GR12 and before we had mutually exclusive categories like "infrastructure" "dapps" and "community" - and this would be like the old community category, which included podcasts, newsletters, educational projects, journalists, and more.

As we’ve now split open-source software into its own round, we will run this Web3 Community & Education Round to focus on non-software related projects that are helping to push the Web3 space forward.

The requirements to be accepted in this round are outlined below*:

* **The project must be focused on improving the Web3 ecosystem**.
* Examples of projects which may fit are those that are:
  * Growing new communities
  * Providing educational resources
  * Creating content (youtube tutorials, newsletters, blog posts, podcasts, etc)
  * Protecting users by investigating bad actors
  * DAOs focused on socialization
  * Onboarding new users
  * Working on inclusion/diversity/advocacy

**Note: As this is a new Core Round category, we’d love to have the community weigh in and narrow the scope or suggest more objective criteria.*

---------------------------------------------------------
**ZK Tech Round Eligibility**

* The Grant must be in support of, or directly **advancing the ZK tools, libraries, community, or protocols**.
* The Grant may not have any form of quid pro quo that has financial value (a scenario in which a user gets some additional unique benefit/award in return for their donation)
* The Grant owner must be directly affiliated with the project and the funds must go to the project.
* The Grant should be focused on accomplishing the following for ZK:
  * **Usability** - improving the user experience of zero-knowledge tools/libraries, not zero-knowledge rollups. This could also be technical education and documentation.
  *  **Tooling** - improving the developer experience or making it easier to develop applications utilizing zero-knowledge proofs or technology.
  *  **Applications** - technical implementations of zero-knowledge proofs and circuits, not simply applications built on top of zero-knowledge roll-ups.

* The project should not have its own token or have raised VC funding (let’s keep the funds for the aspiring projects!)
* The project must have been active in the last 3 months - social media and GitHub.
* The project should have demonstrated either concrete progress, or evidence of a substantive technical roadmap that clarifies how ZK technology will be used and advanced.
* The Grant deliverables should be open source.

---------------------------------------------------------
**Conclusion**

These eligibility requirements are designed to ensure we capture and provide funding to the highest quality projects in each category. As a reminder, the requirements are not yet set in stone and we are **highly encouraging the community to discuss what makes sense and what could be changed**. Thanks for reading this far and stay tuned for more updates!

            <p>I wanna leave some feedback here for the DEI round selection process.</p>
<p>I understand that this is the first time such a round is being organised and there can be nuances in selecting the right projects. The problem specially arises with ‘1DAO/org=1 application’ policy, if a DAO has several projects listed under its application, and some of those projects clearly fit under the DEI category based on other similar projects which have been selected, but then the DAOs’ application in question does not get selected because the application does not specifically fit into the DEI round, then this causes friction between reviewers and policy making.</p>
<p>I’d also like to express my dissatisfaction at the inability of reviewers to correctly implement ‘1DAO/org=1 application’ rule. I personally do not agree with that rule, but if it is a rule then I’d expect it to be evenly applied across all orgs</p>

            <p>Ok so this was my first time applying for the beta round for one ! My project got rejected probably I wasn’t able to explain my idea properly but I would like to emphasise it would be great if some sort of feedback is provided at the time of rejection. We don’t know why the projected was rejected even before the round even after putting so much effort in to it</p>

<h3>Multiple projects per round</h3>
<p>By this we mean I guess, an org having multiple grants for multiple of their subprojects in as many different rounds as possile. This should not be allowed. The organization behind the grant should be identified and if the same, then disallowed to have multiple grants in different rounds to maximize return.</p>
<p>Otherwise we are all incentivized to split our grants into smaller subprojects. I for example could split a part of rotki that deals with infra of the ethereum network and put it in infra and the rest of the opensource app in opensource. And double dip.</p>
<p>Others can do the same. Then it becomes a mess.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Unfortunately, I would have to disagree with this statement.<br>
I definitely understand that it makes sense in the context of Rotki.<br>
However, personally, I collaborate loosely with multiple teams and on multiple projects. Its just so happens that its much easier to have one github org than multiple. Your proposal would take a lot more time on red-tapping and unnecessary line toeing. Honestly, sounds a bit self-righteous.</p>

            <p>In our case, directed.dev leads to a rabbit hole of information for the visitor who is interested (eg Public Notion page, then progress updates/newsletter, or whitepaper). There’s also plenty on our Twitter and, most importantly, the vlog series that I started to document the work behind the scenes, e.g. us trying the onboarding to crypto in our pilot school in Kenya. I can’t include links but if you search for “Launching a Web3 Charity <span class="hashtag">#10</span>, Kagumo High School!” then you’ll see</p>

            <p>This is a good opportunity for DEI projects and their communities to become more active in the forums. I don’t think it’s easy for most people who aren’t personally affected by DEI challenges to actively work to improve this situation. It’s also not easy feeling underrepresented and taking the initiative to be one of the first to advocate for yourself and your community. A good solution could be to encourage a few of the more vocal leaders nudging others to express their opinions/ concerns in between rounds, even starting now for the next round instead of waiting until it’s too late. I’ve been pushing the LatAm community to do this, but haven’t seen much participation so I have to push harder.</p>

            <p>There is a challenge around DEI here. It is caught in a scarcity trap. We don’t prioritise it and so we continue to miss the benefits of diversity in the ecosystem. How might we shift our values enough to recognize the opportunity cost we continue to incur in the absence of more diverse participation?</p>

            <p>I like the eligibility, just wondering how it may apply to existing projects just now making their way to web3. As an example: As part of my “Impact Onboarding” strategies, I’m working to onboard NGOs that have a proven track record, so they can adopt the tech to gamify their efforts and report impact transparently. Does this mean they would have to be in web3 for 3 months or am I misunderstanding that?</p>
<p>We should try to make the reporting easy by offering a wireframe for this.  Something like “list 5 impactful projects you used funding for since the last round.”</p>

<p>I completely agree Shawn - as mentioned above I plan to make a revised gov post at the end of the week that highlights the changes made to this criteria. However, the way we choose what to change or add is unclear. I’d like to strike a balance between the two ends of the spectrum - i.e. one person making that decision and going to snapshot vote for every rule change. For this round I was thinking we could host a call with the PGF team and open it to all DAO core contributors, and do smaller-scale live voting on some of the proposed changes. I’m curious to hear what your thoughts are around this topic.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This makes sense to me. One thing I would add is that we should distinguish between which rules would apply to any round in the quarterly grants program including featured rounds and which would be specific to only some sub set of rounds. One of the great things about the program now being decentralized is we can have different criteria for different rounds. We for sure want to have some general rules that apply across the board in the program, for example rules around sybil or hate speech but some other rules may not make sense for every different round.</p>

<p>After reflecting on this, I actually do think a single grant should be able to qualify for multiple core rounds. With the current architecture the donations in each round would count separately for matching, and if they meet the eligibility criteria of more than one round I don’t see why they shouldn’t be able to pull funding from those sources. Otherwise, we are essentially asking them to conduct some game theory-esque analysis on which round is the most beneficial for them to join and that may never be a clear-cut answer.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree with the reasoning behind this but worry about the implementation during the Beta and what that experience will be like for donors and grantees. Really to me this makes the case for prioritizing jet fuel QF.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Probably best if grantees are only in one round for the Beta rounds just given it would be confusing for donors to see the same grant in different rounds and have to donate more than once if they want to support a project. Ideally in the not too distant future we implement “jet fuel QF” which enables people to donate to a project in more than one round at the same time. This would make it a better experience for grantees and donors in future rounds.</p>

<p>And on a similar wavelength - should a single person be allowed to have multiple different grants in the same round? Should they be allowed to have multiple different grants in different rounds? Is this really enforceable in an “anon-friendly” platform?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This question is a bit more complicated. Personally I think each project should stand on its own based on the eligibility criteria. We shouldn’t punish individuals for being part of more than one project nor should we create incentives for individuals to hide themselves from view if they are part of more than one project. And as you pointed out its hard to be clear about who is involved in a project in an anon space.</p>
<p>This also ties into the discussion of the same organization having more than one proposal for their different initiatives. To me this really comes down to if these individual initiatives are real and how the funds are actually allocated. We shouldn’t punish a DAO or other organizations or individuals for doing more than one thing. We also shouldn’t create incentives that force organizations to splinter or split up in order to qualify for funding. The missing piece here IMO is having improved reporting, updating and verification. I’m hopeful that a community of impact certificates and attestation providers will grow in the year ahead and this will dramatically increase transparency and accountability.</p>

<p>Quid Pro Quo - We’ve always had issues drawing the line here. Does a POAP count as QPQ? Does a Discord role count as QPQ? We’ve tried to draw the line at “monetary value”, but we’ve also seen things like POAPs act as incentives even without “value” - and of course, we get into potential airdrop speculation/farming territory.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>My two cents on this one is that we shouldn’t allow grantees to promise anything in return for donations in their proposal or elsewhere in their community outreach. This may get complicated as people provide retroactive air drops or other things to their community members but it would be best if these sort of thing was genuinely retroactive. Its great when Gitcoin is a community organizing tool and a way for grantees to find their community and continue to engage with them. The goal needs to be to ensure donations are not coming in to receive a reward and to protect the voting with your wallet component of QF, people shouldn’t be selling votes.</p>

<p>NFT “sales” or drops have also been a bit of a gray area - would love to hear what others think about this.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The key part of this question to me is the word sale. Gitcoin grants rounds shouldn’t be used to promote an NFT drop or some other form of a sale. That being said NFTs are a broad category of web3 tools used as impact certificates, attestations, carbon offset and renewable energy certificates etc. The distinction should be if the NFT is being used as a utility or as part of the community engagement strategy for a project with goals related to the round they are applying for vs if the NFT is the whole project in and of itself. A portion of funding from an NFT sale should not be considered as adequate to be seen as being tied to the the objectives of the round.</p>

<p>Matching caps - are they good? Should they be higher? Lower? Removed altogether?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Matching caps are critical to distribution of funds to a wider spectrum of grantees. Perhaps there should be some guidelines for matching caps based on the size of the round. A lower cap the larger the round. We have done this somewhat organically but it could be a bit more structured moving forward to provide some suggestions to round operators. I would also potentially support a maximum match for projects across the whole program quarterly for projects if a project is allowed to be in multiple rounds.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>should we aim to be more strict on approvals to better curate quality projects</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think the answer to this question very much depends on the goals of the individual round. In general I think we should be very careful about not allowing sybil attacks or scams into the rounds but the question of “quality” is pretty subjective and in a sense is why we are harnessing the “wisdom of the crowd”. What’s important is that the eligibility criteria is very clear and continues to be refined for each round as edge cases come forward. As a general rule I usually suggest to round operators that when considering a potential grantee we ask ourselves how we would feel if they raised the most money in the round. If that would seem problematic then it should tell us something about how to refine the eligibility criteria and why.</p>
<p>I would love to see more community members getting involved in the Grant Round Operators Guild (the GR OGs) and weighing in on the decisions for the rounds eligibility. Many of these decisions are hard to capture in broad strokes policies and requires talking about the specifics of a project in detail with a group. I believe that having a healthy community of grants round operators will be critical for the growth and impact of our grants programs as well as independent rounds run on the Grants Stack.</p>
<p>Love seeing this conversations happening in public with so much community input.</p>

            <p>I absolutely agree with all of this. Especially two things.</p>
<p><strong>Consistent wallet address</strong> (and if not that, then at least keep a history of the changes to a project’s wallet from inception). I think it’s important to one day be able to go back in time and figure out what’s been happening on chain. Forensic evidence as it were.</p>
<p><strong>One grant, one project, per team.</strong> This is equally important to me. If GitCoin doesn’t do this, then my only recourse is to make TrueBlocks ten projects which I don’t want to do.</p>

            <p>First off, I’m very excited about the Beta Round being just around the corner. Congrats!</p>
<p>I’d like to see eligibility criteria become more <strong>transparent and independently verifiable</strong>. Some of the things I would advocate for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A consistent wallet address for receiving donations</strong>. I’d like to see projects receive donations via a wallet (ideally multisig) that resolves to a project ENS and has name tags on Etherscan. Anyone can verify these things in one click – and get a good sense for how much money the project has flowing through it. I think <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x9531C059098e3d194fF87FebB587aB07B30B1306" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Rotki is exemplary</a> in this regard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Active OSS / Github repo</strong>. I’m glad that <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/koday">@koday</a> is proposing that Github activity continue to be a requirement for OSS projects. I’d like this criterion extended for any other projects that are building software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>One-click proof of work / impact</strong>. For education, community, media, climate-related public goods (ie, basically anything that isn’t OSS), I’d like there to be a “proof of work” that’s accessible in one click. Ideally, it’s dated and has some basic metric for reach / engagement. A newsletter, podcast feed, Discourse forum, project dashboard all serve this function. Make it easy to prove that you or your project is doing something that matters to people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Snapshot / voting history for DAOs</strong>.  If you’re a DAO, prove you have a community. Snapshot is one of several good tools for signaling you are more than one person and capable of managing a budget.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I’d like to move away from arbitrary requirements like “not have prior external funding of over $500k USD”. Per <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/tjayrush">@tjayrush</a>’s comment, there are incredible projects that have multiple people working full-time for multiple years on them. This criterion feels arbitrary, hard to enforce without insider info or “honor code”, and unfair to long-standing projects.</p>
<p>I’d like to see the projects <strong>within a round</strong> empowered and given tools to self-police against quid pro quos, advertising, Sybil attacks and other practices intended to manipulate the QF. I’m not sure how best to orchestrate this but want to see QF rounds among projects embody the <a href="https://canadianultimate.com/en_us/spirit-of-the-game" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Ultimate Frisbee style “spirit of the game”</a>. This is especially important given the <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s17-proposal-integrated-fdd-budget-request/12738">sunsetting of FDD</a>, the part of the DAO that was most vigilant in rooting out such behavior.</p>
<p>Regarding round dynamics, I also have the following thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rounds shouldn’t be <em>too big</em>.</strong> Generally, I’d like to see a ratio of at least $10K in matching funding per project within a round. So a matching pool of at least $200K for a round with 20 projects in it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>One project:round only</strong>. Projects (and teams) should not be able to participate in more than one round. The recommendation about having a consistent wallet address can mitigate this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Projects should be established.</strong> I agree with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/koday">@koday</a>’s proposal of at least a 3 month track record. I would extend that by giving the grants more of a retrospective bent: the descriptions should focus on what the projects have accomplished in the recent pass (eg, between grants rounds), not what they plan to do with more money. I don’t want grants to have prospective “deliverables” but I do want them to have proof of work/impact.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, it’s in bear market conditions like we face today that Gitcoin’s mission is most important. I’d like to see every marginal dollar go towards teams that are buidling through the bear – and setting clear, consistent eligibility requirements is one of the best ways we can do that!</p>

<p>We would like to give out as much money as possible to as many promising projects. To maximize the number of projects who receive funding, we put in a 5% matching cap on each round.</p>
<p>So we have Project <span class="hashtag-raw">#1</span> who participates in Round A. Meanwhile Project <span class="hashtag-raw">#2</span> participates in 3 rounds; A, B, and C.</p>
<p>Project <span class="hashtag-raw">#1</span> which participates in 1 round hits the matching cap and receives 5% of the pool for that round. They received 5x the unique votes as the next most popular project - but 4/5ths of their supporters don’t get matched since they hit the matching cap.  Project <span class="hashtag-raw">#2</span> meanwhile also hits the matching cap, even though they only had 1/5th of the support of Project <span class="hashtag-raw">#1</span>.</p>
<p>That all is okay and is how we’ve done matching caps historically ^ However now, we’re saying that because Project <span class="hashtag-raw">#2</span> fit within 3 categories- they now get to exceed the matching cap for Round A, in practice. Maybe they hit that cap for B and C too (but just barely) and so now we have penalized projects which had more supporters via the matching cap, but privileged a project whose supporters split their support across multiple rounds. (Spoiler: this is a big sybil/airdropper technique and is generally executed via script against our contracts). So Project <span class="hashtag-raw">#2</span> has now bagged 3x as much of the reward as we intended to “cap” a single project from receiving; 15% of any single matching pool if we assume equal distribution and equal cap across all our rounds.</p>
<p>This seems in bad faith to me, and so matching caps per round feel mutually exclusive with projects participating in more than one round simultaneously… Recognizing that at the end of the day this is Gitcoin’s matching pool split into 5 buckets- same pool, same funder.</p>
<p>That said, if I’m a partner and I want to encourage projects who are located in a certain geographical region, this is independent of whatever funding those projects may receive from Gitcoin. I want to give them a “bonus” essentially for building in the region-- so they get their funds from Gitcoin’s grant pool and then a bonus from my grant pool.  This is a new bucket of money- so I feel that partners controlling their own eligibility criteria feels perfectly fine, here.</p>
<p>Would love to hear community sentiment- as again, this is something that may not have been widely acknowledged in previous rounds. Would be great to have it worked out for Gitcoin’s own case.</p>

[Discussion & Feedback Request] Gitcoin Program Beta Round Eligibility
koday

            <p>Thank you all for the amazing suggestions and open discussion here!</p>
<p><strong>Quick update</strong> - we’re planning on leaving this post open for discussion but will likely lock in the eligibility requirements by the end of the week (March 31st). I plan to make a revised post and clearly label what has been added or changed since this draft.</p>
<p>At that point, we may begin to share the requirements with past grantees and/or publically on our social channels as we start to generate interest in the Beta Round. Grant applications are tentatively scheduled to open on April 11th.</p>
<p>I’d also like to add some input on the suggestions we’ve got floating around here:</p>

<p>As we continue to grow, it would make sense to clarify how round eligibility changes over time (how and by whom). This clarification will help us avoid future disagreements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I completely agree Shawn - as mentioned above I plan to make a revised gov post at the end of the week that highlights the changes made to this criteria. However, the way we choose what to change or add is unclear. I’d like to strike a balance between the two ends of the spectrum - i.e. one person making that decision and going to snapshot vote for every rule change. For this round I was thinking we could host a call with the PGF team and open it to all DAO core contributors, and do smaller-scale live voting on some of the proposed changes. I’m curious to hear what your thoughts are around this topic.</p>

<p>By this we mean I guess, an org having multiple grants for multiple of their subprojects in as many different rounds as possile. This should not be allowed. The organization behind the grant should be identified and if the same, then disallowed to have multiple grants in different rounds to maximize return.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree that an org should not be able to have multiple grants/subprojects that roll up into their org and I think any orgs that try to do this should be considered for a ban from future grants rounds.</p>

<p>No. They shouldn’t. It may not be enforceable, but you’all could require that grants disclose that the multiple projects are affiliated and, if later, it’s found out that people did not disclose this, they could be disqualified.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I also like TJ’s suggestion as a way to enforce this policy considering it may not be explicitly clear to round operators.</p>

<p>It is my suggestion that for the beta round, each project is able to join 1 and only 1 of these 5 core rounds; but can be considered automatically for inclusion in any of our amazing partner-matching featured rounds.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>After reflecting on this, I actually do think a single grant should be able to qualify for multiple core rounds. With the current architecture the donations in each round would count separately for matching, and if they meet the eligibility criteria of more than one round I don’t see why they shouldn’t be able to pull funding from those sources. Otherwise, we are essentially asking them to conduct some game theory-esque analysis on which round is the most beneficial for them to join and that may never be a clear-cut answer.</p>
<p>Also, this functionality was present in most, if not all, cGrants rounds, so changing this policy to ‘1 grant, 1 round’ seems like a much bigger change than letting this continue. The only difference now is that they need separate donations in each round to count for matching instead of allocating multiple sources of matching funds from 1 larger set of donations.</p>
<p>I’ll leave it at that for now to keep this comment at a reasonable length but will be adding more responses to other points in the coming days <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=12" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
