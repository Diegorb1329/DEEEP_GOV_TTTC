$500m worth (at the time) of AKITA was donated to the gitcoin community multisig.

This is an illiquid token so market selling for the actual value is impossible. Little to nothing is known for the plans of the AKITA project (is it just a meme coin?) so holding for a longer period of time may lead to loss of all of its value.

- Would giving it back make sense?
- Market Sell with insane (~98%) slippage?
- Keep it?
- Something else?

What should the gitcoin community do with these funds? Remember. Gitcoin's purpose is to fund open source (and public goods).

            <p>Is there anyone who would be able to comment on the status of this issue?</p>
<p>The recent report on the DAO (here: <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-financial-reporting/8867" class="inline-onebox">GitCoin Financial Reporting</a>) makes no mention of this issue.</p>
<p>Perhaps the two issues are unrelated?</p>
<p>Sorry to have lost context here. As I‚Äôm sure many would agree, it‚Äôs quite difficult to keep up with everything that‚Äôs going on‚Ä¶</p>

            <p>To me the akita project is becoming a dead one‚Ä¶ keeping it hoping for a better future is too high hope. Selling it with high slippage is fairly okay than returning it back</p>

            <p>While true from an economics-based perspective, I think pretty much all suggestions around holding/investing/burning are also trying to protect against non-economic vectors, e.g potentially having to deal with a very angered community.</p>

            <p>Just an idea. What about making what Gitcoin does best? community and Hackathons? Why not an Akita Hackathon. Akita devs could be the ones to organize the hackathon to help  their project out of a the meme get rich quick scheme (that‚Äôs how it started) then funding  the project could go around public goods projects that serve every community not only Akita‚Äôs, this way we could welcome hackers from the Akita community to the Quadratic lands. I don‚Äôt think the Akita community should be dismissed, but if the Akita community is selling themselves as a community  with a plan, why not build it like any other project? and not just by tapping into people trying to get in at an ‚Äúearly Doge‚Äù. In this Hackathon some of the tokens can be given as prizes, some can be donated to grants, some could be burned, some could be sold for a purpose. It‚Äôs up to Akita to show their willingness to cooperate insto building something useful and not the other way around. Show us you are not just greedy people using your community for a profit, bring them on and BUIDL. I by no means want to rug dump onto a huge amount of people living a dream they were sold, I would wish they could come and build that dream.</p>

            <p>One further piece of food for thought: Any proposal that suggests holding AKITA or burning it should consider fungibility and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Endowment Effect</a>.</p>
<p>Put simply: If GitCoin had whatever amount of money the AKITA could be reasonably sold for, and a free choice of what to do with it, would they choose to buy and hold/burn AKITA tokens? If the answer is no, it‚Äôs not rational to do so just because GitCoin already has the tokens.</p>

            <p>I would personally sell it and use the funds to set up a fund to send ETH to proof-of-human bag holders‚Ä¶ Sure they might just use the ETH to buy more Akita or Shiba or‚Ä¶ <em>checks notes</em> ‚ÄúSafeDog‚Äù‚Ä¶</p>
<p>But it‚Äôs better than the current situation as mentioned above where they essentially get bled out over the next few months by experienced traders and bots‚Ä¶</p>

            <p>in trading and investor wise, one of the highest possibility would be that the moment a immediate liquidation of akita is approval and accepted, the price of Akita would crashed to near zero as investor pull out their funds.  it‚Äôs like 1929 where people withdraw their money from banks as soon as they know the situation.</p>
<p>so instead of the few hundreds of millions dollars gitcoin would like to extract when they approach liquidating akita in any form.  It is too easy for these meme token to crash.  there are similar crash in other tokens when adverts information is released.</p>
<p><strong>Any proposal to liquidate in any form, no matter the duration</strong><br>
current price: $0.000002106<br>
crash price: $0.0000000002 (estimated)<br>
worth at crash price: $2millions<br>
presume gitcoin 50% liquidation take home value : $1million</p>
<p><strong>relic proposal and price goes back to ath</strong><br>
back to ath price: $0.00003346<br>
worth at ath price: $3,346,000,000 ($3.3billions)<br>
relic proposal of burning 45% and keeping 5% : $3.3billions* 5% = $167millions</p>
<p><strong>relic proposal and price goes back to midpoint</strong><br>
back to midpoint price: ($0.00003346 - 0.000002106)/2 + 0.000002106 = 0.000017783<br>
worth at midpoint price: $1,778,300,000 ($1.7billions)<br>
relic proposal of burning 45% and keeping 5% : $1.7billions* 5% = $88 millions</p>

            <p>Definitely a good option and a win-win situation here. If Gitcoin can get a little benefit from making a burn happen and ease some stress on the Akita community that would make good publicity for Gitcoin as well. I think a 10-15 % in ETH/DAI of the total value would be a correct deal. At the end of the day everybody would be happy and this topic can be closed.</p>
