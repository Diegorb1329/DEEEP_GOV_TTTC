https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/2022-roadmap-2022-goals/9613
    Hello everyone,

Wow, its already 2022!  I'd love to start a thread for us to coordinate our 2022 goals across the workstreams in the DAO.    

If successful, I may put together an infographic that shows the DAO's roadmap.  And I think it would be really great if each workstream knew what each other one was targeting for 2022.

2022 Roadmap & 2022 Goals
OmnistratMatt

            <p>Here is a video (<a href="https://bit.ly/34S6Tim" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Omnistrat - down and dirty DAO demo - YouTube</a>) of Gitcoin‚Äôs 2022 Goals laid out in an interactive visualization.</p>
<p>I used Gitcoin‚Äôs goals as a demo of a prototype for a DAO coordination tooling project I‚Äôm working on. This project isn‚Äôt ready for public use, though. Still gathering feedback.</p>
<p>P.S. I posted earlier in the thread on this but had the wrong link.</p>

            <p>This picture of the Graph is almost exactly the way FDD is structured.</p>
<p>Put FDD where ‚ÄúData &amp; APIs‚Äù is</p>
<p>Replace Working group with ‚ÄúTop Level Goals‚Äù. These include Sybil Defense, Grants Eligibility, and sustainability.</p>
<p>Under each of these are the outcomes they have agreed to execute on. If you dig deeper, you will also see that these outcome squads each develop their own 90 day okrs for each season as well. See more on our <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QuQcozQtKV2vukzYp2u9z-wW60uV3egs9mlX9orHFMI/edit?usp=sharing">FDD Weekly Update</a> slides.</p>
<p>More interesting to me is on the left where their diagram shows ‚ÄúContributors‚Äù. (Somewhat confusing with the way we use the term for GitcoinDAO.)</p>
<p>For FDD, the input to the system has an extra layer here that is similar to the inputs they list as ‚Äúcontributors‚Äù. This is the FDD multisig. It adds a layer of input and protection for the DAO. It helps to convey information and protect resources</p>
<p>The FDD multisig comprised of individuals who represent our stakeholders.</p>
<p>Some represent the other working groups we connect with the most. Our ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù in a Jobs To Be Done model.<br>
(Grants Ops = Annika, Support = Bob)</p>
<p>Some represent deep subject matter expertise.<br>
(Angela / Token Engeneering Academy, Michael Zargham / Blockscience, Adam Stallard / BrightID)</p>
<p>Lastly some to represent the contributors: Armand &amp; Myself.</p>
<p>I guess it is time to write up a post on the FDD emerging structure!</p>

            <p>I have seen that format used by other projects in the past.  I like it and support using it here.  I especially like the ability to add new rows as they appear and how the time can be stretched horizontally if a precise time is unknown.<br>
Trying to remember where I saw it‚Ä¶will share here if I can find it.</p>

<p>wed welcome input into what format would help convey the roadmap to the world.</p>
<p>i was thinking something like this might be a good way to display what were up to.  i think the simplicity of it is powerful: (note: the milestones in the image are just for illustrative purposes, not a promise of any outcome)</p>

            <p>We did a lot of retro and strategy planning in January (15 + hours) and chose 18 outcomes for the next 90 days with three success metrics for each. Each outcome falls under one of our ‚ÄúTop Level Goals‚Äù which are the metrics we want to use and improve round over round. Details on the 18 outcomes can be found on our <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QuQcozQtKV2vukzYp2u9z-wW60uV3egs9mlX9orHFMI/edit?usp=sharing">FDD Weekly Update</a> slides.

2022 Roadmap & 2022 Goals

            <p>Sean from MMM here. We‚Äôre running a series of planning sessions right now. Current thinking is to have four key themes that are something like this with specific objectives and key results for each:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build the growth machine</li>
<li>Build a leading web3 brand</li>
<li>Support DAO workstreams</li>
<li>MMM workstream health<br>
We plan to gather feedback on a full draft by EOW and finalize them by end of next week!</li>

            <p>FDD will be holding our Q1 strategy sessions between 1/12 - 1/17. I don‚Äôt want to post the goals before our collaborative decision making process. First, to not ‚Äúlead the witness‚Äù in deciding our path. Second, to not create confusion if what I think of first were to change.</p>

            <p>+100 on these, in terms of some of the other OKRs we‚Äôll be formalizing, check out our objectives in the <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-public-goods-are-good-pgf-q1-budget-request/9416">Q1 PGF budget</a></p>
<p>One key thing I want to note as others think about their OKRs: our highest order objective is to <em>increase the GMV of Gitcoin Grants and related public goods funding mechanisms</em> so that we can sustain the web3 ecosystem. There are many ways to accomplish this, but I‚Äôd encourage everyone to go through their objectives and ask ‚ÄúHow does this help us more effectively build and fund public goods?‚Äù</p>
<p>In terms of specific OKRs for Q1</p>
<p><strong>Grassroots Efforts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Help &gt;500 new entrants to web3 understand why public goods are good via public goods PR</li>
<li>Greenpill &gt;20 new contributors across the library via the public library</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Grants Ops</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Annika‚Äôs objectives above have been ratified and are good to go!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Public Goods Partnerships</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Organize and execute on a framework for rank-ordering potential values-aligned partners</li>
<li>Help seed 3 additional public goods projects like <a href="https://twitter.com/0xPARC">0xPARC</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/verses_xyz">Verses</a> via micro-grants</li>
<li>Find at least 3 values aligned partners to conduct token swaps with to push meta-governance in the space forward</li>

<p>I have a dream for Gitcoin User Support (it is on Discord now) by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>‚Äì First User support is not only for our end user, but also support the contributors like recruiment, onboarding, growth, retainment etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is permissionless for joining Gitcoin support team (it is permissioned now)</li>
<li>Everyone could do the support in their free time.</li>
<li>Once their support reaches a pre-defined threshold, they will get rewarded.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to best service Gitcoin user, we not only need the Discord support, but also the great content (from knowledge base or user guides), so</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a rich (Support) knowledge base (rather than <a href="https://support.gitcoin.co/kb/" class="inline-onebox">Knowledge Base - Gitcoin Support</a>)</li>
<li>Encourage the community to contribute to the knowledge base</li>
<li>Contributors will get rewarded for their efforts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please leave your thoughts about the support.</p>
