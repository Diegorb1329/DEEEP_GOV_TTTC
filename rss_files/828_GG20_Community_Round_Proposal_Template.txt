GG20 Community Round Proposal Template
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-community-round-proposal-template/18122
    For those who would like to apply to be a community round in GG20 and apply for matching from Gitcoin, below is the proposal template to work off of and a breakdown of the process. **PLEASE NOTE:** There is NO minimum matching required to apply!

**TL;DR of the process:**

To be eligible to run a community round in GG20, each community needs to upload their proposal to our gov forum (with the outlined template below).
After the deadline for proposals, the [GG20 Community Council](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-community-council/17749) will review and vote on which rounds to accept into the round, and how to allocate matching funds to each of them.

## Community Round Governance - GG20

Here’s a breakdown of GG20’s governance process and a rundown of how the Council will be involved on the process we will follow to select community rounds:

**Week 1: Gitcoin team posts eligibility criteria & agreements to gov forum [week of Feb 12th]**

**Week 1-3: Community Round partners complete and post their proposal to the gov forum.**

* Community Round partners to create a proposal that they post on the gov forum.

**Week 3: Deadline for proposals [March 17th]**

* A full list of Community Rounds are available for the GG20 Community Council to review.

**Week 3 - 4: Review & voting period [March 18 - 22nd]**

* The proposals are reviewed by the GG20 Community Council and go to a vote
* The decision of the vote is published on the gov forum.

**Week 4 - 6: Results and onboarding period [March 25 - 29]**

* The Community Rounds are onboarded into the upcoming round.

**PLEASE NOTE:** If you want to run a round during GG20, but you don't want to apply for matching, you may do so but this does not automatically guarantee that you will be officially part of GG20 and our marketing efforts. We will market rounds that run alongside GG20 (without our matching) only if they are very well established, values-aligned rounds to the discretion of our team. To officially be part of GG20, each community needs to go through this new governance process. 

### When drafting a proposal, please include the following information:

The proposal will be posted on the Gitcoin gov forum as a new post. **Please note:** Review the ratified [GG20 Community Round eligibility criteria](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/review-gg20-eligibility-criteria-community-rounds/17846) and agreements while creating your proposal.

Deadline to submit for GG20: **March 17th at 11:59pm UTC**

GG20 donations will go live end of April.

* **Name (or Topic/Theme) of Proposed Round**
  * *The name can always change, but capturing the essence of the area you’d like to focus on is important.*
  * * *Please include the social handle of your org*
* **How many times has this round been run during a Gitcoin Grants round?**
  * *If you are running a new version of an old round, please specify the details.*
*  * Please specify if you are unsure how to answer because you lack historical context.*
* **How big is your team that will run this round? Who is your team?**
  * * *Please include all social handle links*
  * *We recommend having at least 3 - 4 people who will be reviewers/round operators.*
* **How does this round align with Gitcoin’s [mission](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/update-gitcoins-adopted-mission-and-vision-statements/15039) and [essential intents](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/update-gitcoin-s-ratified-essential-intents-2023-2024-and-a-recap-of-our-successes/16818)?**
* **What do you anticipate the size of the matching pool will be (either fundraised from partners, raised independently through your connections, or a combination of both)?**
  * *Please realistically estimate based on existing relationships and demonstrated interest.*
  * *Please include the funding address.*
* **Who will be advisors for this round, if anyone?**
* **Please describe the eligibility criteria you envision for this proposed round.**
  * *For example: to be in the Climate Solutions Round, your project must primarily focus on climate action. [see this example of eligibility criteria for the last grant rounds](https://gitcoin.notion.site/GG19-Eligibility-50843c8b3ab44ad297731a00efa6e389?pvs=4)*.
  * **Reminder:** All rounds must comply with Gitcoin's core rules, which include no fraudulent activity, quid pro quo, hate speech, or other activities out of alignment with Gitcoin's essential intents. Please include all additional eligibility criteria specific to this proposed grants round.
* **How large is your community approximately?**
* **What type of projects would you like to fund?**
* **Approximately how many grantees do you believe will be eligible to apply to this round?**
  * *The amount of grantees that your round attracts is a very clear indicator of whether it will succeed.*
* **Impact Assessment: If and how do you intend to assess grantee impact over successive rounds? This could include, but is not limited to Hypercerts, GAP, Deresy, etc.**
  * *This is not mandatory, but it’s something to consider for future grantee eligibility, and it is a strong cornerstone of how Matching Fund partners might assess funding opportunities.*
* **Is there anything else that community members should consider when voting for which rounds to focus on in the upcoming GG20 grants round?**

GG20 Community Round Proposal Template
necyk

            <p>I am unable to create a post, so I was advised to post our GG20 proposal here until it is resolved.</p>
<p><strong>Name (or Topic/Theme) of Proposed Round</strong></p>
<p>GG20 Proposal: Psychedelic Community Round: the creation of fun, educational, and accessible psychedelic content and live events with DAO governance</p>
<p>Twitter: ShowPsychedelic</p>
<p>Instagram: PsychedelicPuppetShow</p>
<p><strong>How many times has this round been run during a Gitcoin Grants round?</strong></p>
<p>Our organization is ready to launch its own Gitcoin round, having engaged in regular consultations with Ben West since May 2023 to prepare for this initiative. We deliberately delayed our round to ensure a clear strategic direction and a comprehensive understanding of our needs. Following extensive organizational development and a series of DAO planning workshops, we have crystallized our vision for conducting a successful Gitcoin round.</p>
<p>Our track record as a grantee in the past two rounds speaks to our capability and success in executing impactful projects. Specifically, we successfully utilized the funds to host our inaugural live film festival in New York City on May 7, 2024, and to support two months of weekly workshops that fostered creative envisioning and draft an initial whitepaper for the organizations future development plans.</p>
<p><strong>How big is your team that will run this round? Who is your team?</strong></p>
<p>The Psychedelic Puppet Show Non-Profit hosts a dedicated board of four members: Dr. Brad Necyk (Instagram/Twitter bradnecyk), Dr. Pam Kryskow, Aaron Munson (Instagram aamunson), and Scott Nelson. Additionally, we have strengthened our team by appointing Brad Necyk as Executive Director and Ona Praderas as our Community Engagement Officer.</p>
<p>Our network extends to renowned figures in the field, including Paul Stamets (famed myscologist, Twitter/Instagram paulstamets), Rick Doblin (founder of MAPS), Jason Silva (TV personality, Twitter/Instagram jasonsilva), Alex and Allyson Grey (famed artists, Twitter/Instagram alexgreycosm), as well as key psychedelic organizations such as MAPS (Instagram maps_org), Psychedelic Assembly (Instagram psychedelic_assembly), Propeller (Instragram propeller.la, Psychedelic Association of Canada (Instagram psychedelicassociation), District216 (Instagram district216official), and Psychedelic SF Gallery (Instagram psychedelicsfgallery), among others.</p>
<p>To ensure the integrity and alignment of our grant review process, our board members will serve as the primary reviewers. This approach guarantees that all proposals are evaluated thoroughly to align with our mission and values.</p>
<p><strong>How does this round align with Gitcoin’s mission 5?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we do align with Gitcoin’s mission and essential interests, as our focus in this round is to lay the groundwork for a global, decentralized, and self-governed community that raises psychedelic awareness and adds the public good. We believe that cutting-edge technologies such as digital media, AI, and blockchain can enable this vision. We believe in a read, write, generate, and own platform that empowers and compensated creators and contributors.</p>
<p>We are planning to contribute $10,000 USD in matching funds from a private Bitcoin donation we received in November of 2023.</p>
<p>ETH address: 0xadaa3b0d9b96df7e338b6db62e7daa073e0e94a5</p>
<p><strong>Who will be advisors for this round, if anyone?</strong></p>
<p>Scott Nelson (long-term web3 investor), Shawn Anderson (blockchain engineer and founder of Long Tail Financial), Adam Szymanski (Art Consultant specializing in NFTs), and Ben West (Gitcoin).</p>
<p>Please describe the eligibility criteria you envision for this proposed round.</p>
<p>In a broad way, every project must enhance our core vision of creating a decentralized community that creates fun, educational, and accessible content around psychedelic science, therapy, cultural practices, historical uses, or spirituality.</p>
<p>Each project must fit into one or more of these three areas: artist creations, live events, or DAO governance.</p>
<p>Each project must be willing to collaborate with our organization for the realization and launch of each project.</p>
<p><strong>How large is your community approximately?</strong></p>
<p>We have a growing number of thought leaders in the psychedelic space but are very excited to begin including and empowering creators worldwide. With the help of our social media platforms and the amplification of content through Paul Stamets and Jason Silva, our current content has reached over a million people. We aim to bring more creators into this community and share their visions and stories.</p>
<p><strong>What type of projects would you like to fund?</strong></p>
<p>In our inaugural year as a non-profit, we achieved significant milestones, such as producing media with leading figures in the psychedelic field, launching our first psychedelic film festival in New York City, and securing funding through Gitcoin and a private Bitcoin donation, enabling us to hire two new team members and offer $10,000 in matching funds for this round.</p>
<p>Collaborating with a web developer, a blockchain engineer, and a postdoctoral AI researcher, we are crafting a whitepaper focused on community networking, AI tooling, and blockchain integration.</p>
<p>For the upcoming Gitcoin round, we are eager to attract innovative proposals that will help expand our organization in three key areas, consistent with our mission, values, and strategic growth plans:</p>
<ol>
<li>Artistic Projects: We seek to fund projects that produce fun, educational, and accessible content related to psychedelic science, therapy, cultural practices, historical uses, and spirituality.</li>
<li>Live Events: We aim to support events that combine film, art, music, readings, and public discussions, with the potential for global hosting, to foster community engagement and idea exchange.</li>
<li>DAO Governance: We are committed to establishing and enhancing a community-governed DAO, focusing on strategic planning, infrastructure development, and launch.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Approximately how many grantees do you believe will be eligible to apply to this round?</strong></p>
<p>We are committed to funding 6-8 outstanding projects that promise sustainable growth and long-term benefits for our organization and community. With five core contributors currently driving our vision forward, we are keen to welcome additional individuals and organizations. Their fresh perspectives and innovative approaches will undoubtedly enrich and expand our capabilities beyond what we could achieve independently. We are enthusiastic about the prospect of incorporating new voices into our project, enhancing its diversity and impact.</p>
<p><strong>Impact Assessment: If and how do you intend to assess grantee impact over successive rounds? This could include, but is not limited to Hypercerts, GAP, Deresy, etc.</strong></p>
<p>In collaboration with Shawn Anderson from Longtail Financial, we will explore the potential of Hypercerts and DeReSy to enhance our grant assessment process. Hypercerts could be used to create a transparent, verifiable record of a project’s impact, allowing us to track and reward achievements effectively. These tokens would enable us to retrospectively fund projects based on their proven impact, fostering a more dynamic and responsive funding model.</p>
<p>With DeReSy, we could implement a robust system for on-chain project reviews, providing clear, immutable assessments of each project’s progress and outcomes. This would allow for transparent and objective evaluations, facilitating better decision-making for future grant allocations.</p>
<p>By working with Longtail Financial, we aim to integrate these technologies into our grant-making process, ensuring that we fund projects that offer significant, verifiable impact. This strategic collaboration will help us leverage cutting-edge blockchain technology to make more informed and impactful funding decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything else that community members should consider when voting for which rounds to focus on in the upcoming GG20 grants round?</strong></p>
<p>Our organization, dedicated to promoting public good, believes in the transformative power of psychedelics and the arts towards making a better world. We view artists as essential in shaping public perception and preparing society for the changes psychedelics can bring. Recognizing the value of their work, we advocate for fair compensation for artists. Through this funding round, we aim to support projects that establish enduring, sustainable contributions to our organization and vision, empowering artists to create and disseminate their work, thereby influencing global consciousness positively.</p>

<ul>
<li>Link out to the social handles of all operators</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>link out to the org’s social handle</li>
<li>funding address</li>
</ul>
<p>This is to make it easier for the council to identify team members and orgs across applicants due to the fact that they are not familiar with everyone. Thank you!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We’d have our main matching pool (probably around 5 ETH) be reserved for single-project grants, but we also want to experiment with funding collaborations between projects. If we set aside 1 or 2 ETH for this, would we be allowed to run that as a parallel submission process for direct grants? Or would it simplify things if we ran this experiment on its own after GG20?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>From what I understand, it sounds like you are asking whether you can request funds for two rounds during GG20. If so, I would recommend one submission per entity per round.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We’re thinking about doing this on Arbitrum, if we can secure matching from them - but would Gitcoin have conditions around double-matching? i.e. could we have our matching pool (around 5 ETH) partially or fully matching by multiple matching donors?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is 100% ok! It’s quite common for communities to get funding from various funders, so this is very much acceptable. We are running our main round, OSS, on Arbitrum and we’re personally also excited about that partnership.</p>

<p>If goals are met, some kind of impact certification (maybe Hypercert) can be issued by OpenCivics, tailored to the particular impact made by the grantee, and this cert can then be leveraged for successive grant applications, to convey to donors a track record of setting realistic impact goals and meeting them.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Love this idea! We are in the middle of codifying our own impact measurements and how it ties into standards being created with partners such as Open Source Observer and our OSS round. We highly encourage impact tracking for round operators.</p>
<p>All of what you outlines sounds very exciting and we can’t wait to receive your proposal! Please lmk if you have any further questions.</p>

            <p>We’re also trying to work out some impact evaluation/attestation system whereby grantees specify their intended impact milestones (perhaps with tiered projections corresponding to potential funding amounts they receive), grants are given, OpenCivics checks in on the grantee periodically to gauge progress toward impact goals, and before the following round OpenCivics determines if those goals were met.</p>
<p>If goals are met, some kind of impact certification (maybe Hypercert) can be issued by OpenCivics, tailored to the particular impact made by the grantee, and this cert can then be leveraged for successive grant applications, to convey to donors a track record of setting realistic impact goals and meeting them.</p>
<p>Ideally, this process can be templatized such that other grantors can implement them with their own grant programs, but we’re also trying to avoid reinventing the wheel. We’re looking into IRS form 990, which pertains to nonprofit impact/activity reporting, but we’re curious if anyone else here knows of other existing means for tracking progress between “tranches” of grants given.</p>

            <p>Thanks for posting this! We’re planning out our next round for OpenCivics, and starting to get a good sense of how this next round of ours (our second grant round) will work.</p>
<p>Just a couple questions:</p>
<p>Like our last round, we will be providing funding to civics/advocacy related projects which have joined the OpenCivics consortium, which is free. The idea here is for the grant round itself to operate as a funding allocation mechanism for the consortium itself, with outsider voters/donors influencing how this funding should be allocated.</p>
<p>We’d have our main matching pool (probably around 5 ETH) be reserved for single-project grants, but we also want to experiment with funding collaborations between projects. If we set aside 1 or 2 ETH for this, would we be allowed to run that as a parallel submission process for direct grants? Or would it simplify things if we ran this experiment on its own after GG20?</p>
<p>We’re thinking about doing this on Arbitrum, if we can secure matching from them - but would Gitcoin have conditions around double-matching? i.e. could we have our matching pool (around 5 ETH) partially or fully matching by multiple matching donors?</p>

            <p>We have decided to extend the deadline to March 17th 11:59pm UTC. This allows a bit more time for communities to get their applications in, esp in the wake of ETH Denver.</p>

            <p>For those who would like to apply to be a community round in GG20 and apply for matching from Gitcoin, below is the proposal template to work off of and a breakdown of the process. <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> There is NO minimum matching required to apply!</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR of the process:</strong></p>
<p>To be eligible to run a community round in GG20, each community needs to upload their proposal to our gov forum (with the outlined template below).<br>
After the deadline for proposals, the <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-community-council/17749">GG20 Community Council</a> will review and vote on which rounds to accept into the round, and how to allocate matching funds to each of them.</p>
<h2><a name="community-round-governance-gg20-1" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#community-round-governance-gg20-1"></a>Community Round Governance - GG20</h2>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of GG20’s governance process and a rundown of how the Council will be involved on the process we will follow to select community rounds:</p>
<p><strong>Week 1: Gitcoin team posts eligibility criteria &amp; agreements to gov forum [week of Feb 12th]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Week 1-3: Community Round partners complete and post their proposal to the gov forum.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Community Round partners to create a proposal that they post on the gov forum.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Week 3: Deadline for proposals [March 17th]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A full list of Community Rounds are available for the GG20 Community Council to review.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Week 3 - 4: Review &amp; voting period [March 18 - 22nd]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The proposals are reviewed by the GG20 Community Council and go to a vote</li>
<li>The decision of the vote is published on the gov forum.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Week 4 - 6: Results and onboarding period [March 25 - 29]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Community Rounds are onboarded into the upcoming round.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> If you want to run a round during GG20, but you don’t want to apply for matching, you may do so but this does not automatically guarantee that you will be officially part of GG20 and our marketing efforts. We will market rounds that run alongside GG20 (without our matching) only if they are very well established, values-aligned rounds to the discretion of our team. To officially be part of GG20, each community needs to go through this new governance process.</p>
