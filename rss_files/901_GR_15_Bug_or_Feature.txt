https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gr-15-bug-or-feature/11522
    I've been facing some issues with my lease since the GR14 and now on the GR15 I can't see the matching value to each dollar. My grants now for every 100 dollars I receive 1, is there any reason why the grants are like this? Is the quadratic distribution algorithm not working for all grants? I would like help from users and delegates holding gtc to understand what is happening with grants.

            <p>So the problem is that it is the second round in a row that I have a problem, and in the last round I met the requirements, because I worked for aurora and for polygon. however I was removed from the polygon and gitcoin pools.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m a big believer in the project, but Iâ€™m really not happy with how things are working out. In the last round there was even a celebration of the funds that remained in the pool, but if they stayed it was because they were not distributed. I even thought I was attacked by spam but I was not notified.</p>

            <p>From my view, this could be correct.</p>
<p>From the grant explorer, you can see the top grants with thousands of donors, which might impact the QF matching funds strongly.</p>
<p>Comparing you have 4 contributors now, you could get 1/1000 or even less matching funds than the top grants. (Number of contributors matter than the funds)</p>
<p>Here is a brief introduction and simulation for QF - <a href="https://wtfisqf.com/">https://wtfisqf.com/</a></p>

            <p>Heya! Great question - in this case because you have donations from 4 contributors, the matching amount is going to be small and I suspect it is accurate.</p>
<p>Gitcoin has grown quite a lot and some of the top grants now see thousands of contributors, which means that grants with less than 50 contributions dont get much matching.</p>
<p>We have been getting feedback that some folks in our community wish we had more support for OSS, so in GR16 we may do a round just for OSS devs like yourself <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

  <p>The opensource funding challenge, I'm currently a full time bounty hunter and opensource contributor, yes I do what I love, but it comes at a cost I can't always get paid for the bountys I participate and the hackthons I win. This has great weight in...</p>
