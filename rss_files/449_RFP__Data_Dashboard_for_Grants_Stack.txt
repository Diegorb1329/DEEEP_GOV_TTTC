            <p>Excited about this RFP and sharing the link to this post with several Gitcoin Citizens!</p>
<p>One suggestion from a data access perspective as applicants read this thread: imo given the number of different chains we are on (and constantly adding) ‚Äì this will be much better/easier to build and maintain using the indexer, <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/regendata-xyz-our-sybil-resistant-future-q3-2023-and-beyond/16474">regendata</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/davidgasquez/gitcoin-grants-data-portal" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">data portal</a> than something like dune.</p>

            <p>hey <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/distributeddoge">@DistributedDoge</a> thanks for reading through so closely!</p>
<p><code>1</code> contest format: we‚Äôve heard from other direct grant programs that this works well, but I think you make a good point about a deadline ‚Äì let me see if we can add!</p>
<p><code>2</code> dune dashboard: since PGN data is pretty hard to access, we will accept a dune dashboard or similar ‚Äì but we also linked to our indexer which contains data on all of the chains we support!</p>

            <p>Looks neat, my only two nitpicks are:</p>
<p>EDIT: Ok, so I found out this is indeed a contest, where you intend to pick best of all submissions, so it would be nice to have some sort of clear deadline as to when to submit.</p>
<p>Also, you are asking for Dune dashboard - for now Dune has no live access to Public Goods Network data where a lot of action is happening. Dealers choice if you want folks to import stale PGN data into Dune or just ignore PGN component for now.</p>

            <p>I am excited to see the Grants Stack team engaging the community in this way.  I think its an interesting experiment in dogfooding Grants Stack, and also in modularizing the work done around the Grants Stack team so that the community can jump in &amp; accelerate the work.</p>
<p>Keen to see the data dashboards of course too <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
