## [ü§ñ Meta-Governance](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/governance-meta/6)

* [@ceresstation](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation) announced the start of [Constructing a Mutual Grants Committee](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/constructing-a-mutual-grants-committee/10347) as opportunities continue to emerge to align with partners who are committed to a public goods related mission. The committee will fill the current lack of formalization behind mutual grant agreements. Stewards and members of the Public goods funding-Workstream are invited to join a working group

* The discussion about a [Partnership and Mutual Grant with Wonder](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-partnership-mutual-grant-with-wonder/10170/30) now includes takes from several community members and Stewards. Those in favor generally approve of reducing the grant to 50k GTC from 100k and point out that Wonder is being built by KERNEL alumni. Those against the proposal point out that Wonder is not yet open-source, and does not appear to have a clear or special strategy to build a public good.

* [Huxwell](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/huxwell/summary) gives an [update on the dCompass](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-dcompass-release-plan-and-beyond/10356/6) project nearing alpha release and asks the community for advice on how to continue funding the project. Check out the [staging app](https://dcompass-staging.herokuapp.com/) now!

* In [DAO Design Best Practices](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/dao-design-best-practices/10219/9), [David_Dyor](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/david_dyor/summary) and [Layn](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/layn/summary) describe how Gitcoin does not have an IRP (Incident Response Plan) like the ones used by organizations to respond to emergencies or natural disasters. David encourages Layn to start drafting an IRP for Gitcoin and Layn updates us on their [research findings](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/irp-research-for-gitcoin/10340). Few DAOs have IRPs but MakerDAO notably has a well-documented [Emergency Shutdown](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/shutdown) plan.

* [Bob](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/bobjiang/summary) gives [Gitcoin grants advice based on [his] observations](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grant-advices-based-on-my-observations/10317) that grantees did not have enough information about the status their grant was in and why. He proposes creating additional grant statuses to provide greater granularity and detail to the grantee.

<p>We are hosting a <a href="https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&amp;tmeid=MTB0NnJzMnJ1MjU0bW5xMW81bWd1c3VrNXEgam9lQGdpdGNvaW4uY28&amp;tmsrc=joe%40gitcoin.co" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Big Sybil Event</a> on Monday 4/18 to collectively build a roadmap for the future of our sybil defense efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our Season 13 Contributor Experience survey found that many FDD contributors see themselves as co-creators, share enthusiasm, and feel on fire! However, some contributors experience ambiguity and uncertainty around roles and responsibilities. We are looking into improving ourselves continually by more clearly defining roles, making information easier to find, and establishing feedback loops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Season 14 OKRs, outcomes, and deliverables are being planned this week with feedback from the leadership retreat attended by Disruption Joe &amp; Tigress from FDD</p>
