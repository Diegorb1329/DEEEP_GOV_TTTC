    ## Overview

Over the past 3â€“4 years, the Regen movement has attracted an abundantly passionate community dedicated to advancing the regenerative movement on Ethereum, often without full recognition or compensation for their work. This inaugural grant round aimed to publicly recognize and celebrate such contributions. It was an opportunity to honor the tireless work of community members while laying foundations for broader participation in the future.

We extend our heartfelt thanks to Gitcoin for their generous $12,500 in matching funds, as well as to our sponsoring organizationsâ€”Celo Public Goods, ReFi DAO, Greenpill Network, and Let's GROW DAOâ€”for contributing $8,500 to the matching pool. This round was made possible by the collective efforts of operators, contributors, participants, and the broader community, whose dedication and collaboration brought the Regen Citizens Genesis Round to life and made it a meaningful success.

## Key Stats:

* Matching Pool: $21,000
* Total Participants: 60
* Total Donations: $8,868 (42% of the total matching pool & 71% of Gitcoinâ€™s contribution)
* Unique Contributors: 491
* Total Contributions: 2,891
* Matching Algorithm: 100% COCM

## Nomination Process

To ensure meaningful distribution of funds amongst the participants, we capped the number of participants at 60 for this inaugural round. Each sponsoring organization was allocated 20 nomination slots to self-identify their most valuable and active community members. To enhance inclusivity, sponsoring organizations also invited 2-3 additional regen projects to nominate participants, creating a broader representation of contributors to the Regen movement. You can view the round nominations in this google sheet: [GG22 Regen Citizens Genesis Round Nominations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BxKJWaWgoOSyldCMGbnJv8yl9WnezX-DxgXS1kvwNFQ/edit?gid=242653894#gid=242653894).

## Key Results

* **Organic Donations Reflecting Community Engagement:** Round donations totalled $8,868 from 491 unique contributors, with an average donor supporting 5.88 participants,. This equated to 42% of the total matching pool and 71% of the matching funds provided by Gitcoin demonstrating strong community engagement and significantly exceeded the 20% Allo GMV requirement.

* **Matching Distribution**: Gitcoin Passport Model-Based Detection System was used to ensure fair and transparent distribution of the $21,000 matching pool. 100.00% of addresses were analyzed leading to 165 donors (33.6%) receiving full matching and 27 donors (5.5%) receiving partial matching.

* **Viaprize PayPal Integration**: This new feature brought 14 additional donations into the round.

## Key Reflections

* **Challenges with the Nominations Process**: While capping participants ensured meaningful fund distribution, the invite-only nominations process presented notable challenges. A high level of interest from individuals and projects placed significant pressure on round operators, making it difficult for participating organizations to manage the selection process effectively. Participating organizations found it challenging to balance the task of selecting a limited number of nominees while ensuring transparency, community consensus, and legitimacy. This highlighted the need for clearer criteria, more time prior to round activation, improved communication, and more inclusive processes in future rounds

* **Viaprize PayPal Integration**: The Viaprize PayPal integration resulted in only 14 additional donations, falling short of expectations and its potential impact. This outcome suggests a need for better communication and awareness among participants to encourage sharing and utilization of this option. Additionally, the use of a separate platform may have contributed to reduced engagement, highlighting the importance of seamless integration within the Gitcoin platform to maximize usability and participation in future rounds.

* **Community Engagement and Impact**: The Regen Citizens Genesis Round successfully celebrated and recognized the contributions of key individuals driving the regenerative movement. There was strong community engagement and widespread support for the initiative. The round not only highlighted the collective power of the Regen movement but also showcased the effectiveness of quadratic funding in distributing resources in alignment with community values. This success reinforces the importance of continuing to build and nurture this ecosystem in future rounds.

## Closing Thoughts & Memoriam

We are proud of the Regen Citizens Genesis Roundâ€™s success in celebrating the individuals who make the regenerative movement in web3 possible. While there are clear areas for improvement, we believe the round has made a significant start in fulfilling its purpose of recognizing, rewarding, and inspiring the Regen community. More to come!

This round would not have been possible without the tireless efforts of IZZY @decentralizedceo, who personally championed this initiative from the beginning. His leadership was instrumental in creating a round that truly embodied the spirit of regeneration and bring the core team of regens @MontyMerlin @MattyCompost @wasabi @Jimi @TheTokenJedi @LuukDAO onboard. Tragically, this round also coincided with the loss of IZZY. He was a cherished community member whose energy and dedication inspired us all. While his absence is deeply felt by his family and the Regen movement, we are committed to honoring his legacy in the spirit of regeneration that he embodied, possibly through future Regen Citizen Rounds.

IZZYâ€™s impact will live on and his legacy will never be forgotten. Rest In Power brother

            <p><strong>Fantastic retrospect.</strong></p>
<p>I know some had raised concerns about the viaprize PayPal integration, how it related to QF, and what role did COCM play in evaluating those contributions. Any insights would be appreciated.</p>

<p>I agree with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/donny_jerri">@Donny_Jerri</a> , feel really happy to see so many Regens get recognized and rewarded for their contributions, but most importantly for keeping the movement alive and inspiring many others to become a Regen too.</p>
<p>For more iterations on this program to recognize more and most different Regenâ€™s contributions around the world, is my best wish for the future <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/raised_hands.png?v=12" title=":raised_hands:" class="emoji" alt=":raised_hands:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
