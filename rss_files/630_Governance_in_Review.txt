Governance in Review
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/governance-in-review/10826
    I wanted to share some of my thoughts after S14 and really look at governance as an organic work of balance above everything else and how creating governance flows in a mindful and collaborative manner can evolve us to a new way of organizing. Naturally. 

"What they tell you is that DAOs are decentralized autonomous organizations. Groups of humans organizing around a specific purpose, coordinating via an agreed-upon set of engagement rules enforced on a blockchain and sharing economic resources and/or protocol rules in the quest to fulfil said purpose.

What they don‚Äôt tell you in the brochure is that humans organizing around a purpose, sharing resources and coordinating via an ever evolving agreed-upon set of rules is HARD. Just like a butterfly transforming from a fleshy, ground bound caterpillar, new forms of human organization take their time to evolve from the hairy situation we‚Äôve progressively calcified ourselves into.

The complexities of coordination, collaboration and co-creation are so multi-faceted, multi-layered and multi-coloured that they are as beautiful as they are infuriating. Evolving DAOs feels like building a house on quicksand. During an earthquake. In the rain. It's all about balance. It‚Äôs an extreme exercise in balance above everything else."

<p>totally agree with you, there is a cartoon in China which is</p>
