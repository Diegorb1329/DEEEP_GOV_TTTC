Proposal to adjust Code of Conduct WRT Airdrops
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-to-adjust-code-of-conduct-wrt-airdrops/8383
    Hi everyone,

## proposal

I'd like to propose adding the following section to the [Gitcoin Code of Conduct](https://support.gitcoin.co/kb/article/42-code-of-conduct/).

> *Airdrops may come, but you are not entitled to an Airdrop.*
> Over the course of time, Gitcoin Grants has become a significant pillar of the ecosystem - in which more & more projects are reliant for support.  Because Gitcoin Grants has had 1mm+ lifetime crowdfund contributions, it has become a source of [data](https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/blob/master/docs/API.md) about which projects the community values, and who in the ecosystem is supporting these projects.
>  Any Airdrops that come to Gitcoin contributors have been on a "don't expect it, but be thankful if it comes" social norm.     
> We expect that community contributors are informed about, and participating in, the process through which governance passes proposals.   We expect that community members are graceful in accepting airdrops, but are not acting entitled to them unless a governance proposal passes that specifically entitles them to an airdrop at a specific time. Any disrespectful, harassing, entitled, or trolling behaviour related to airdrops is against the code of conduct.  

## motivation 1

The motviation for this proposal is based partially out of [this post](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/02/round9.html) from Vitalik (the architect of Quadratic Funding), in which he outlines the following spectrum through which what types of motivations for contributing to grants are within the design target for QF instances:

 ![motivations|690x271](upload://mZr3xtcO0JgXTxSFA56UWpjD2Ae.png)

## motivation 2

The second motivation for this proposal comes from my experience in interacting in the public channels of the Gitcoin Discord, in which several members have confessed to me that they are there to receive airdrops.  And would not otherwise contribute to Gitcoin Grants.

In some cases, these conversations have become combative.  Conversations have become heated when contributors feel entitled to an airdrop on their timetable, without going through [the ratified Governance process](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-dao-governance-process-v1/7860) and the Gitcoin Stewards or Gitcoin team cannot deliver.

By formalizing this policy in the CoC will make it clear to these contributors that their efforts to contribute only to receive airdrops are not worth their time,

## TLDR

![5ks2cy|500x500](upload://kzZr48iXysiQ6tbFj084G1yfVb7.jpeg)

## feedback welcome

I welcome feedback from any community members in the GitcoinDAO.

            <p>disregarding an airdrop or grant however you want to call it is not an option. Maybe find a way to reward people how are contributing not only ‚Äúin for the tech‚Äù (airdrop hunting)</p>

            <p>The term airdrop in crypto by now has the implication of getting ‚Äòsomething for nothing‚Äô. Some tokens are sent unannounced to existing accounts, or you click through some form just in time, or having participated with the issuer‚Äôs systems in the past, you can claim some.</p>
<p>But no further actions or contributions are expected, hence the broad attraction, luring hoards of crypto noobs, hunting for any drops.  It‚Äôs a reasonable behavior in their situation and does not make them bad. They are simply not a part of the core OSS ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù, and unlikely to become such.</p>
<p>Is there any way to shed all use of the term ‚Äòairdrop‚Äô and stick to ‚Äògrant‚Äô, which is broadly understood and not so encumbered?</p>
<p>And generally to stay away from promotional techniques that are so actively used by the numerous sketchy projects out there.  There is already precedent of a token stealing scam, using a giveaway <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/112339/creative-attacker-steals-76000-in-rune-by-giving-out-free-tokens" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Creative attacker steals $76,000 in RUNE by giving out free tokens</a></p>

            <p>Just to say ‚Äòhere to receive airdrop otherwise will not join‚Äô is the first step of the funnel, as long as it is clear " <em>Airdrops may come, but you are not entitled to an Airdrop.</em>" as owocki suggests, rush in to receive airdrop itself is still overall positive‚Ä¶ these are curious people at least, they have the ability to adopt new things. It is not feasible nor desired AFAIC to ban airdrop.</p>
<p>If people feel they don‚Äôt belong to the culture, they will leave. I feel culture is more important than slogon to deter gitcoin-target-user-tobe</p>

            <p>I support this proposal!  Quell the greed.  Maybe airdrops should be stopped.  So many just dump the tokens immediately anyways‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Wow I can‚Äôt believe people have gotten combative.  That is crazy!  This kinda stuff is exactly why people involved with the grant reviews and prohibitions should use pseudonyms or protect themselves otherwise.</p>

            <p>Absolutely didn‚Äôt agree with u sir,what is called ‚Äúcontribution‚Äù in your words? only code ? think about the people who can not write code,they just wanna donate to contribute web3.0, so what they only can do is donate their money, As for airdrop, depends on the project team, if they would airdrop,then there‚Äôs a airdrop. if there‚Äôs not, there‚Äôs not! NO NEED PROPOSAL. but i agree with part of your word, the man donate just for airdrop,wanna be a Speculator. Definately we won‚Äôt welcome hr or she.whether he is a chino, americano,cubano,mexico,wherever he come from.</p>

            <p>you mis-read my message, I am saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If anyone is expecting airdrop without contribution, you‚Äôre not welcome in Gitcoin community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I didn‚Äôt say :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to you only those people who can contribute to Gitcoin Community <strong>will recieve airdrop</strong> and are welcomed I Gitcoin community.</p>

            <ol>
<li>
<p>Best to frame positively: Gitcoin DAO - Join to contribute, recognition by peers may include tokens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should not shame and reject someone outright, for having had certain thoughts, based on the common use of the term ‚Äúairdrop‚Äù. Call it grants throughout, give the prospects the rules and let  them decide whether to apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following economic incentives, within the confines of specific rules, like maximizing ROI [maximum return for minimum investment], cannot be framed as a negative, when the very security of the blockchain relies on combined economic interests of the [notable] majority of numerous independent participants.  If undesirable outcomes arise, adjust incentives and rules.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally, should remember that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Possession of tokens does not equate to the membership in the DAO.</li>
<li>One time grants for prior participation in other venues are different from [future, possibly ongoing] rewards for contributions to the DAO.</li>

            <p>Thank you so much for your kind response.</p>
<p>What I mean by damage is this. The original purpose of the Quadratic Funding idea was that the amount of matching funds given to a grant are proportional to the number of donations they receive (as opposed to matching based on the total dollars of donations they received). This is because QF is attempting to gauge true community sentiment for a project as a way to guide matching donors in their decision on who to match and how much. This works if the measure of ‚Äòtrue community sentiment‚Äô is accurate. When some projects (that is some grant recipients) promise something in return for donations, any project that doesn‚Äôt promise equally valuable returns will obviously suffer in the measurement of their popularity. This defeats the original intent of QF. For grants that have nothing to ‚Äòairdrop‚Äô, they simply can‚Äôt compete for attention, and what you end up with is not a matching system that rewards projects that of the most use to the community, but projects who pay their donors the highest reward.</p>
<p>Does that explain what I mean?</p>

<p>You can feel comfortable, don‚Äôt worry. When you make a donation, I think what is important is the idea behind or the intention of contributing, whatever the amount is. Of course, the more you can contribute the better is for the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Some people can contribute 1$, some people can contribute 100$, it‚Äôs more than fine!! And we thank you for your support!</p>

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/tjayrush">@tjayrush</a> to be honest, in my case, as a not native english person, sometimes i am missing the correct word. in these case the word airdrop (from gtc), maybe would be the word ‚Äúgiveaway‚Äù fit better?(in my case) anyhow. i think i catched you. i saw one project, and they said, they give an airdrop to their recipients and the donators from gc, but only if you donated more than $1. maybe these (or another amount) could be a solution for these projects? in my case, i was not expecting to get some airdrops from each specific project. for sure, nice to have, and a nice side effect is, feeling more connected to the project, in sense of community building a good step, imho. eg i see myself as some kind of supporter/investor on gc.</p>

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/sirlupinwatson">@Sirlupinwatson</a> thanks for your explaining. to be honest, i understand the concept of qf, but not the formula itself completely or the exact mechanism to distribute to each project. i saw Vitalik at the final and he said something about the amount of small donations and asked if it will be ‚Äúenough‚Äù for the projects?(not exactly words, in these direction) because of that, i am not so sure if it was a good idea, to split it in so many small donations, in my case. i am not sure anymore, if my idea, to support as many projects as possible was a good idea? to take all on the menu. next round i will change my behaviour probably. whats the best way to have the maximum impact to the gc projects?</p>

            <p>It feels as if there may be some combination of two topics here. One is airdrops of GTC from the Gitcoin governance process. A second issue is airdrops from grant recipients as re-payment or consideration for grants during the rounds.</p>
<p>I fully support the above text, and I understand the desire to leave open the option for future GTC airdrops, but I am very deeply against grant recipients giving airdrops to those who donate to their grants at any point.</p>
<p>For this reason, I might separate out the two cases. GTC airdrops are one thing. Airdrops to those who donate to a grant by the grant recipient should cause immediate removal of the grant from the website (after review of course). The amount of damage airdrops by grant recipients does to the whole process is massive.</p>
<p>The text above doesn‚Äôt make that clear and actually confuses (at least for me) whether or not it‚Äôs acceptable for grant recipients to give airdrops.</p>
<p>Accept my appologies if I‚Äôm missing something or misunderstanding.</p>

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/blockchaindude108">@blockchaindude108</a> Micro transaction are fine, for example I did contribute to 10 new grants because they did not received any funding yet and I think it‚Äôs a great way to motivate them in their projects or just a appreciable kick-off. If you decide to opt for a Grant Collection with multiple grant recipient, it‚Äôs more than fine to use a significantly lower amount because you are contributing to multiple grant.</p>
<p>The problem about micro transaction in this case is that there were a correlation between the time the ‚ÄúAirdrop‚Äù was made and the creation of a user account with some micro contribution transaction a few days after the ‚ÄúAirdrop‚Äù, and these user were commenting saying that they did not received anything‚Ä¶</p>

            <p>Hi Kevin, i see it in your way. Altruistic is the best way to donate. and thats also a part of my donations, the rest is more idealistic, because i am thinking its so important to change the world with these projects. i did also donations for some of my family members, because i was so excited when i told them about gitcoin, to support these project and a s.load of other projects. what it means to support open source, help devs to become independently,‚Ä¶ decentralize work, decentralize stress (i like your quote from the bankless interview.). and for one of my no-coiners (i will fix that in the future, directly when i have a time leftover), the motivation to spend some money was more related to the personal crisis related to covid. these person was maybe 50% altruistic. i described it in a way like a funder, who gets in anyway a win win situation. but i also said, there is no guarantee, because, hey man, its a donation, and a donation is nicer (or a donation is a donation‚Ä¶), if you do not to expect anything. but hey, gitcoin is an amazing project with nice ethics, and in the end, it seems that they take care of their people, and we will see. thats it. i had love to get more involved in some workstreams or other things, but i am still try to improve my skills (and get some time leftovers), so for me it was these way to support the community. became a supporter in these way. maybe also a way to decentralize stress? in my actual timeframe its the only way to support GC. btw, i made a s.load of small donations, because the influencers (i saw) said in their channels, its better to spend only $1 to their project than more. Maybe misinterpretation of qf? Maybe there needs some more information? i am not so sure if it was good to split my donations in so much small little pieces?</p>
<p>did i expect an ‚Äúairdrop‚Äù - no.<br>
would it be nice - for sure.</p>
<p>Some channels i saw before gr9 recommended GC because they got something back from gr8 donations. and i think, things like that made some expectations to the donations and a lot of people used it mainly for these reason and forgot the altruistic idea of donations? Should GC be altruistic with these persons? i trust in GC and his values to make a good decision.</p>

            <p>The Gitcoin team cannot and will not promise any airdrops. The initial GTC allocation was done to people who actively participated in the Gitcoin ecosystem and to bootstrap the process of decentralizing Gitcoin. People were funding public goods before any airdrops of any kind, and we‚Äôre confident they will continue to do so well into the future.</p>
<p>Gitcoin has a mission, and GTC has a purpose. No misinformation has been provided, there were not any lies. If any further GTC allocations/distributions are to occur, they must be approved by the DAO after going through the governance process.</p>

            <p>Joe must have misread the question.  Only GR10 GRANT OWNERS will receive GTC, per this proposal <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/QmY7yvzid9KM8Jn5MrAXe853wRmk5tjNSzW2DR82q8Z5RJ" class="inline-onebox">Snapshot</a></p>

            <p>Sorry to hurt you but sir this is truth. That is the only thing hurting users. If Gitcoin will tell people at once no airdrop and will never be in future. Instead of telling them these sentences hurt people a lot sir.<br>
BTW if you are Hurt I am sorry . You helped me with a tip and I appreciate it <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/heart.png?v=10" title=":heart:" class="emoji" alt=":heart:"><br>
Looking forward to serve Gitcoin Community but Admins should show postive approach instead of putting users in dilemma.</p>

            <p>Please, stay respectful on this forum.</p>
<p>If you want to speak publicly, do it with a convenient and civilized approach.</p>
<p>You are literally one of the user who did ask me some money‚Ä¶ And I did send you some‚Ä¶<br>
Why are you doing this now then?</p>
