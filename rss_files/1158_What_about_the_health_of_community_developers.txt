    Hi, I am interested to see what ideas exist on how we can help our community have better health! For example, someone that is on a chair for a lot of hours, or is on a screen all the time it is possible to have some health issues that may affect his productivity and in general, have a lower quality of life.

Do you think there is possible to create a health service for the gitcoin community that helps these people?
Is it possible to create a social security system that helps people with their health problems or provides financial support to them?

            <p>health is everyoneâ€™s responsibility. I think exercise and less food will help with this problem. movement is<br>
a life. everyone knows this, not only in the gitcoin community.</p>
