    The Gitcoin Citizens Round #2 just came to a close with [fantastic results](https://x.com/GitcoinCitizens/status/1717202295840989269?s=20). During our [final space](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1OyKAWwaOrOJb?s=20) @carlosjmelgar made the great suggestion to create a post under which Citizens can regularly update us on what they've been working on. 
This will allow the core team and Gitcoin Stewards to stay in the loop on all things Citizens, and inspire others to join the fun. 

[GG19 is coming up](http://grants.gitcoin.co) and we can't wait to see what Citizens will be doing. 

Note: In case you missed this Citizens are the bridge builders, educators, communicators, the unsung heroes who we want to reward more. You can read more on this [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/rewarding-the-community-gitcoin-citizens-round-2/16506). 

So without further ado, tell us Citizens, what have you been up to?

FractalVisions

            <p>A quick update here. After many challenges due to the plans to sunset the PGN network &amp; allo v2 update we have had to shift the schedule for our grants program from January until April. We will provide another update once the v2 contracts are available so we can deploy our round and begin the application over for our current round on Optimism network.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs unfortunate that PGN is shutting down.</p>

Gitcoin Citizens: What are you doing?
Jag

            <p>Hey Citizens fam, I‚Äôve been working on bringing more people Onchain to web3, starting broadly and then gradually narrowing focus towards Scientists &amp; Physicians. We‚Äôre a few episodes in (<a href="https://arch1med3sl3v3r.substack.com/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://arch1med3sl3v3r.substack.com/</a>). DeID and Gitcoin Passport are relatively risk-free onboarding tools (as opposed to DeFi), and Gitcoin a solid Schelling Point for well-meaning newcomers. In our view, it‚Äôs important for the uninitiated to learn about Gitcoin &amp; Public Goods - up there with primitives like BTC &amp; ETH.</p>
<p>Gitcoin is also a great signaling tool for projects/protocols that are under the radar and poised to create value, so we‚Äôre skating to where the puck is going by priming discussions towards innovations in Elastic DeFi like the AMPL-SPOT Protocol. Naturally, this entails broader discussions about web3 values.</p>
<p>The Gitcoin Citizens project has been incredibly valuable and supportive, and we‚Äôd like to help it grow. AMPL has been staked in the Rollover Vault on the citizensofgitcoin.eth domain to help <em><strong>secure</strong></em> Inflation-Resistant Flatcoin SPOT. <strong>In our humble opinion, a Liquidation-Free stable asset like SPOT that doesn‚Äôt lose Purchasing Power is Public Good</strong>. As the Ampleforth protocol expands and value accrues in the vault, we hope Gitcoin Citizens will learn about the system and govern how the value should be directed towards Public Goods (<em>very loosely, DAI is to ETH as SPOT is to AMPL</em>).</p>

<p>Importantly, our focus is not on exclusively shilling protocols. We are also interested in raising awareness about engineering &amp; design principles from Elastic Decentralized Finance. We believe the inversion of Price Elasticity into Supply Elasticity will be seen as a vital step for DAOs interested in securing their treasuries. After all, this is biomimicry.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs also some other content that we‚Äôve been making round to round on our YouTube channel‚Ä¶! It‚Äôs tough to keep up with everything, but we are trying our best to keep people informed. Spreading awareness about public goods and the gitcoin ecosystem is definitely an ongoing job. There are lots of aspects of the website that have been changing and evolving along the way to keep people updated on.</p>

            <p>Few updates on GrantsScope (AI utilities to help in grantee discovery):</p>
<ul>
<li>As promised in this <a href="https://x.com/RohitMalekar/status/1715017897461035228?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">meme</a>, got a domain for the project, <a href="https://grantsscope.xyz/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://grantsscope.xyz/</a> and consolidated all the apps here.</li>
<li>Built a few custom GPTs using Open AI‚Äôs recent development from earlier in the week to assess if they would be a viable alternative to building chatbots from scratch - users of the GPTs requiring a Plus subscription to use the tools is a deal breaker.</li>
<li>So then, back to basics - I am working on the data plumbing to set up GrantsScope for GG19.</li>
<li>Also rabbit-holing into applying clustering algorithms on problem descriptions and solutions grantees are working on. Donors can choose where to concentrate or diversify their contributions if we can help visualize this in a 2D or 3D space. This might work even worse than how I am describing but too tempting not to try it out!</li>

<p>Have been devouring everything Ethereum since one of the first meet-ups in London at the Barclays Elevator space which included a presentation by Chief Ethereum Scientist Mr Vitalik.

This will allow the core team and Gitcoin Stewards to stay in the loop on all things Citizens, and inspire others to join the fun.</p>
<p><a href="http://grants.gitcoin.co">GG19 is coming up</a> and we can‚Äôt wait to see what Citizens will be doing.</p>
<p>Note: In case you missed this Citizens are the bridge builders, educators, communicators, the unsung heroes who we want to reward more. You can read more on this <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/rewarding-the-community-gitcoin-citizens-round-2/16506">here</a>.</p>
