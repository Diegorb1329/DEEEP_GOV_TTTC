https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-building-gitcoin-round-now-open-for-gr10/6873
    Hey everyone, now that this proposal ( https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gr10-matching-pool-use-gitcoin-to-build-gitcoindao/6372) to build Gitcoin using Gitcoin Grants has passed, you can now open up a new grant at https://gitcoin.co/grants/new within the "Building Gitcoin" category on the site.
 
Grants in this category will be automatically considered for the $50k matching pool allocated to this category.

If you are building something in the Gitcoin ecosystem, its worth hitting https://gitcoin.co/grants/new and creating a grant so people can support you!

What is in scope per the proposal:
1. anything involved in the DAO workstreams
  1. governance for the public good
  2. prototypes for the public good
  3. decentralization of Gitcoin itself
  4. anti-fraud
2. communication - creating content or memes for the public good
3. in general - anyone who is advancing GitcoinDAO‚Äôs goals/mission through their actions.
