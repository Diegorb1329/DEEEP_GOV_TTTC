Citizen Grants GCP - Creation of Educational Content in Spanish for Gitcoin
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/citizen-grants-gcp-creation-of-educational-content-in-spanish-for-gitcoin/20128
    ### Proposal Title:

Creating Educational Content and Growing Community for the Gitcoin Ecosystem in Spanish

### Proposal Description:

This proposal aims to develop high-quality educational content to increase awareness, engagement, and participation in the Gitcoin ecosystem among the Spanish-speaking community. Through tutorial videos, expert interviews, newsletters, and social media content, we will provide accessible resources to help users navigate Gitcoin's tools, funding mechanisms, and its mission in public goods funding.

### Interested Parties and Expected Impact:

* Gitcoin Community and Developers: Increased adoption and usage of Gitcoin grants, quadratic funding, and decentralized governance tools.
* Spanish-Speaking Audience: Greater understanding of the Gitcoin ecosystem, leading to increased participation in funding rounds and governance.
* Gitcoin Network Effect: A more educated user base contributing to Gitcoin's mission and strengthening the decentralized funding movement.
* Gitcoin Community Support: Telegram users such as @MathildaDV and @wasabinetwork support this proposal, even offering to participate in the podcasts.

### Motivation:

Gitcoin is revolutionizing public goods funding through quadratic funding and open-source development, but Spanish-speaking users lack structured educational content to fully understand and participate in the ecosystem. By creating high-impact content, we aim to:

* Educate users about Gitcoin grants, funding processes, and governance.
* Encourage adoption by breaking down complex concepts into easy-to-understand content.
* Expand the Gitcoin ecosystem in Latin America and Spain by fostering a committed community.

I have no conflicts of interest in this proposal. The Gitcoin Citizen Grants Program should adopt this proposal because education is key to scaling Gitcoin‚Äôs mission globally. Without clear, structured educational materials, many developers and potential contributors may not fully understand how to leverage Gitcoin‚Äôs tools.

* Long-term impact, as the content will remain available for continuous education and onboarding.

### Funding Request:

USD 30,000 in USDT

---

### Challenges and Limitations:

* Measuring direct conversions: While we will track engagement, connecting content directly to Gitcoin‚Äôs KPIs (e.g., funding participation) may require additional collaboration with Gitcoin‚Äôs analytics team.

|Short-form Social Media Content (17 Videos)|$7,300|
|Educational Newsletters (3 Editions)|$1,500|
|Total:|$30,000 in USDT|

---

### Success Measures and KPIs:

* Engagement Metrics: Total video views, likes, and comments on YouTube.
* Community Growth: Increase in participation in Spanish-language Gitcoin Telegram and Twitter.
* Adoption Rate: Number of new users engaging with Gitcoin grants after interacting with the content.
* Governance Participation: Growth in Spanish-speaking voters in Gitcoin discussions.
* Impact Reports: Assessment based on metrics regarding Gitcoin ecosystem growth.

### Non-Financial Requirements:

To ensure success, we request:

* Official collaboration with the Gitcoin team for access to experts and resources.
* Support through Gitcoin community channels (Twitter, Discord, Newsletter) where possible.
* Inclusion in Gitcoin‚Äôs educational hub to maximize reach.

This proposal aligns with Gitcoin‚Äôs mission to fund public goods and expand the decentralized ecosystem by providing accessible, engaging, and high-quality education for the Spanish-speaking community.

            <p>Appreciate the effort and thoughtfulness put into this proposal! I agree that educational content without a clear tie to revenue/GMV goals is not a priority at this time, and will be voting no.</p>

            <p>since spanish speaking educational content is not a priority for gitcoin at this time, i will be voting against this proposal.</p>
<p>there might be ethereum localist rounds in gg23 within spanish speaking areas of the world, and i‚Äôd be open to see them produce content for their communities‚Ä¶ but the budget for translation should not be more than 5% of the round size imo.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, I merely directed you to the GCP process. I will need to read it in depth before I can make a decision on whether I support it or not, and I didn‚Äôt offer to participate in your podcast.</p>
<p>Reading the proposal, although I believe there is value in gaining traction in Spanish-speaking communities, there‚Äôs a general lack of direct success metrics outlining the value that this content will yield for Gitcoin. The budget you‚Äôre requesting is pretty substantial, and your proposal does not include any specifics on the content you‚Äôll be creating (only the medium/format), who exactly you‚Äôll be reaching and what problem it‚Äôs specifically solving for and how it‚Äôs aligned with Gitcoin‚Äôs wider goals.</p>
<p>The final decision lies with our internal grants council, but as a steward, my vote on this will be a no.</p>
