    As a strategic policy advisor at the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with a background in IT, public procurement and law (LLM in commercial law) I‚Äôd be most interested in contributing to creating policy regarding what is/is not an acceptable grant and building a framework for a fair dispute resolution process for grants.

Can anybody share the specifics on how to contribute?
