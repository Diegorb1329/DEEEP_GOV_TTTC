# 3/30 DAO Vibezzz

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oawQVzl9KQA

### What parts of your life that donâ€™t seem *directly* related to web3 keep popping up in web3 communities?

- Loie stayed in a Hacker House in Barcelona and met an activist who was from a very small activist community near her hometown. She found different elements of herself are reflected within Web3.
- Colton sees a lot of overlaps with web3 and mindfulness/meditation. This topic often comes up in his circles. He also was in Andrew Yangâ€™s political campaign before being in Web3 and then felt amazing to see Andrew Yang on stage in Denver and knowing people that were so integral to his campaign were now in Web3
    - Andrew Yangâ€™s talk at EthDenver: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzuwqGzk7F8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzuwqGzk7F8)
- Ben West: He sees web3 values in the street art community (who are very influential in NFTs) and lots of artist overlap
- Owocki: Since reading [meditations on moloch](https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/Meditations-On-Moloch), he is seeing coordination failures everywhere in life (seeing web3 things outside of web3) like when he and his wife forget to communicate and run out of milk for the kids. Also hears Web3 vocab everywhere too. Got â€˜ruggedâ€™ by his nanny not showing up
- Umar: Seeing â€˜individualâ€™ vs â€˜collectivistâ€™ in his parents. His dad is a former athlete, team player, collectivist. His mom is an individualist, who likes things her way
- [Schelling points come up everywhere and Owockiâ€™s marketing Strat is to make it known](https://twitter.com/schellingpoint_)
- Gaming, Mythology, and Web3 have a lot of overlap and reflections: Soulbound NFTs, Raid Guild. This space has a lot of gamification of life
- DeFi app feels like something between trading, gaming, and working
- Armando: Everyone in Web3 starts with a positive attitude towards others. Outside of web2, distrust may be the default but inside web3 trust is
- David DYOR: In his country, one of the major fed political parties is basing his platform on crypto. Itâ€™s coming from the right. On the other side, the current leader has been seizing bank accounts and crypto accounts for being linked to donations to trucker protest
- Loie: Rejecting bipartisan systems is more reflected in Web3 than outside. Crypto gets supported by people on both sides of the aisle, and denies the duality system
- Lack of coordination tools in the past may have prevented people from finding a middle ground
- Gloria: Andrew Yang said we need solution providers. Web3 is all about seeing a problem and finding a new solution to it. Itâ€™s okay to step away from the duality system and just think about how we can solve problems
- Umar: Andrew Yangâ€™s new â€˜Forward Partyâ€™ has a lot of promise. Crypto takes right-wing libertarian values and left-wing welfare values and tries to make them compatible. Will be interesting to see how the Forward Party approaches this

### What is public and what is private in terms of social support offered to DAO contributors? (as in govt vs corporate, not open vs secret)

- In times of hardship (becoming a parent, medical emergencies, etc): financial, social, political support is so important to have.
- People often find support from their employers in the U.S where in other western countries (Canada, Europe) the government will offer more support/funding in times of hardship
- Ethereum is kind of a nation of its own and could be considered a governing body. Whose responsibility is it to provide social support systems? Individual DAOs, the ecosystem, outside bodies?
- Kevin Olsen: Communities could do this on the local level. Like within Gitcoin. There could also be unions for practice (like software engineers) which support each other. There needs to be trust for this to work
- Owocki: Thereâ€™s a meme that Ethereum is a Dark Forest. Itâ€™s only a dark forest because you donâ€™t know who is around you â€” when you canâ€™t identify people then everyone is a potential adversary. When you start crossing smart contracts with decentralized identity then you can see what people have done on the blockchain and recognize them for their actions â€” shining a light on the people around you.
    - Check out the Metadreamer podcast on this topic: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqeeZwQr7TQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqeeZwQr7TQ)
- Loie: What about not just people but entities, projects that exert influence over our lives?
- Theory of the firm: entities should dissipate into nothing once they are no longer needed
- Modular software design practices allow for plug-and-play infrastructure for communities. True Interoperability
- Need to be comfortable striding towards things that are not just short-term gains: education, healthcare, clean water. We should use composability for more than making money.
- Web3 is the great unlearning. You have to be comfortable unlearning what youâ€™re accustomed or made to believe. Money is just a unit of measurement â€” itâ€™s like stacking takeout menus but that doesnâ€™t make you full. Money is like saving inches.
- Moloch is inside all of us. We have imperfections and we need to block them with new programs. Encode our values into our money
- When you travel to new counties, you realize there are other systems of life. When deciding to fund a social system. Having a child is hard and only getting 6 weeks off to raise a newborn is incredibly hard. In Netherlands, they have 2 years. Need to compare systems and challenge ourselves to think of new systems or analyze more existing ones.
- If we need to disprove why something existing is the best way to do it then we get stuck. How do we make sure we donâ€™t get stuck in coordination processes as we make new governing models? We know existing bureaucracy takes forever
- We try and fail â€” we try to be fluid. We be honest about things working or not working. Open and honest to failure, instead of fearing it. Pondering too long could make the problem change to where a deeply-thought solution no longer works.
- Applying software practices to other areas of life
- Gloria: Parenting using Agile
    - If you think youâ€™re going to parent one way youâ€™ll probably fail. Adapt and see what works
    - Onboard Gloriaâ€™s son to gitcoin!!
    - [https://www.ted.com/talks/bruce_feiler_agile_programming_for_your_family](https://www.ted.com/talks/bruce_feiler_agile_programming_for_your_family)
- The way in to Web3/DAOâ€™s may not be through money. Association to cryptocurrency is less appealing to many than lore, social empowerment. Sovereignty over wealth
- The Economy is something lots of kids/teenagers donâ€™t like. Money is a social construct. Values within a family are so much more collective than economic ones

### Is Pizza a Public Good? PizzaDAO Grant is being discussed at FDD

- Pizza is Finite,  Excludable and Rivalrous
- Begs the question: Should Gitcoin be determining if something is a public good or leave it to the community to determine?
- A nuanced view of public goods: most things arenâ€™t pure public or private goods. There are double-sided marketplaces. Like Ethereum: anyone can read, but itâ€™s pay to write. Reading is a public good but writing is a private good.
- PizzaDAO has received lots of community support and Gitcoin should leave it to the community to decide what receives quadratic funding
- [https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/https-gitcoin-co-grants-5427-global-pizza-party-w-pizzadao-80e7ff40f42e4913815cec9b43fc6113](https://www.notion.so/https-gitcoin-co-grants-5427-global-pizza-party-w-pizzadao-80e7ff40f42e4913815cec9b43fc6113)
- In discussing privacy coins:
    - Privacy favors the individual. Transparency favors the collective.
