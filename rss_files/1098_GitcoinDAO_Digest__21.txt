### üå±[Public Goods Funding](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Public-Goods-Funding-80a3202a3a244c65b3fda08c0f7c7d60)

* [Annika](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/annika) has been ramping up as a grants-ops lead. She published a proposal for [Gitcoin GR12 Matching Pool Allocations](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gitcoin-gr12-matching-pool-allocations/9007) to ‚Äúdiscuss and finalize how funding allocations for the Gitcoin Grants Round 12 Matching Pool are distributed‚Äù. The proposal is currently live on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0x2ccad330b1d12a8fd0c00835bf8cf2b84a2f51ff187bca36c37fddfab3ca47ab).

The event aims to help push the mission of public goods to a broader audience.

### [üöÄ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-prototyping-workstream-moonshot-budget-request-q4-2021/8785) [Moonshot Collective](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Moonshot-Collective-ffa78f44a0de412cb607f9b69d3a376f)

* [The GreatestLARP](https://greatestlarp.com/) continues! Help coordinate to stop Moloch while raising funds for public goods. We are mid Level 3, with 144 of 200 Molochs needed to open Level 4 minted. Wanna play? We expect to reach 200 Molochs minted sometime within the week, which will unlock The Final Boss. The GreatestLARP has already raised over $338,000 for public goods.

* This week we launched our new blog. If you‚Äôd like to learn more about Moonshot Collective, check out our [‚ÄòHello World‚Äô post here](https://medium.com/moonshot-collective/hello-world-were-moonshot-collective-b17b3d5139fe).

* This week we dogfooded Season 1 priorities Recruiter.Party, and Retroactive Public Goods Funding Starter Kit (Payback). Check out our demo videos on the Moonshot Collective [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfbOba7iD19HyrB9QbV6Uww).

### üåê [Decentralize Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Decentralize-Gitcoin-c3197f918bf640bc9809cd26d56c93f3)

* Performance fixes have been implemented in the dGrants platform around blockchain data retrieval, indexed data retrieval from The Graph, and IPFS data retrieval resulting in a much more snappy feeling when browsing grants on dGrants.

* The GrantRound contract that will be used for GR12 has been finalized and deployed.

* We have added a few new features like a My Grants page and My Contributions page which will help give insight into your own actions on the platform.

* We are finalizing the list of eligible grants that will be a part of the ‚ÄòGitcoin Building‚Äô Grant Round in GR12.

* Migrating the Anti Sybil pipeline infrastructure and code from Bloc Science to the Gitcoin DAO is underway and making progress.

* The DevOps sub-stream is beginning a discovery phase intended to learn what additions would have the highest immediate impact on the DAO based on needs across the board.


### üíô [Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Fraud-Detection-Defense-f1a2969a9f324f57a02ef69a60b25cae)

* Contributor payments for Epochs 1 & 2 have been paid using Gilden mass pay. Contributors receive an email notification with the transaction hash; with a gas cost of about $250 for the entire workstream we‚Äôre able to cover each biweekly payment.

* Anti-Sybil ML:
  * Changing the name to Sybil Detection. This week Blockscience is delivering a refactored code while the ASOP were set up by the new DAO DevOps lead.
  * The feature engineering squad identified new patterns from Github data and is developing processes and access policies to make it easier for new contributors to participate.
  * Onchain Forensics work starts this week having accepted Trueblocks to help guide how we use onchain data to not only identify sybil behavior, but also to educate Gitcoin users about the transparency of their on-chain activities.
* Research:
  * Added 2 squads this week.
  * Risks & Threats will be studying sybil attacks and other threats to the grants mechanism. They will identify other threats and risks to the DAO as well. These learnings will be used to draft proposals to dive deeper into mitigation techniques.
  * Growth & Experimentation will be looking at stream & squad governance and compensation policies working within GitcoinDAO to define and conduct experiments teaching us how to grow.
* Policy:
  * The GitcoinDAO Appeals Panel now has over 10 members to hear out any appeals to decisions made by the FDD Grant Approvals and Disputes squads. The panel consists of industry experts from projects like BrightID, Idena, and 1Hive and are chosen for their expertise in identifying sybil behavior.
* DAOops is spinning out of FDD as planned on the Q4 budget proposal. FDD is ready to send the funds to the multisig for DAOops providing a clean transition of responsibility and accountability. Gitcoin Holdings is working on a governance proposal to formalize a DAOops workstream consisting of:
  * CrossDAO Operations - Opt-in shared infrastructure services governed by the CrossStream DAOops Governance council with reps from each workstream, DAOops, and Gitcoin Holdings. The squads include Onboarding Hosts, DAO Tooling, and People Operations.

  * DAOServices - Conducts business for the DAO as a whole like legal and accounting work. Looking to be more clearly defined in the proposal being drafted to be ratified by the stewards.

  * Support offering contributor support, user support, steward support etc. The current User Support stream also hosts the knowledge base, knowledge acquisition incentives and translations & localization efforts.

### üé® [Merch, Memes & Marketing](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Memes-Merch-Marketing-c1bd89fac8ab4569bf2a676df28025d8)

A couple of the designers from the bounty have been onboarded to the workstream and are continuing the work on the schwag pack for ETHDenver.

* The first version of the Meme Museum is planned to launch during the next Memepalooza which will take place next Friday, Dec 3. Preparations for the event are also ongoing.

<li>
<p>Contributor payments for Epochs 1 &amp; 2 have been paid using Gilden mass pay. Contributors receive an email notification with the transaction hash; with a gas cost of about $250 for the entire workstream we‚Äôre able to cover each biweekly payment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anti-Sybil ML:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing the name to Sybil Detection. This week Blockscience is delivering a refactored code while the ASOP were set up by the new DAO DevOps lead.</li>
<li>The feature engineering squad identified new patterns from Github data and is developing processes and access policies to make it easier for new contributors to participate.</li>
<li>Onchain Forensics work starts this week having accepted Trueblocks to help guide how we use onchain data to not only identify sybil behavior, but also to educate Gitcoin users about the transparency of their on-chain activities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added 2 squads this week.</li>
<li>Risks &amp; Threats will be studying sybil attacks and other threats to the grants mechanism. They will identify other threats and risks to the DAO as well. These learnings will be used to draft proposals to dive deeper into mitigation techniques.</li>
<li>Growth &amp; Experimentation will be looking at stream &amp; squad governance and compensation policies working within GitcoinDAO to define and conduct experiments teaching us how to grow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>The GitcoinDAO Appeals Panel now has over 10 members to hear out any appeals to decisions made by the FDD Grant Approvals and Disputes squads. The panel consists of industry experts from projects like BrightID, Idena, and 1Hive and are chosen for their expertise in identifying sybil behavior.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>DAOops is spinning out of FDD as planned on the Q4 budget proposal. FDD is ready to send the funds to the multisig for DAOops providing a clean transition of responsibility and accountability. Gitcoin Holdings is working on a governance proposal to formalize a DAOops workstream consisting of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CrossDAO Operations - Opt-in shared infrastructure services governed by the CrossStream DAOops Governance council with reps from each workstream, DAOops, and Gitcoin Holdings. The squads include Onboarding Hosts, DAO Tooling, and People Operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DAOServices - Conducts business for the DAO as a whole like legal and accounting work. Looking to be more clearly defined in the proposal being drafted to be ratified by the stewards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support offering contributor support, user support, steward support etc. The current User Support stream also hosts the knowledge base, knowledge acquisition incentives and translations &amp; localization efforts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
