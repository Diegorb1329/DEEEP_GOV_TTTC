https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/dao-compensation-sustainability/10604
    [GitcoinDAO has different starting conditions than most other DAOs](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoindao-starting-conditions-are-different-than-other-daos/10603).  

One effect of that is traditionally, people working at the Holdings company (corporate) have made salaries/benefits - like any corporation.  Gitcoin Holdings (the company that existed when the DAO originated) had a policy of paying team members US competitive market-rate-for-technology-companies-salaries, which in some cases, meant that often times our compensation policy meant offers were generated at compensation levels comparable [to this](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=software%20engineer&l=New%20York%2C%20NY&vjk=ed0910e8232509f7):

![Screen Shot 2022-05-14 at 12.33.53 PM|690x304, 40%](upload://hq1WngJHwfJDYKGjrLEk8Edbszh.png)

Of course, Gitcoin Holdings has venture funding & a business model (and revenue generated from doing virtual hackathons) that has allowed the corporation to generate offers in this category.  And even so, it is losing lots of money every month as it supports Gitcoin Grants (so perhaps this is not sustainable).

The DAO does not, as far as I know, have a model for financial sustainability yet. 

But it does seem that the DAO has inherited the company's compensation policies in some areas.

I am writing this post because I see this trend is about to collide with market conditions. I want to name that.  By naming this trend, the DAO can get ahead of it.

I believe that this sentiment is echoed in other stewards posts during S14 governance:

[quote="lefterisjp, post:1, topic:10585"]
I am running a company building opensource software in Berlin, Germany. We have a very constrained budget, yet we build amazing software. We are 7 people and we burn less in a year than some workstream budgets have asked for a quarter. I don‚Äôt know if they all expect ‚Äúsillicon valley‚Äù salaries but considering the market conditions I feel a strong urge to say no to all this spending.
[/quote]

Lefteris has told me privately that full time contributors to Rotki make $30k - $50k per year.

[quote="griff, post:1, topic:10594"]
For me the funding requests in general were just too much‚Ä¶ way too much. I come from the perspective of Giveth, Commons Stack and Token Engineering Commons and most of these proposals are asking more than their yearly budgets!
[/quote]

Griff has told me privately that Giveth contributors make $19/hour.   GivETH v2 shipped with about $500k in funding.

By way of comparison, Gitcoin Holdings pays roughly $300k/mo for software engineering.  And the DAO spends about $150k/mo on Moonshot Collective (the only software engineering organization natively in the DAO). 

Gitcoin has still not shipped Grants 2.0.  [Here are some more thoughts on why](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-overton-window-for-grants-2-0/10461).

# Open Questions

This leads me to a few questions I think the DAO should consider?

0. If I were to start this project all over again, should I have gone the Giveth/Rotki route?
0. Is the DAO in for more hard times if it continues Holdings' compensation patterns?  
2. Should GitcoinDAO pay six-figure salaries to its full time contributors, like the Holdings company did (perhaps unsustainably)?  
1. Is there a DAO-wide compensation policy in the works?  Should this policy be consistent in both times of [abundance & scarcity](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/abundance-scarcity/10045)?
2. Can the DAO sustain these compensation policies if [we are no longer the market leader](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-overton-window-for-grants-2-0/10461)?
3. What is the DAOs compensation model?  What are the workstreams compensation models?
5. What would have to be true for the DAO to create great software, become a market leader, get to financial sustainability, and pay web2-competitive salaries (the virtuous cycle I personally think the DAO should be aiming)?

I understand that these may be painful conversations to have.  But I see no alternative to getting these hard governance questions out in the open.

As always, please remember [I am just one node in the DAO network](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-dao-has-no-ceo/9852) - and I have perspective given how long I've been in the project, but the governance of this question (and other matters of import to the DAO) are up the [governance process](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-dao-governance-process-v3/10358).

            <p>Thank you Kris - there‚Äôs been so much talk on this the last couple weeks but I do want to give it the grace of responding on the forum where everyone can benefit from it! So:<br>
This!<img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/arrow_heading_down.png?v=12" title=":arrow_heading_down:" class="emoji" alt=":arrow_heading_down:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although I know it is just a ‚Äòconversation starter‚Äô, it is within the domain of people ops to provide some guidance here and I hope some more options can come up to equalize pay first before we eg go for a dao-wide reduction</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best path forward I see here is a custom competency/skill leveling framework. It is a matrix that looks like this:<br>
</p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/f/fe55b1ea377f2456b3b765d5f4df0a04630cd2d2.png" data-download-href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/fe55b1ea377f2456b3b765d5f4df0a04630cd2d2" title="Screen Shot 2022-06-10 at 5.37.52 PM"><img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/f/fe55b1ea377f2456b3b765d5f4df0a04630cd2d2_2_690x338.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-06-10 at 5.37.52 PM" data-base62-sha1="AhWSrzSaq4K3XDR6MIqSksEhlFo" width="690" height="338" srcset="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/f/fe55b1ea377f2456b3b765d5f4df0a04630cd2d2_2_690x338.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/f/fe55b1ea377f2456b3b765d5f4df0a04630cd2d2_2_1035x507.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/f/fe55b1ea377f2456b3b765d5f4df0a04630cd2d2_2_1380x676.png 2x" data-dominant-color="ECECEC"></a></div><br>
But ours would be tailored to match the competency that is most important in web3 and Gitcoin specifically. Typically an org uses this matrix to determine a salary offer <em>before</em> a hire is brought on. But in the instance where our pay is not equal thus far, I think using our same scoring mechanism that we use for new hires would be the most legitimate way to evaluate current contributors as well.<p></p>

<p>This is something Workstream leads have asked for from the stewards. More specifically, ‚ÄúWe want to know what the DAO budget is, and then we can determine how to spend those funds amongst us‚Äù</p>
<p>We are starting to explore a few options to help remove ambiguity here. Something like a sliding scale of compensation make-up (ie, what % is in stables and what % is in GTC) based on GTC price.</p>
<p>And then also taking a look at treasury sustainability, to ensure that we have (ideally) 10+ years of runway. This may not be possible with the current market, but we are planning to be a project and DAO that stands the test of time.</p>

</aside>
<p>Just want to note the optional 5% fee goes directly back into the matching pool for future rounds, no revenue for Holdings or the DAO. This changed about a year or so ago, before that the option did go to funding the Gitcoin core dev team (pre-dao).</p>

</aside>
<p>This was a change more than a year ago (nearly 2 years ago). We instead created a grant to fund the core development. It too has now been made inactive and we have no inflows to supplement development. This is something we have started to evaluate if we should change.

Measuring of people‚Äôs performance is not easy but this discussion shows how important it is to at least establish some standards (urgently) we can adopt dao-wide, and we‚Äôve been talking about this for a long time.</p>
<p>Salaries are pretty random from my view and in a bear market tensions around this will probably only rise. I‚Äôve seen private and public discussions around what some people make and I‚Äôve seen other workstreams being very good at hiding how much some people actually make.

<p>To be fully transparent here: future and further compensation will be negotiated here for all your awesome work, and you consult on multiple workstreams so your case is actually an example on why it is important to keep on refining this clause, there‚Äôs always so much context. Very happy that a first paragraph on this made it into v3 now though.</p>
<p>And yes, one steward cannot turn the vote but ofc they do influence others. Having power spread out over more non-contributing stewards would be a good thing, but then we ofc also need to work on how to incentivize them.</p>

            <p>My take (as a a steward), I should not be voting on the DAO Ops budget (I think I might have <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/thinking.png?v=12" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> ) but I am fine to vote on all other budgets. The DAO Ops budget does compensate me (as a contributor I currently make 1850 GTC a month), but no other workstream compensates me.</p>
<p>The conflict of interest clause is one we should remind stewards of, as I think most WS leads are also stewards with a fair amount of GTC delegated to them.</p>
<p>IMO, no one steward has the ability to approve or deny a budget on their own though. It usually takes three of more (at a minimum) to really move the vote (if they went against all other stewards/community members).</p>

<p>I‚Äôm strongly supportive of having a smaller group that creates a safe &amp; productive container for this conversation.

<p>saw this on twitter today + felt it was an interesting analogue for another DAO at scale.  (though MakerDAO isnt exactly comparable to Gitcoin in many ways - they are DEFI, Gitcoin is public goods.  they have a more sustainable financial model than Gitcoin does.  and they are a few years older than Gitcoin.). but i still find it compelling because it helps me think of what gitcoin would look like at scale.</p>

            <p>I‚Äôm not a voting member, but very interested in how the DAO responds to this question. I am grateful to <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a> for raising a challenging but necessary topic of conversation.</p>
<p>Reading through the governance process documents, it describes a policy for managing conflict of interest that seems to apply to any employee of the DAO who also holds governance tokens when addressing compensation questions:</p>

<blockquote>
<h4>Conflicts of Interest</h4>
<p>In any case where a steward or community member votes on a proposal that directly benefits themselves (e.g. voting to pass their own workstream budget) the vote will be considered invalid by default. Any steward may raise a claim of conflict to be addressed prior to a vote being finalized on Tally.</p>
<p>If a conflict is found, any related vote must be redone and may be considered passed so long as the steward in conflict abstains and the quorum rules are met.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This raises a practical question: How many Stewards are also employees of the DAO? Are there enough Stewards who don‚Äôt have a conflict of interest on this question to be able to reach quorum?</p>

            <p>I think charging the ecosystem rounds with a fee with operational/management and possible grant curation services is a great idea!</p>

</aside>
<p>Exactly, makes sense to charge them.</p>
<p>We have the same vision for the GIA, we want to become a Ecosystem/Cause grant curation service provider.(Hopefully we will have permissionless services when Grants 2.0 kick in).</p>
<p>For the Cause rounds we could do it pro bono, if the cause it altruistic in nature.</p>
<p>I believe It would be a natural move to try to generate some revenue especially seeing the growing number of ecosystems. We could also be kinda overwhelmed by  that growing number in the near future. <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p>On the topic of revenue - I do think there is an option in the near future to start charging operational/management fees for the growing number of Ecosystem rounds we are running.</p>
<p>Most of my time over the past few years at Gitcoin Holdings was focused on managing the virtual events/hackathons business, which did bring in a good amount of revenue via sponsorship fees. I‚Äôve now transitioned to focus pretty much fully on Grants, specifically ecosystem rounds, and I am moving from Holdings to the PGF workstream.</p>
<p>A lot of work goes into managing ecosystem rounds (not unlike hackathons) with partner/grantee onboarding, education, operations, marketing, payments, etc. We‚Äôve never charged fees for matching pool donors in the past because we obviously want 100% to go to the community, and funders are not really purchasing a service they are making a generous (charitable) donation.</p>
<p>But I think it‚Äôs a bit different for ecosystem rounds - while main pool and cause round donors likely don‚Äôt see any direct immediate benefits (besides exposure + goodwill), ecosystem round sponsors are specifically funding the growth and development of their own protocol or community (and not necessarily open source/public goods broadly).</p>
<p>Something I‚Äôve been thinking about as we move towards Grants 2.0 with more self serve features - ideally, anyone can run their own self serve QF round at any time they want, while Gitcoin will still host our big main rounds, with more hands on management for specific ecosystems or causes. It won‚Äôt be possible for PGF to scale and run all rounds, but if your option is to do all the work yourself or have Gitcoin manage it for free, many will opt for the latter. So I think eventually some type of fee or cost to cover DAO overhead for managed ecosystem rounds will be inevitable.</p>
<p>The important thing to weigh is the value of some additional revenue in the near term (and maybe it only makes a small dent in burn) versus the risk of slowing down growth and adoption. Personally, I think given the market pressures we‚Äôve seen as of late, it might make sense to begin generating some DAO revenue sooner rather than later. But I don‚Äôt think everyone agrees yet, curious what others think.</p>

<p>Just want to note the optional 5% fee goes directly back into the matching pool for future rounds, no revenue for Holdings or the DAO. This changed about a year or so ago, before that the option did go to funding the Gitcoin core dev team (pre-dao).</p>

<p>Then you need to work on your hiring process. It‚Äôs very easy.

<p>Paying $80k for a good senior sounds good. Also for Europe. But if budget is tight (like it is with rotki) can be accomplished with less. The most important thing to find is people aligned with the vision of what it is you are building and try to pay them as good as your budget allows.</p>
<p>The reason salaries and prices are mentioned is because this DAO is overspending and burning money like there is no tomorrow while there is zero revenue coming back in and ‚Ä¶ well let‚Äôs be honest. It has shipped very little (nothing?) in the 1 year since its inception.</p>

            <p>I would like to offer a few comments here.</p>
<p>from <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/lefterisjp">@lefterisjp</a> comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good software is built by 1-2 architects/CTO and a small, lean and effective development team.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt think a DAO can build good software. Perhaps it can hire a team that will be able to and maybe create a very good and clear specification for them to implement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My understanding is that a DAO is ‚Äújust‚Äù the organization model for running a project, the same that it could be an LLC. With so many people here involved in open software, and this being an important factor in the mission, how can we reach this conclusion? Aren‚Äôt there enough examples of good running open-source projects with high quality? (Linux, Gnome, WordPress, IETF, etc). Note, that I‚Äôm asking from total unknowledge,  I never participated in an open-source project.<br>
Btw, not sure if this could help: <a href="https://portal.devxdao.com/public-proposals/185" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://portal.devxdao.com/public-proposals/185</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lefteris has told me privately that full-time contributors to Rotki make $30k - $50k per year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôm in Europe too, we hire globally, and I‚Äôm not even able to attract juniors for a $30k salary. Our seniors are around $80k, and if I find a superstar is almost free check. I‚Äôm a startup with no too many resources, so imagine with what we are competing for talent. And I don‚Äôt believe that we would attract that talent just because they are aligned with the mission, people want/need to secure their future.<br>
I think the tech market is currently in a bubble and it doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs gonna explode at any time soon.<br>
On top of that, working for DAOs has many advantages, you can work for many DAOs at the same time ( this may be an advantage for the person, but I don‚Äôt think it is for the DAO, from my point of view if we detect good people, we want them 100% focus on us, and in their free time, enjoying their life, so they can recharge and come with energy the next day, maybe this is an old-fashing though). But it also has many risks from a stability perspective: I have one task now, but It‚Äôs not sure at all that I would have a new task once a finish this. So I would have to go out there hunting for new bounties, grants, or freelance jobs. What about illness? pregnancy, vacations, holidays? Along these lines, I was thinking about something to introduce some kind of recognition for the track record of a contributor: Hey, you have been here for 3 months, doing an excellent job, here you have an NFT, that you can exchange, at any time, for 2 days off (numbers from the example are just random). This could create loyalty from the contributors, and people may value this on top of just salary/reward.</p>

<p>I am starting to really see the value in some ‚Äústable‚Äù portion of compensation, and then a ‚Äúvariable‚Äù portion of compensation. Having to sell your voice (aka, governance tokens) to pay bills doesn‚Äôt feel good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I totally agree that people should sacrifice compensation for having a voice.<br>
This may be a total change of subject, but I‚Äôm investigating an alternative to 1-token-1-vote governance model. I like more a system based on reputation, where your reputation‚Äôs score rewards your alignment with the mission and penalizes the opposite. Those reputation points can‚Äôt be lifetime, I think they should work like the ATP ranking. So people needs to contribute constantly during periods of time, in order to keep their scoring, instead of doing one task and living from that reputation for the rest of their days.</p>

<p>Even in a worst case scenario of GTC going to $1 to 1.5 the dao will have ~$50 to $75 million (vested + unvested) in its treasury. So if we cap max spending at lets say 1.5 mil per season. Then even for 3 yrs (12 seasons) DAO would at max spend 18 mil i.e ~30-40% of treasury and hopefully by the end of 3 years we would be out of the bear market. In case if the market conditions improve we can remove the spending limit early.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is very short term vision. It doesn‚Äôt matter if this bear market last 3 years or the next one, or maybe there are some external factors that dump the price to zero. The DAO should look for a way to increase its revenue and be auto-sustainable.<br>
Managing the treasury and being sure that it can resist market conditions is one piece, but sooner or later, the treasury will be gone.<br>
Some quick ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Looks for financial contributors, there are a lot of non-profit organizations and foundations raising funds from wealthy people.</li>
<li>What about taking tokens/equity from the projects that the DAO helps?</li>
<li>I think there is a lot of knowledge in this DAO, many other DAOs can learn from it (I‚Äôm researching this in detail for the one that I‚Äôm creating). This DAO can create tools and service that facilitate the management of this DAO and charge for it to other DAOs.</li>
</ul>

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a> <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/loietaylor">@loietaylor</a> <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle">@kyle</a>  Do you think proposing &amp; setting a dao wide spending limit per season until grants 2.0 is shipped or until we are out of bear market make sense?</p>
<p>Even in a worst case scenario of GTC going to $1 to 1.5 the dao will have ~$50 to $75 million (vested + unvested) in its treasury. So if we cap max spending at lets say 1.5 mil per season. Then even for 3 yrs (12 seasons) DAO would at max spend 18 mil i.e ~30-40% of treasury and hopefully by the end of 3 years we would be out of the bear market. In case if the market conditions improve we can remove the spending limit early.</p>
<p>All workstreams should split this max budget i.e 1.5 mil based on their contribution levels for core DAO goals etc.</p>
<p>Couple of things to note:</p>
<ol>
<li>The spending limit per season can be a % of treasury rather a fixed USD amount like (1.5 mil).</li>
<li>The spending limits can be set both at DAO level &amp; individual work stream levels as well.</li>
<li>Along with a DAO wide comp policy, if we have a spending limit for each workstream, it makes it easier for the workstreams to reorganise themselves accordingly to fit the new spending limit.</li>
</ol>

            <p>This is an interesting conversation, and feels to me like it‚Äôs flipping the script on web3, in a negative way. The narrative during times of abundance was that web3/DAO work offers an alternative to web2 in that it gives you more flexibility and optionality in terms of what you can do, without having to sacrifice financial incentives. What I‚Äôm hearing in some of these recent conversations is flipping to a more ‚Äúif you‚Äôre passionate you‚Äôll work for below market rate and be open to being exploited‚Äù mindset, which has been highly toxic in the web2 non-profit space. I get that we‚Äôre entering times of scarcity, but I think we need to be mindful of the effects of this narrative-shift and what long-term effects it could have on the space.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is the costs associated with a significant compensation reduction - i.e. if there‚Äôs a mass exodus beacuse current contributors can no longer afford to work at Gitcoin DAO (given that a large proportion of the core team is in the US, where the salaries we offer aren‚Äôt excessive by most measures), how far back would this set current projects, and what would the costs of rehiring/restructuring the DAO be? Just think there‚Äôs a lot of nuance that needs to be taken into account when discussing people‚Äôs livelihoods haha.</p>

            <p>I love these types of ideas.</p>
<p>I am starting to really see the value in some ‚Äústable‚Äù portion of compensation, and then a ‚Äúvariable‚Äù portion of compensation. Having to sell your voice (aka, governance tokens) to pay bills doesn‚Äôt feel good.</p>
<p>I want to explore this a bit more and I wonder if anyone is interested in helping us map out some options?</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/lunacat">@Lunacat</a> - Want to join the conversations that <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/loietaylor">@loietaylor</a> may be facilitating soon?</p>
<p>A few things for us to cover on that call:<br>
1 - Options as Loie outlined on what it might mean to ‚Äúcut contributor pay‚Äù<br>
2 - Exploration on how to offer downside protection, and capped upside<br>
3 - Exploration on multiple token types to bridge the compensation/voting details.</p>
<p>I will defer to Loie on timing, but I know this is a top of mind for a few of us.</p>

<p>r/ethtrader donuts is another case study that could translate well to address this very fair concern.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/kl6ldu/donuts_faq/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Donuts FAQ</a>:</p>
<p><em>Q: What is CONTRIB?</em></p>
<p><em>A: Whenever a user earns donuts, they earn an equal amount of CONTRIB. CONTRIB is a separate token and is non-transferrable. It essentially shows life-time earnings, even if a user has sold their donuts. It can also be used to potentially restrict some actions to users that earned their donuts, rather than purchased them.</em></p>

<p>If we have a proper DAO treasury diversification plan we can offer the option to be compensated in stable coins.</p>
<p>An other long term option would be to use <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-utility-of-gtc/10071">GTC as a utility token</a> and create a new governance token.<br>
The <a href="https://github.com/gnosis/cow-token" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">virtual token</a> used for CowSwap seems to be an idea we could learn from.</p>
<p>Based on the twitter post above and the virtual token idea, we could compensate contributors with a standard ERC20 in conjunction with vGTC for which the amount could be weighted based on the contributions made or other params.<br>
But this would lead to a centralized governance model, so if anyone that is not a contributor wants to get involved in governance, then they could buy the utility GTC token and redeem it for vGTC.</p>
<p>PS: We‚Äôre thinking of creating something along those lines for dCompass DAO.</p>
