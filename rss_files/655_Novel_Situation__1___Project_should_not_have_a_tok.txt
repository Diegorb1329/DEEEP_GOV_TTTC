https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/novel-situation-1-project-should-not-have-a-token-or-raised-vc-funding/10029
    Novel Situation #1 - (A situation that suggests Gitcoin Policy needs updating...)

‚ÄúGrant Applicants should not have a token‚Äù

*TL:DR  This criteria is outdated since a large number of projects now use token based governance systems.  We can revise this to read "Grant applicants should not have a token other than governance tokens" to remain true to Gitcoin principals.  We need to update it because we are denying quality deserving projects that should be eligible imo.*

One of Gitcoin‚Äôs legacy eligibility criteria reads ‚Äúthe project should not have its own token or have raised VC funding‚Ä¶‚Äù  This comes from the earlier grant round criteria and is a carry over from a time when the general crypto space was less mature.  Daos were not yet popular and had not determined that token-based voting was the preferred decentralized decision making method.  

It is important to notice that the language in this guidance is suggestive (‚Äòshould‚Äô) and not mandatory (unlike with quid pro quo or hate speech criteria where the wording is ‚Äòmust‚Äô and/or ‚Äòshall‚Äô).  This criteria is suggestive in nature not a mandate.

The development of the dao, with token voting, marked a key shift in the general decentralization movement.  Now, for maybe the first time, groups of individuals could use legacy web2 tools combined with blockchain technology to rapidly coordinate around goals or themes.

Uniswap and Bankless might have been some of the earlier groups to become a dao and rapidly coordinate using governance tokens.  Both are long term recipients of Gitcoin grant donations.  The technique of creating and distributing governance tokens to a community which then forms (or already has formed) a Dao is commonplace.  Token based voting is the number one method by which daos govern imo.  Left alone, this system might be fine.  Unfortunately it exists within the framework of the free market.  

A market made even more free by the proliferation of pseudonymous and privacy enhancing tools and techniques associated with cryptocurrency and blockchains.  And this free market is very observant.  And created tokens become publicly accessible.  When some project shows success potential the market wants to invest in and have some control over said project.  The easiest way to do this is to accumulate governance tokens.  Many governance tokens end up with some ascribed value and are traded on both centralized and decentralized exchanges.  Even if this goes against the wishes/values of the founding team.

This creates the issue.  At one time Gitcoin banned projects with (monetary) tokens.  This was before tokens became the primary decentralized governance technique of daos.  Now we have projects that meet all the eligibility criteria except for the ‚Äò...should not have its own token‚Ä¶‚Äô item.  At this state in dao governance it seems inappropriate to deny funding to projects based on the existence of its own token.  More critical, is how the token is used. 
Greater investigation and analysis is called for.  Questions I might consider include:
Examine the initial token distribution- how decentralized vs just the founding team?
Examine the  general project tokenomics- how decentralized vs just the founding team?
Is the token actively used in governance?
How long was the token used in governance before it became traded on any exchange?
Is the token generating revenue and what happens to that revenue?
How much has the token increased in value since inception?
How much are the general operating expenses of the project? Using general operating expenses and token value change since inception, can it be determined if a project is earning or losing revenue?  Again what happens to that revenue?
What are the metrics around trading the token?  What is the total daily volume traded?  
Is token deflationary or inflationary? 
It is difficult to determine the true nature of a token without detailed financial auditing which goes beyond the expectations of an average grant reviewer.

In conclusion, I find it really is the reason for the existence of a given token that determines its effect on gitcoin eligibility.  Did the token get created to facilitate governance or to generate centralized profits.  If there is any evidence that the token got created for governance, I recommend the project be deemed eligible.  Even if the free market used the created token for speculation.  Unfortunately this opens the door to projects categorizing any and all tokens as gov tokens.  To mitigate this we may need to consider the greater reputation of a project in the space.
Lastly, I would change the official wording on that criteria to:

‚ÄúGrant Applicants should not have a token other than governance tokens.‚Äù

Would love to hear other opinions on this matter.  Do you think a project should be denied Gitcoin funding because it has a token used for governance?  Why or why not?

Here is what Bright ID stated to the fdd:

*Hi, Grants Appeals team,*

*I'd like to outline the case for our appeal of matching funds eligibility dispute. The matching eligibility was disputed on the basis of the recent launch of the $Bright token.*

*$Bright is a community token for the community surrounding BrightID to decide on its usage.*

*I understand and in general agree that projects that raise funds through a token sale should remove themselves from matching fund eligibility.*

*$Bright was not sold, however; it was given away to BrightID verified individuals, through a process we called the "fairdrop" ("fair" being used to signify that tokens were primarily distributed to unique humans, not wallets).*

*[Bright DAO is a 1Hive Gardens DAO](https://dao.brightid.org/) that only deals in its own token, $Bright. It is also not the entity that manages the BrightID Gitcoin grant.*

*The entity that manages the Gitcoin grant is a [Delaware non-profit Legal DAO called BrightID Main LLC](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-Constitution), receiving its non-profit sponsorship under the [Grantcoin Foundation (DBA Hedge for Humanity)](https://www.hedgeforhumanity.org/). Philip Silva is the member that has submitted KYC on behalf of the Delaware non-profit to be able to receive donations through Gitcoin. I have CC'ed him in this email.*

*Though I don't think any quid-pro-quo accusations were raised, I'll mention just in case that we were careful to avoid communication about the upcoming fairdrop in our grant description and tokens were fairdropped to Gitcoin contributors and projects based on their trust bonus usage, but not based on donating to BrightID.*

*More information about the $Bright [fairdrop](https://brightid.gitbook.io/brightid/bright/getting-bright/fairdrop) and [token in general](https://brightid.gitbook.io/brightid/bright/what-is-bright) are found in the [BrightID Gitbook](https://brightid.gitbook.io/brightid/).*

*It's my feeling that if $Bright receives enough price support that Bright DAO alone can fund the non-profit initiatives of BrightID, we should stop asking for donations from Gitcoin users, CLR.Fund users, Giveth users, and the Ethereum foundation. I hope we can reach that day soon.*

*Let us know if Philip or I can help clarify anything.*

*Feel free to make this appeal public. I don't believe I've said anything that shouldn't be public knowledge.*

*--Adam Stallard, Founder, BrightID*

<p>So, haven‚Äôt read all the comments yet, but if this is the case, we‚Äôre being inconsistent here.</p>
<p>Giveth is up &amp; running and receiving matching. And they have an entire tokenomics system set up (giveconomy)</p>
<p>BanklessDAO the exact same thing, they have 11 related grants up if I see it correctly, most important one being Bankless Academy I think.</p>
<p>All are receiving matching funds.</p>

            <p>I think I even detected an additional reason for BrightID to be permitted.  Adam explained the organization that created and manages the grant is called BrightID Main LLC yet the org that manages the token is Bright Dao, a 1hive Gardens Dao.  Although both share the word bright in the name they appear to be legally separate entities.  If this is true, then the grant applicant behind grant 191 actually does not have a token.</p>
<p>Adam can you confirm if these entities are legally separate?</p>

            <p>I just read through this whole discussion. I can say this, ‚ÄúWow.‚Äù Everyone‚Äôs point is well articulated, kind, fair, multi-faceted, etc.</p>
<p>I, for one, now have enough information to make an informed decision, so I look forward to a vote being put up.</p>
<p>If the above discussion is any indication of the appeal process, I think it basically worked. Although, I think we can all admit that this level of discussion cannot happen very often. My preference would be to see this type of decision pushed off onto the community. Maybe some way to say to the donors, ‚ÄúThis grant has been flagged as XYZ. Do you wish to help us decide?‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúDo you think this grant should be eligible for matching‚Ä¶‚Äù (Just thinking out loud.)</p>
<p>Also, I don‚Äôt feel any time pressure to get this done. As Joe points out this can be completed before the end of the round and, if I understand, no action means they get the match. This goes along with Ostrom‚Äôs principle of ‚Äúpunish infractions lightly at first and then ramp up‚Ä¶‚Äù I like that.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt feel that way at all.  You did an incredible job building out the dao.  I kinda wish you had gone even farther down the Centralization path during the last 6 months.  Because herding cats isn‚Äôt easy.  We were trying to do very serious consequential work and yet in the early days tbh there were a lot of clueless folks trying to figure out how to be a dao, myself included.  I think if you had been more bossy we might have skipped a couple challenges‚Ä¶at great cost ofc.</p>
<p>I feel the same about the GPG.  I trust them and I want their explicit guidance to build this thing right.  I suppose imo the ends justify the means.  We can always improve our decentralization but if we don‚Äôt succeed operationally our decentralization debt is meaningless.  I am aware that some people feel differently, feel that maximum decentralization is needed.</p>

DisruptionJoe

            <p>I‚Äôd like to add here that I am making a small decision in a domain where I have had the responsibility to make the decisions for the last 5 rounds. With FDD, we have been creating more transparency and community participation, but when a grants policy or sybil defense decision needs to be made it has fallen mostly on me.</p>
<p>Now that we are communicating in this transparent forum, I am worried people will see me making a decision and claim ‚Äúthat isn‚Äôt decentralized!‚Äù</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt want anyone to get the impression that I feel I have the authority and am abusing it. The number of decisions that were required in the past 5 rounds was enormous. Most of the time, I would seek input from the team where my concerns were heard, but no one was interested in participating in making these decisions. Issues which are causing problems now like the attachment of the main round and ethereum round are issues I have been calling out since GR8.</p>
<p>Even during GR11 the PGF group wasn‚Äôt running the grants ops yet. Not to complain at all. I just want the public forum readers to know I‚Äôm not a benevolent dictator. I‚Äôm more the benevolent guy who happened to be in the role of responsibility to make sure shit didn‚Äôt hit the fan!</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Setting the thresholds in an arbitrary and lightly defined way is already happening. The complexities of the side rounds needing to be included in the main ethereum round is what is causing many of the gray area policy issues. There are also a few where I or Kevin made a decision in the past that ended up as a soft precedent, but isn‚Äôt written or defined.</p>
<p>The policy squad is looking to complete the audit and rewrite the full policy this season. From there it can be updated via the appeals system rather than arbitrary judgement calls from our or PGF team. Are we both on the same page that an appeals system to update precedent using the english common law model is a path we should continue on?</p>
<p>Lastly, I  agree with you that PGF should own the policy in the future, specifically grants operations. Let‚Äôs talk more about this in CSDO.</p>

<p>My logic is based on the original reason a project creates a token. If it appears the token was created for governance purposes, not revenue-generation, then imo it should be eligible.</p>

<p>My logic has the obvious problem of projects fraudulently labelling their token as ‚Äògovernance‚Äô when it was designed to create profit. I agree this will be a continuing problem however the steps I describe will empower Gitcoin reviewers and approvers to make the final call, based on judgement and experience. Now they don‚Äôt get the chance and great projects like Giveth and BrightID are getting denied. Feels wrong to me as I can‚Äôt think of more suitable projects for Gitcoin funding.</p>

<p>Working on the frontier of web 3 is exciting, but sometimes it means we are making this up as we go. Our legitimacy at this point isn‚Äôt from following the letter of the law, but from having a clear purpose, communicating our decisions in the post round governance briefs, and getting better round over round.</p>
<p>I see no reason why a rule that I wrote about a year ago which has seen <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/zero.png?v=12" title=":zero:" class="emoji" alt=":zero:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> uses thus far can‚Äôt be mended to provide the proper intention of our policy.</p>
<p>As we have matured, we have realized the need for a system based in English common law which can remove bias and provides a pathway for updating our precedent. Once this system is fully in place, then we can be 100% letter of the law, but we are still building that system now.</p>
<p>This community (ethereum/gitcoin) went through the DAO hard fork and realized that code isn‚Äôt law. In this case, the law isn‚Äôt law yet because it isn‚Äôt built on a solid substrate that is resilient to outside pressures.</p>

</aside>
<p>That‚Äôs actually the way we handled all the situations thus far, but I agree that we should have a more ‚Äúclear‚Äù policy or GE criteria in the near future.<br>
Personally as a former ‚Äúgrant reviewer‚Äù I know from my experience that there are a LOT of cases that could be labeled as a ‚Äúdouble standard‚Äù.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/connor">@connor</a>‚Äôs vision could be a solution, namely separating the main and cause/ecosystem‚Äôs rounds eligibility criteria and processing, but won‚Äôt that just expand the ‚Äúdouble standard‚Äù scenario to the ecosystem/cause rounds?<br>
Like, selling a novel use case NFT would be ok in the <strong>climate round,</strong> but the same thing would be forbidden in the main round if they use the funds made after selling the NFT to build houses or smth like that(which doesn‚Äôt have it‚Äôs own round yet). Maybe I‚Äôm taking this to far <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=12" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p>I want to make sure we aren‚Äôt talking past each other here, <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/disruptionjoe">@DisruptionJoe</a> - Grants that have tokens, or even VC funding, I feel should still be ‚Äúactive‚Äù and ‚Äúvisible‚Äù on the platform. Users should have the option to fund them (ideally the Grant owner is clear about this fact though), and if there are clear disqualifying criteria they should be marked inactive/no longer visible.</p>
<p>In this case, I feel BrightID should be active on the platform, but ‚Äúis CLR eligible‚Äù should be disabled. These are options in the admin so folks see that we have multiple options:<br>
</p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/0/09902d4fd0dbac2f407bc25af07fc9b92f8b3f12.jpeg" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/1mBc5H83FN3rkVbO5RIWseSc9I6.jpeg?dl=1" title="image"><img src="/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/0/09902d4fd0dbac2f407bc25af07fc9b92f8b3f12_2_690x323.jpeg" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="1mBc5H83FN3rkVbO5RIWseSc9I6" width="690" height="323" srcset="/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/0/09902d4fd0dbac2f407bc25af07fc9b92f8b3f12_2_690x323.jpeg, /uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/0/09902d4fd0dbac2f407bc25af07fc9b92f8b3f12_2_1035x484.jpeg 1.5x, /uploads/db4391/original/2X/0/09902d4fd0dbac2f407bc25af07fc9b92f8b3f12.jpeg 2x" data-small-upload="/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/0/09902d4fd0dbac2f407bc25af07fc9b92f8b3f12_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>I do agree with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/annika">@annika</a> that setting thresholds and clarifying this would be wonderful. I appreciate that the BrightID Grant is a strong impetus for us to do this. When we launched GTC, the goal was to have PGF define these criteria and then have FDD help confirm compliance.</p>
<p>Thanks for the discussion thus far, I love that this is pushing us to be better.</p>

connor

            <p>Copying some of my general comments on the topic from Discord - (not necessarily in response to BrightID or any other grantee):</p>
<p>For ecosystem rounds, it‚Äôs ultimately up to the round partner to decide. Hence why we really need to decouple side rounds (cause or eco) from the main pool in the future - ideally before gr14.</p>
<p>But I think there are plenty of reasonable cases where a project has a token but didn‚Äôt do a large fundraise (or a fundraise of any kind). Also ‚Äútoken‚Äù is getting vaguer all the time. NFTs are tokens. Voting/governance tokens, non-transferable tokens - just having a token doesn‚Äôt always imply a large treasury to fund a project.</p>
<p>So I think it‚Äôs really a case-by-case situation. A fundraise or liquidity event should def be a pivotal moment, but even so, I think a project that raises a $200k seed round or something could arguably still qualify. There are projects that may have gotten large grants from other programs, non-profits that are funded via donations, maybe a project won a big hackathon prize, the line is blurry. If I had to draw a line, I‚Äôd say raising &gt; $500k should def disqualify you.</p>

            <p>Catching up here and first off, thanks <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/david_dyor">@David_Dyor</a> for flagging this.</p>
<p>Our ‚Äúshould not have a token‚Äù is a nebulous policy - and, for what it‚Äôs worth, is actually nowhere explicitly within the application flow - and I appreciate the opportunity for us to get more explicit and offer clearer guidelines to the community.</p>
<p>My initial reaction to the situation is that we will have to set objective guidance, and I don‚Äôt think some of the current proposed solutions lend themselves to that.</p>
<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúGrant Applicants should not have a token other than governance tokens.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This suggestion is clearer and more explicit, but IMO, this is still far too inclusive. There are projects with governance tokens that have billions in market cap and certainly do not meet the ethos of Gitcoin grants, based on their stage. I do not think governance tokens as an arbitrary cutoff makes sense for that reason.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt think the existence of a token alone should preclude a project from being part of Gitcoin Grants; as you suggest, <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/david_dyor">@David_Dyor</a>, the landscape has evolved and many, many early-stage projects that I believe the community would deem eligible for grants do have small token experiments. That said, we have to draw the line somewhere.</p>
<p>A couple suggestions, perhaps, to get the ball rolling:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What if we allowed governance tokens that have not yet crossed a certain market cap? E.g., market cap has never been above $20M</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also still believe that VC funding is a material, measurable event that often greatly shifts a project‚Äôs priorities. I am in favour of keeping something like the $500K VC funding threshold (I would perhaps up that amount, but would love to hear what the community thinks).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>TLDR: I‚Äôd propose we work towards some combination of objective metrics like the above two. These will, inevitably, be somewhat arbitrary - and we‚Äôll likely need to experiment and adjust - but in order to scale this program and our approval process, we need to get explicit and start somewhere.</p>

<p>The current appeal process was written by me when we were in stage 1 above! I had no clue how cumbersome the idea of having stewards vote on every appeal could be, or the damage it could do to a grant by making it ineligible while we formed our processes to execute said vote.</p>

</aside>
<p>I now believe it is the best way forward for the dao, though cumbersome (temporarily).   It would be difficult to evaluate fringe cases as just one of many dao-workstreams when the precedent set could have major future ripples.  I agree with Joe that a full Steward Vote is suitable.  We can probably shave a day or two off by improving the workflow needed to obtain the full steward signal.</p>

<p>I understood that eligibility for future rounds might also be at stake, but I didn‚Äôt think they would be blocked because the appeal was still underway; I thought they would only be blocked if the appeal was denied.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>We did not anticipate that the appeal would take this long. I think there was miscommunication in FDD in terms of ownership of executing the appeal which may have been outside of <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/david_dyor">@David_Dyor</a>  scope as he owned the outcome of building out the appeals system. I believe we focused on building the system rather than executing on getting BrightID through it properly and in a timely way.</p>
<p><strong>For this round</strong></p>
<p>The BrightID grant <span class="hashtag-raw">#191</span> is currently set as active and eligible for matching. We will execute on the appeal process during the next week. This could be compared to letting the defendant be free while awaiting trial vs being jailed while waiting trial.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Outcome <span class="hashtag-raw">#1</span> - Appeal is successful / Ruling Overturned</strong></p>
<p>In the case the community wishes to revise the policy (maybe how David suggests above), then their grant will remain active AND eligible for GR13 matching. In addition, we would follow up with a governance request to make a payment to BrightID equivalent to their matching lost in GR12.</p>
<p>Because this is a first, we don‚Äôt know if the community would prefer us to spend more from the matching pool to resolve this or if they feel that it is fair for the project to have lost these funds (or don‚Äôt receive them as a right, but more as a privilege). The snopshot vote would answer this question and set precedent for the future.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Outcome <span class="hashtag-raw">#2</span> - Appeal is not successfull - Ruling is not Overturned</strong></p>
<p>In this situation, BrightID‚Äôs grant <span class="hashtag-raw">#191</span> will be made ineligible for matching funds on the Gitcoin backend prior to the final calculations for GR13.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs my feeling that if $Bright receives enough price support that Bright DAO alone can fund the non-profit initiatives of BrightID, we should stop asking for donations from Gitcoin users, CLR.Fund users, Giveth users, and the Ethereum foundation. I hope we can reach that day soon.</p>

</aside>
<p>When might this be? What threshold feels appropriate?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>We have a had a hiring freeze on our core team since the launch of Bright DAO.  We‚Äôre slowly reducing our team and trying to transition them to be contributors to Bright DAO instead and reducing core team to a minimum support staff to manage the ‚Äúcentralized‚Äù pieces of BrightID.  (App store listings, website, other web accounts, test hardware, etc.) Once this transition is done, the financial needs of BrightID core should probably go down from $30,000 / month to $10,000 / month, and BrightID Main DAO will need less grant money.</p>

<p>(They already lost GR12 funding.)</p>

</aside>
<p>To be clear, we received funds in GR12 directly from contributors, but didn‚Äôt receive the matching because a dispute was raised‚ÄìI believe by Joe? When <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/disruptionjoe">@DisruptionJoe</a> approached me about using BrightID as a test case for both the appeals process and the question of whether launching a community token should disqualify a project, I thought this sounded like a great idea, with the assumption that what was at stake was the GR12 matching funds‚Äìwhich for us is a significant amount, but we didn‚Äôt need those funds urgently at the time.</p>
<p>I understood that eligibility for future rounds would also be at stake, but I didn‚Äôt think they would be blocked because the appeal was still underway; I thought they would only be blocked if the appeal was denied.</p>
<p>Like I said, we also hope to move away from needing Gitcoin grants, but we‚Äôre not there yet. In fact, we‚Äôre currently gearing up to apply for other kinds of grants.</p>
<p>So I am curious if the matching funds from GR12 are really gone‚Äìif they go away whenever there is a dispute, even that dispute is later nullified by a successful appeal.</p>
