Workstream Suggestion: multiple language support

    Currently there are 5 posts and 2 votes (on snapshots) about multiple language in discussion, please see the reference.

There is one workstream of Decentralize Gitcoin, I believe multiple language should be part of decentralization. 

If we care about multiple language support, maybe we could gather the feedback from the community, (or a poll) and then make decision to support what language first.

            <p>Looking at what this platform stands for, I would say that this is a nice idea…multi language forum will aid help to unanswered questions…and make this community more friendly. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/black_heart.png?v=9" title=":black_heart:" class="emoji" alt=":black_heart:"></p>

            <p>Thanks for organizing all these threads Bob, I’d personally love to see more multi-language support. Based on the threads, I do think Mandarin makes the most sense to start.</p>
