GitcoinDAO Digest

Edition #19

- Weekly highlights and hot topics from the GitcoinDAO community

Welcome to the GitcoinDAO Digest, a community-led publication with TLDR-summaries of the most important discussions and proposals in the GitcoinDAO, along with relevant links for further reading! Without further ado, let‚Äôs dive in!

### [ü§ñ Meta-Governance](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/governance-meta/6)

* [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki) published [The ImpactDAO/ProtocolDAO Sandwich sandwich ü•™](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-impactdao-protocoldao-sandwich/8944), which describes how he perceives Gitcoin‚Äôs place in the emerging DAO ecosystems as a ProtocolDAO/ImpactDAO Sandwich:
‚ÄúA ProtocolDAO is a DAO that is centered around a crypto-economic protocol.

An ImpactDAO is a DAO that is oriented around the creation of positive externalities.‚Äù

* We‚Äôre continuing to lean into ecosystem rounds, where projects run their own matching pools alongside the main Gitcoin matching pool. Check out this recent [case study that highlights Uniswap‚Äôs goals, experience and results](https://gitcoin.co/blog/case-study-uniswap-grants-program-ugp-gitcoin-partnered-to-distribute-ecosystem-funds/) using ecosystem rounds in GR11.

* [November 2021; Who‚Äôs hiring?](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/november-2021-whos-hiring/8946) by [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki) invites workstream leads of the DAO to announce the currently open positions in their respective workstream. If you‚Äôre interested in taking on a role in the GitcoinDAO -- this is a great way to start!

* [Non-transferrable governance token for ‚Äústructured workstreams‚Äù to signal contributor interests](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/non-transferrable-governance-token-for-structured-workstreams-to-signal-contributor-interests/8985) by [DisruptionJoe](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/DisruptionJoe) proposes to ‚Äúcreate a governance token for all workstreams that choose to collaborate rather than defect‚Äù from the decisions of The CrossStream DAOops Governance (SDG) council.

* [Codingsh](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/codingsh) authored a proposal which introduces [dExplorer](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-dexplorer-bounty-fund-bounty/8960), a project which aims to improve and decentralize the Bounties platform.

## [üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Workstream Discussion](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/workstream-discussion/9)

### üå± [Public Goods Funding](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-public-goods-funding/129)

* New squads are starting to form around Public Goods PR (workstream awareness), NFT artist sales for public goods, and smaller token alliances with groups like [Verses](https://twitter.com/notscottmoore/status/1457885830333308928), [DreamDAO](https://twitter.com/garysheng), and more.

* As we get closer to being able to execute small test token swaps, we have also begun to seed and fund a number of other partnerships with orgs including [DeveloperDAO](https://twitter.com/developer_dao), [Verses](https://twitter.com/notscottmoore/status/1457885830333308928), [PadawanDAO](https://forum.metacartel.org/t/the-padawan-dao/1653) (TBD), and [DreamDAO](https://twitter.com/garysheng).

* Fundraising and grants operations continue to ramp up as GR12 approaches

* The public goods library has more participation than ever, consistently maxing out the Discord room limit.

* The Gitcoin Holdings team is starting to connect more deeply with this work as part of ‚Äúthe great migration‚Äù into the DAO!

### [üöÄ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-prototyping-workstream-moonshot-budget-request-q4-2021/8785) [Moonshot Collective](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-public-goods-prototyping/130)

* The [Q4 Budget for Moonshot Collective](https://www.withtally.com/governance/gitcoin/proposal/8) passed on Tally and is queued for execution.

* We‚Äôve reached Level 3 in [The Greatest LARP](https://greatestlarp.com/) with more than 200 ETHBots minted and over $270,000 raised for public goods! [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki) [shared](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-governance-question-for-greatestlarp-com/8848/26) the current bonding curve with a poll to ratify a new womp womp policy for level 3. Do you hold any of the first 200 ETHbots minted? Congratulations, you get a special prize 3D-bot! Check out Level 2 on [greatestlarp.com](https://greatestlarp.com/) for more details.

* Want to get caught up on what Moonshot Collective was up to in October? MC co-lead [Kevin Owocki](https://twitter.com/owocki) sat down with Matt Carano to talk it through ‚Äî what went well, what we learned, and what‚Äôs next. [Watch the video here](https://youtu.be/XUxN1B8S6vU).

* Help Wanted: Moonshot Collective is looking for a Product Manager and React devs. If you‚Äôre interested, please say hello in the [Moonshot Collective](https://moonshotcollective.space/) telegram.

### üåê [Decentralize Gitcoin](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-decentralize-gitcoin/180)

* [dGTC Workstream Q4 Budget Proposal](https://www.withtally.com/governance/gitcoin/proposal/9) has now passed the quorum on Tally.

* The vote to ratify the [dCompass Budget Request](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0x230bcb7d3548048fc94e5745f7934d80bfc357632af1038cb0941fc54fbae021) for Q4 2021 has passed and steps have been taken to propose a formal on-chain vote.

* Payouts for the Moonshot Collective round have been executed.

* Development related to running a round in Grants Round 12 is ramping up. Priorities include Performance, My Grants page, My Donations page, GrantRegistry, and Contract Updates.

* The team is preparing to build the ML pipeline infrastructure.

* dGitcoin is starting to gather DAO-wide data needs from stakeholders

### üíô [Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)](https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/Fraud-Detection-Defense-f1a2969a9f324f57a02ef69a60b25cae)

* The team needs a top Steward to create the proposal on Tally after Q4 Budget passed last week on Snapshot. Many seem confused by the double vote on Snapshot and Tally. Snapshot is where the vote takes place after a deliberation period on the governance forum. Tally is essentially a multisig with 18k keyholders!

* All contributor payments for Q3 have been made. FDD spent less than the projected budget on the initiatives listed on the original proposal. Our support of CrossStream DAOops including onboarding, Notion revamp, and others put our total spending for the Quarter at around $5-10k over the 25k GTC Q3 proposal budget estimate at a price of $10/GTC.

* The first forking of a squad has happened. The grants approval squad split into two squads each with their own mechanism for splitting dRewards. The initial effect has been more engagement by the initiators of the fork to prep and train new onboards. We‚Äôll report back on long term effects.

* Sybil Detection took a big step forward as we connected the different teams on Q4 deliverables and forward-looking vision. These include the Gitcoin Holdings GPG team, dGrants, Data & DevOps stream, Omnianalytics, and Blockscience. Deliverables can be found on the FDD homepage.

* The FDD research group is picking up steam as a bottom-up governance designed stream from the start. They will have 4 researchers participating in the TE Governauts Open Science program studying DAO Compensation Policies. As GitcoinDAO doesn‚Äôt have enough history to provide good data for a study of this type, we thought it would be advantageous to pay GitcoinDAO contributors to participate as researchers studying the results in other DAOs.

### üé® [Merch, Memes & Marketing](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-suggestion-mmm-merch-memes-marketing-for-public-goods-gitcoin-gitcoindao/7066)

* The [Q4 budget](https://www.withtally.com/governance/gitcoin/proposal/7) has been transferred to the [MMM-Multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0xC23DA3Ca9300571B9CF43298228353cbb3E1b4c0/balances). Compensation for contributors and other expenses for October will be sent out this week. Our first Raid proposals will also be awarded. If you‚Äôre part of another workstream and you need design/marketing support from MMM - please utilize our [Request Typeform](https://form.typeform.com/to/iM5lAFFD)!

* Memepalooza #3 happened last Friday! The event lasted three hours and hosted 74 unique visitors who contributed to the creation of 100+ memes accompanied by a live DJ streaming from Twitch. Participants were awarded POAPs and GTC. There was also an NFT-raffle and some Schwag Store coupons given away to some excellent Meme lords.

* The playtesting-phase of the Degen vs Regen-card game has been completed. Thanks to everyone who participated! Tweaks to game mechanics as well as artwork are being worked on and finalized. Once done, we‚Äôll be hosting recurring tournaments with the broader community.

* If you‚Äôre a schwag-designer, don‚Äôt miss out on the [GR12 Schwag design bounty](https://gitcoin.co/issue/gitcoinco/creative/412/100026987) - $500 will be awarded to the best designer, with smaller rewards to the runner-up. There‚Äôs still time left to apply!

### üìÖ [Upcoming community events](https://www.addevent.com/calendar/pz351122)

* Drop in on our weekly [DAO Vibes & Office Hours w. Kevin Owocki](https://www.addevent.com/event/Vn9031075) on Wednesdays at 12PM EDT in [Discord](http://gitcoin.co/discord)! We have been seeing great attendance and engagement.

The next one is Monday, November 22, 1:00pm - 2:00pm ET. (If you haven‚Äôt applied, [do this first!](https://form.typeform.com/to/DiMdHaWe))

<ul>
<li>
<p>The team needs a top Steward to create the proposal on Tally after Q4 Budget passed last week on Snapshot. Many seem confused by the double vote on Snapshot and Tally. Snapshot is where the vote takes place after a deliberation period on the governance forum. Tally is essentially a multisig with 18k keyholders!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All contributor payments for Q3 have been made. FDD spent less than the projected budget on the initiatives listed on the original proposal. Our support of CrossStream DAOops including onboarding, Notion revamp, and others put our total spending for the Quarter at around $5-10k over the 25k GTC Q3 proposal budget estimate at a price of $10/GTC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first forking of a squad has happened. The grants approval squad split into two squads each with their own mechanism for splitting dRewards. The initial effect has been more engagement by the initiators of the fork to prep and train new onboards. We‚Äôll report back on long term effects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sybil Detection took a big step forward as we connected the different teams on Q4 deliverables and forward-looking vision. These include the Gitcoin Holdings GPG team, dGrants, Data &amp; DevOps stream, Omnianalytics, and Blockscience. Deliverables can be found on the FDD homepage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The FDD research group is picking up steam as a bottom-up governance designed stream from the start. They will have 4 researchers participating in the TE Governauts Open Science program studying DAO Compensation Policies. As GitcoinDAO doesn‚Äôt have enough history to provide good data for a study of this type, we thought it would be advantageous to pay GitcoinDAO contributors to participate as researchers studying the results in other DAOs.</p>

<p>Memepalooza <span class="hashtag">#3</span> happened last Friday! The event lasted three hours and hosted 74 unique visitors who contributed to the creation of 100+ memes accompanied by a live DJ streaming from Twitch. Participants were awarded POAPs and GTC.
