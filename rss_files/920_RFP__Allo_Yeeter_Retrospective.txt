## Learning About Allo Yeeter

Our journey with Allo Yeeter began when Owocki shared the Gitcoin RFP link in the Greenpill Network‚Äôs Discord development channel. Encouraged by the potential impact, the Greenpill Dev Guild brainstormed, strategized, and submitted a proposal with a 10,000 GTC budget.

**RFP (Retroactive Funding Proposal)**

**Dev Guild Proposal**

https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/rfp-allo-yeeter-build/19277/8?u=oba-one

**Key Milestones:**

* **Synergy Points** : Evan from the CFCE team joined our call while we were reviewing Owocki's Loom video on Allo Yeeter and immediately recognized strong parallels with his team‚Äôs work on GiveArb for ReFi in Arb. This sparked a productive discussion that led to a collaborative effort with CFCE, culminating in the formation of a detailed proposal by the meeting‚Äôs end.
* **Wireframes & Initial Thoughts** : Early-stage exploration of potential user flows and technical architecture sparked questions at a protocol level and clarity on the desired user experience.

## CFCE X Greenpill Dev Guild Partnership

This project brought together the unique strengths of the Greenpill Dev Guild and CFCE to deliver a robust product. The seeds of the partnership started during the ReFi in Arb grant program which saw two of our projects GiveArb and Green Goods receive funds to build regenerative tools. That grant set the foundation for future collaboration and these were some key aspects:

* **Shared Vision** : Drawing inspiration from parallels with CFCE‚Äôs GiveArb platform, we integrated expertise in fund distribution tools for Web3 ecosystems.
* **Complementary Strengths** : While the Greenpill Dev Guild led product development and management, CFCE focused on smart contract engineering, with unified efforts for research and business development.
* **Collaboration Wins** : The partnership proved highly effective, creating a foundation for future growth opportunities

## Allo Thoughts & Feedback

One of the central questions we grappled with during the development of Allo Yeeter was whether the tool truly needed to be built on Allo. Initial thoughts we shared in early discussion is that similar functionality could be achieved using simpler solutions, such as splits contracts. This observation brought into question the necessity of using the Allo protocol for a relatively straightforward tool. Fast forward to 2025 we proposed a news proposal and initial feedback is Allo Yeeter might not need to rely on the Allo protocol at all, and instead could leverage existing blockchain primitives. While this shift opens up new possibilities for development, it also raises concerns about the alignment of future iterations with the original RFP goals shifting.

Despite these questions, we identified several key benefits of integrating with Allo:

* **Builder Network Effects** : The most compelling reason to use Allo is the network effects it offers. By leveraging the Allo ecosystem, we can tap into a vibrant community of builders who contribute to advancing the protocol. This creates opportunities to integrate new features, collaborate on marketing efforts, and form partnerships to accelerate adoption. Additionally, access to Allo.expert and other Allo-focused developer communities simplifies talent acquisition and enables a more seamless onboarding process for engineers who are already familiar with the stack.
* **Profile Registry** : One of the standout features of integrating with Allo is the profile registry system. This allows fund managers to create a single, unified profile when performing their first ‚ÄúYeet.‚Äù Over time, these profiles serve as a valuable record of fund allocations, providing transparency and insight into the quality and consistency of allocations across the ecosystem. Instead of transactions being scattered across chains and wallets, the registry ensures a centralized, trackable point of reference for fund managers, which is particularly useful for evaluating impact and accountability within the ecosystem.

From a developer experience standpoint, engagement with the Allo team proved beneficial but occasionally challenging. The team‚Äôs limited bandwidth in developer relations led to delays in strategic alignment. However, their documentation and codebase were well-organized, which helped streamline our progress. We utilized the Allo starter kit to bootstrap development with a coding environment built for Allo development. Collaborative sessions with the Allo team provided valuable templates for funding strategies and clarified areas where the protocol could be improved.

---

## Exploring Allo Yeeter Use Cases

To further explore Allo Yeeter‚Äôs potential, we organized a workshop to demo the tool and identify additional use cases. This interactive session allowed us to showcase the functionality of Allo Yeeter and gather real-time feedback from participants, paving the way for future development. Discussions highlighted the tool‚Äôs flexibility and its potential to address various needs within the Web3 ecosystem.

The workshop explored several key directions:

* **Traditional Organizations** : Participants discussed the tool‚Äôs capacity to onboard nonprofits and NGOs, offering them a seamless way to distribute funds on-chain.
* **Recipient Features** : Ideas were shared about enhancing the recipient experience, including features like notifications, prioritization, and off-ramping options for funds.
* **Web3 Event Protocols** : Incorporating integrations like POAP could make Allo Yeeter a go to solution for event based fund distributions, connecting attendance data directly to payouts.
* **Internal Payout Tool** : Allo Yeeter has the potential to serve as a reusable tool for DAOs and other communities, enabling circular fund management and recycling GMV within the Allo ecosystem.

These discussions underscored Allo Yeeter‚Äôs versatility and its potential to address the needs of both emerging and established organizations. Moving forward, we aim to expand its use cases while aligning with the broader goals of the Gitcoin and Allo ecosystems.

## Closing Thoughts

Our collaboration with Gitcoin and CFCE on Allo Yeeter has been a valuable learning experience. From technical insights to community-driven feedback, the journey has enriched our understanding of creating impactful Web3 tools. We look forward to advancing this partnership, refining Allo Yeeter, and scaling its use cases to benefit the broader ecosystem. We currently have a new proposal on the forum to grow Allo Yeeter.
