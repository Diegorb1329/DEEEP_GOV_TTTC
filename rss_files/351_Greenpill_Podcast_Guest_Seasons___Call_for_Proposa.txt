Greenpill Podcast Guest Seasons - Call for Proposals!
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/greenpill-podcast-guest-seasons-call-for-proposals/18754
    *TLDR - I am going to step away from the Greenpill Podcast in Q3/Q4 2024 + am looking for ppl to guest cohost during that time.*

Hi all,

For those of you who are unaware, I have been hosting the [Greenpill Podcast](https://greenpill.network/) for the last 2 years. This podcast has been a way I can democratize my context + access to the rest of the ecosystem, research in public, vision-cast, and generally just explore the frontiers of regen web3.

We‚Äôve produced nearly 200 episodes and have had 300k+ listens, as well as about ~2k subscribers. I‚Äôm very proud of the content we‚Äôve created and the role Greenpill has played in supporting the regen movement.

But I think it is time to evolve it forward.

I am considering decentralizing my hosting duties for seasons 5, 6, and 7 to guest co-hosts who can go deep on a handful of different target niches.

Why do this?

1. I am busy with Gitcoin stuff and dont have cycles to do another season of GP (and do it well) with my current workload.
2. Decentralizing the workload (and the spotlight) to other leaders in the GP community.
3. Enabling people to go deep in areas where I dont have access.

Some topics I would love to see covered in season 4,5,6:

1. Commons in the 21st century
2. ReStaking Ecosystem <> Regen Ecosystems
3. Regen Network States
4. Weird/Fun Fundraising Experiments
5. Crypto in the Global South
6. What am I missing?

If you are interested in being a host of a season, please submit a proposal via comment below.

Risks

1. Need to keep content quality high.
2. The audience knows kevin, need to transfer rapport to new hosts.

Things I would want to see in a proposal to be credible.

* Season Title
* Season Goals
* Why is this relevant to the greenpill audience in H2 2024?
* Timeline
* Proposed Episodes + Guests
* Do you have podcast hosting experience? Links to previous work pls.
* Are you a known quantity to the regen ecosystem? Links to previous work pls.
* Whats your favorite greenpill episode + why?
* Do you have time to record 5-15 episodes in the next couple quarters?
* How will you ensure the episode is quality + relevant to the audience?

Timeline

* Proposals open May 15th
* Finalists, Top ~7 proposals selected for final round of evaluation - June 3
* Next Seasons selected + Announced - June 10
* Recording + Next Seasons Airing - July - December 2024
* Reevaluate next steps end 2024.

            <p>Gm. Thanks for the opportunity to submit this proposal . Huge fan of Greenpill. Here‚Äôs a proposal from V DAO</p>
<p><strong>Season Title:</strong> Building Regenerative Network States</p>
<p><strong>Season Goals:</strong> We‚Äôll explore the building blocks of regenerative network states with key leaders in the field. This series will give listeners a deeper understanding of what tools and approaches can help us transition out of the meta-crisis and into a more regenerative and anti-fragile paradigm.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this relevant to the greenpill audience in H2 2024?</strong></p>
<p>The Greenpill audience has been interested in Metacrisis themes and topics for some time. It‚Äôs very easy to get stuck in analysis paralysis and even emotional overwhelm in response to these issues. A key question remains, how can we build the third attractor? We believe that the answer lies in the regenerative network states space and we want to introduce the audience to practical regenerative  and antifragile solutions that are high tech, high nature and high humanity.</p>
<p><strong>Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Q3 / Q4 2024</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Episodes + Guests</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Next Supercycle</strong></p>
<p>This episode sets the stage for the season by discussing the evolution of human civilization, the challenges facing us today, where we are in the current supercycle, and what the next supercycle looks like.</p>
<p><em>Guests:</em> Joseph Lubin, Rob Avis, Marc Ziade</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Beyond Sustainability: Regenerative Living</strong></p>
<p>Introducing the concept of regenerative living, focusing on partnering with nature and leveraging technology to usher into a positive future. This includes the paradigm shift from degenerative to sustainable to regenerative and the implications surrounding that. The episode will also highlight bottom-up action and how to bring regenerative living to our everyday life.</p>
<p><em>Guests:</em> Rob Avis, Marc Ziade</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Autonomous Regenerative Properties</strong></p>
<p>Transforming our houses and properties from depreciating assets to living assets able to generate their own energy, water, food, money, etc.</p>
<p><em>Guests:</em> Rob Avis, Marc Ziade</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regenerative Network States</strong></p>
<p>Sharing a vision for how we can usher into a more regenerative and decentralized future and why regenerative network states are essential for a positive future for our planet and humanity.</p>
<p><em>Guests:</em> Rob Avis, Marc Ziade</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Do you have podcast hosting experience? Links to previous work please.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we have lots of experience as hosts and guests in recorded discussions on this topic, including a panel at ETH Denver and our monthly twitter spaces. Rob is also an experienced youtuber with over a decade of content in the regenerative living space.</p>
<p><strong>Are you a known quantity to the regen ecosystem? Links to previous work please.</strong></p>
<p>V DAO is a regenerative network state DAO that is well known within the regen ecosystem.</p>
<p>V DAO is being incubated by 5thworld, a regenerative living company based out of Canada. Verge Permaculture, the education arm of 5thworld, has over 12 years of experience facilitating regenerative land design courses, including rainwater harvesting, passive solar greenhouse design and permaculture design.</p>
<p><strong>What‚Äôs your favorite greenpill episode + why?</strong></p>
<p>Our favorite greenpill episode is the Daniel Schmachtenberger pod because he lays out in such a cogent way the challenges humanity is currently facing. This conversation introduced metacrisis concepts to many new people and inspired action with finding the third attractor.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have time to record 5-15 episodes in the next couple quarters?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we have.</p>
<p><strong>How will you ensure the episode is quality + relevant to the audience?</strong></p>
<p>We will ensure the quality and relevance of each episode by seeking feedback from the community after each pod and course correcting if necessary.</p>

The hosts‚Äô expertise and networks within the Gitcoin ecosystem will ensure the season remains relevant and valuable to the Greenpill audience.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Greenpill Episode</strong></p>
<p>Sov‚Äôs favorite Greenpill episode is the discussion on coordination mechanisms with Griff Green and Kevin Owocki. Their exploration into various coordination approaches, such as quadratic funding and DAOs, and how these mechanisms can support public goods, foster community engagement, and drive positive change made this episode an invaluable resource. I have recommended it to at least 100 people, as it is a must-listen for anyone interested in the future of decentralized collaboration and the potential of Web3 to drive positive change.</p>
<p><strong>Availability and Commitment</strong></p>
<p>The hosts are fully committed to dedicating the time and resources necessary to plan, record, and deliver a high-quality season of the Greenpill Podcast. With the support of their networks and the flexibility to allocate their time effectively, they can produce ten episodes within the proposed timeline, covering various topics related to Web3 grants and featuring insights from a diverse group of thought leaders and experts.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Assurance and Relevance</strong></p>
<p>To ensure the quality and relevance of each episode, the hosts will leverage their extensive knowledge of the Web3 grants space, tap into their networks of experts and thought leaders, and continuously monitor the latest developments and trends in the ecosystem. By connecting closely to the community‚Äôs pulse and engaging with the Greenpill audience, the hosts will strive to deliver timely, informative, and actionable content, providing listeners with a comprehensive understanding of the grant landscape and the tools to navigate it effectively.</p>

natesuits

            <p>Thank you for the opportunity for allowing the community to submit these proposals <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a>!</p>
<p>I‚Äôm proposing the following Season:</p>
<p><strong>Season Title</strong><br>
Token Engineering the Commons</p>
<p><strong>Season Goals</strong><br>
The goal of this season is to educate the GreenPill community on some of the Token Engineering concepts, mechanisms and processes that are enabling the creation of local commons. It will highlight some of the organizations and projects that are building the tools that will be used to enable local coordination, and to talk to the many organizations and individuals that are already experimenting in real communities all over the world.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this relevant to the greenpill audience in H2 2024?</strong><br>
The GreenPill audience has enjoyed exploring some of the broader solutions that blockchain technologies are attempting to solve.  During this season, we will dive deep into the application of Web3 technology and how it is actually being applied in the context of a real-world Commons, what challenges we still have yet to overcome, and how local communities can begin to apply some of these Token Engineering principles into their own environments.</p>
<p><strong>Timeline</strong><br>
Depending on scheduling and availability, I would like to begin this season in the middle/end of July and wrap up the season at some time near the end of the year (November/December).</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Episodes &amp; Guests</strong><br>
The proposed episodes and guests listed here are separated into two sections. The first half of the season would be dedicated to setting the context for exploring the Commons in the 21st Century through the lens of Token Engineering. The second half is dedicated to exploring the real world experiments already in progress and laying a blueprint for how others in the GreenPill network can implement their grassroot efforts.</p>

<p><strong>Are you a known quantity to the regen ecosystem? Links to previous work pls.</strong></p>
<p>I‚Äôve engaged with many regen ecosystem participants and projects through my work in the TEC and the Gitcoin Grant rounds.</p>
<p><strong>What‚Äôs your favorite greenpill episode + why?</strong></p>
<p>I really enjoyed the 3 part series with Daniel Schmachtenberger covering the metacrisis.  I particularly enjoyed part 2 on Superstructures and his insights into conflict theory and its application to design.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have time to record 5-15 episodes in the next couple quarters?</strong></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><strong>How will you ensure the episode is quality + relevant to the audience?</strong></p>
<p>Generally, I prepare each episode with a narrative in mind that is backed by research of the topic and the speaker involved.  In a shared document, I establish the goals of the discussion and provide each speaker with a general outline of the proposed talk and allow them to modify the content, questions, and format to help create a narrative of their work that aligns with the goals of the discussion.</p>
<p>This collaborative process has worked very well in the past as it allows each of us to be better prepared for the recording of the episode.  At the end of the day, I want to enable honest conversations and allow for the speakers to express their viewpoints without influence or prompting.</p>
<p>Thanks again!  Looking forward to see how the GreenPill Podcast evolves!</p>

<p>Onchain Grants Deep Dive (working title)</p>

<li>Arbitrum is currently running 5 different grants programs (sometimes overlapping)</li>
<li>Octant just wrapped its 4th iteration of running a massive experiment, using proceeds from 100,000 staked ETH in an attempt to sustainably fund digital public goods</li>
<li>In March, Filecoin announced a new $1M Retro Funding grants program</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Episodes would be recorded in June/July and debuted in August.</p>

Possible guests: Cheeky and/or Trent from Protocol Guild, Someone from OP re: Retro Funding, Kevin Owocki from Gitcoin, other capital allocation strategists (Vitalik, Glen, etc.)</li>

<p><strong>Do you have podcast hosting experience? Links to previous work pls.</strong></p>
<p>I‚Äôve hosted several podcasts and have appeared as a guest on over 100 podcasts.</p>
<p>As a podcast host:<br>
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0WQA3HTvkNbVmSSMPqLOdZ">The Leadership Gap</a><br>
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/4kuQqoQGE69LlrgwLo0gLK">The Gitcoin Pulse</a></p>
<p><strong>Are you a known quantity to the regen ecosystem? Links to previous work pls.</strong></p>
<p>I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm particularly known outside of IRL experiences, though I‚Äôve had the privilege of working at Gitcoin for the last 2-1/2 years and primarily participating in the Regen space through that. I‚Äôve also been a part of the Schelling Point planning team since April 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Whats your favorite greenpill episode + why?</strong></p>
<p>Any episode with Daniel Schmachtenberger, obviously. And anyone who hasn‚Äôt/doesn‚Äôt put this as their answer has obviously not listened to these episodes yet <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=12" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p><strong>Do you have time to record 5-15 episodes in the next couple quarters?</strong></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><strong>How will you ensure the episode is quality + relevant to the audience?</strong></p>
<p>I personally have a professional recording setup at home. I also have extensive podcasting experience and am familiar with the idea of keeping the audience top of mind. Ideally I‚Äôd be able to get a pulse on the relevance of the content based on the performance of the episodes compared to previous episodes.</p>

            <p>This is a great opportunity and thanks for sharing it with all of us <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a><br>
I along with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/launamu">@LauNaMu</a> would like to propose a season we are excited to host!</p>
<p><strong>Season Title</strong>: Summer of RetroRounds<br>
<strong>Season Goals</strong>: Our primary objective is to delve into the intricacies of Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) and examine its multifaceted phases and potential designs. This exploration will enable our listeners to gain a comprehensive understanding of how RPGF rounds are designed and the nuances involved in their execution.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this relevant to the greenpill audience in H2 2024?</strong><br>
RPGF is one of the most innovative mechanisms in the Public Goods Space now, a lot of the audience of Greenpill podcast has been involved directly or indirectly in the implementation of this mechanism and it‚Äôs different designs, hence it would be relevant to explore the design space of retro rounds in depth and the outcomes they have led to.</p>
<p><strong>Timeline</strong><br>
The first cohort of Ezrpgf concludes in June 2024. We aim to schedule our podcast episodes for July, providing a timely reflection on the outcomes of Cohort 1, great synergies with programming during EthCC, and set the space for the second cohort of Ezrpgf. This will also serve as an ideal platform to discuss potential innovations and improvements for future rounds. However we are flexible with the schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Episodes + Guests</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Setting the stage: This episode sets the stage for the season in which we discuss the development of the Cohort training sessions followed by pilot cohort, learnings and open the forum to the Study cases of the first Cohort.</li>
<li>Round 1 of FILRPGF: A discussion with the Filecoin team, including Tom and Kiran.</li>
<li>Exploring Round 1 with POKT: An episode dedicated to understanding the unique aspects and results of collaborating with POKT.</li>
<li>Retro Funding Rounds 4 and 5: Featuring RFP builders, this episode will explore the builds. For eg: 1.the West team on their development of the platform for rounds 3 + 4 and 2. MACI team on taking a privacy spin at ezRPGF</li>
<li>Innovation Opportunities: A session with Jonas to jam on uncharted areas within RF that could benefit from innovative approaches.</li>
<li>Future of RetroFunding: Evaluating the role of committees or citizen involvement in upcoming Retro rounds with Optimism (OP), forecasting the evolution of community engagement.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Do you have podcast hosting experience? Links to previous work pls.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we have some experience in hosting as well as being guests in some of the podcasts</p>

<p><strong>What‚Äôs your favorite greenpill episode + why?</strong><br>
Sejal : My personal favorite episode of the Greenpill podcast is undoubtedly the one I had the pleasure of hosting with Minister Audrey Tang. This episode stands out for me because of its unique focus on the innovative work being done in Taiwan. The discussions in this episode provided a deep and clear understanding of the local initiatives, making it super informative.</p>
<p>LauNaMu: My favorite episode of the Greenpill podcast is Dangerous Protocols with Nadia Asparouhva because of the analysis she shared on the duality of qualities protocols can have and the importance of keeping underlying implicit protocols in mind when designing visible and explicit protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have time to record 5-15 episodes in the next couple quarters?</strong><br>
Yes we have.</p>
<p><strong>How will you ensure the episode is quality + relevant to the audience?</strong><br>
The quality of each episode will be anchored in thorough research, the caliber of our guests, and the depth of the questions we pose. Our active involvement in the domain of retroactive public goods funding ensures that we are well-positioned to maintain high content standards.</p>

            <p><em>TLDR - I am going to step away from the Greenpill Podcast in Q3/Q4 2024 + am looking for ppl to guest cohost during that time.</em></p>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>For those of you who are unaware, I have been hosting the <a href="https://greenpill.network/">Greenpill Podcast</a> for the last 2 years. This podcast has been a way I can democratize my context + access to the rest of the ecosystem, research in public, vision-cast, and generally just explore the frontiers of regen web3.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve produced nearly 200 episodes and have had 300k+ listens, as well as about ~2k subscribers. I‚Äôm very proud of the content we‚Äôve created and the role Greenpill has played in supporting the regen movement.</p>
<p>But I think it is time to evolve it forward.</p>
<p>I am considering decentralizing my hosting duties for seasons 5, 6, and 7 to guest co-hosts who can go deep on a handful of different target niches.</p>
<p>Why do this?</p>
<ol>
<li>I am busy with Gitcoin stuff and dont have cycles to do another season of GP (and do it well) with my current workload.</li>
<li>Decentralizing the workload (and the spotlight) to other leaders in the GP community.</li>
<li>Enabling people to go deep in areas where I dont have access.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some topics I would love to see covered in season 4,5,6:</p>
<ol>
<li>Commons in the 21st century</li>
<li>ReStaking Ecosystem &lt;&gt; Regen Ecosystems</li>
<li>Regen Network States</li>
<li>Weird/Fun Fundraising Experiments</li>
<li>Crypto in the Global South</li>
<li>What am I missing?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are interested in being a host of a season, please submit a proposal via comment below.</p>
<p>Risks</p>
<ol>
<li>Need to keep content quality high.</li>
<li>The audience knows kevin, need to transfer rapport to new hosts.</li>
</ol>
<p>Things I would want to see in a proposal to be credible.</p>
<ul>
<li>Season Title</li>
<li>Season Goals</li>
<li>Why is this relevant to the greenpill audience in H2 2024?</li>
<li>Timeline</li>
<li>Proposed Episodes + Guests</li>
