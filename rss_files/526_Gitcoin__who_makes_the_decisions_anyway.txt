https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-who-makes-the-decisions-anyway/14537
    As Gitcoin races to deliver the "[three most important things](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s17-musing-gitcoins-most-important-thing/12875)" we recognize 1) the organization *has* changed and 2) we should proactively think about the next phase. For context, @Viriya shared some early thinking on what the future organization could look like. That conversation can be seen shared here with the Steward Council found [here](https://www.youtube.com/live/zwrQpyzc5pM?feature=share&t=1099).

> ‚ÄúEvery system is perfectly designed to get the results it gets.‚Äù **W.** **Edwards Deming**

One approach to the traditional organizational design is defining what decisions need to be made and who is best positioned to make those decisions. In the DAO this is doubly important as it is often not clear 1) what decision must be made 2) who has the right to make the decision and 3) who drives a decision to resolution? Adding complexity, central to DAO governance is the ethos of community input - how do we ensure we have the right level of involvement/input from stakeholders.

This was illustrated in March where we did an exercise to identify the Gitcoin governance pain points. According to CSDO, listed below are the five pain points, and as you might expect, the majority of the governance issues identified by DAO leadership were related to clarifying the decision space. In fact, the only pain point that was tangentially related to defining the decision space was with finding a way to grant better context to our Gitcoin Stewards ‚Äì so they can help the DAO make better decisions.

**Approval matrix and DACI ‚Äì the platform for change**

Using a collection of high context contributors, we were able to list out the potential sticky decisions that need to be made on an ongoing basis at Gitcoin. From there, we grouped those decisions into about six domains which loosely map to traditional functions. These domains are listed on the left column on the left in the diagram below, and the [Miro board here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMdVUuWM=/?share_link_id=668530058573). Being frugal, we decided to focus on Strategy, Organizational Design, Finance and Governance. Ongoing operations will require a bit more work and protocol operations is a container we expect to build on as we move beyond the Beta rounds.

Adding to the matrix, we identified five ‚Äúgroups‚Äù who made regular decisions for the DAO. From left to right across the top, they are GTC tokenholders/Stewards, CSDO, the Gitcoin Foundation, the Steward Council, and workstreams/workstream leaders. Finally, there are some decisions where the approver is not well defined, or we have not had to make a decision yet. We collected those gaps under ‚Äúundefined‚Äù.

Through a series of investigations and iterations, CSDO was able to agree on who was the ‚Äúapprover‚Äù of each of the most important decisions being made within the DAO.

> **‚ÄúOptimal governance reduces friction within the organization, increasing impact and productivity.‚Äù** Simone & Malcom Collins

Going further, we then used the standard [DACI model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MDtog-DXVJutoxC6TYXKoeGXwumtxMOtc1zGzG861kI/edit?usp=sharing) (Driver, Approver, Consulted, Informed) so that we can show the lifecycle of how the decision gets from identification to approval.

The importance of this step is key. While the **approver** might make the actual decision, the **driver** often frames the decision to be made and shoulders the burden of the work. To note, the driver can often delegate this work to a person or a sub team. Examples of this could include CSDO delegating work to a sub team. The sub team may do the work, but under the sponsorship and direction of CSDO.

![Picture0505|690x290](upload://m6OluxmXnwWcRTXsrT6XMu2vPza.jpeg)

Additionally, the [DACI chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MDtog-DXVJutoxC6TYXKoeGXwumtxMOtc1zGzG861kI/edit?usp=sharing) defines the relationship between the decision to be made and other stakeholders, who should be **consulted** or **informed** once a decision has been reached. We spent less time on these components knowing the hard work was defining the driver and the approver, but as we mature as an organization, solidifying these relationships is part of operational excellence.

Stewards and contributors can use this chart to understand 1) who makes what decision 2) who drives the decision to conclusion and to 3) identify critical decisions which are problematic or need to be defined.

Additionally, we can use the [Approval Matrix](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMdVUuWM=/?share_link_id=103069701518) to identify hot spots that might need a second look. Going back to the left hand column titled ‚Äúundefined‚Äù, we find items like DAO budgeting, oversight of the Gitcoin Foundation, tokenomics, CSDO representation, and hiring / offboarding of workstream leaders, this all could use additional definition. 

To identify other hotspots, we should look at each decision and ask:
* Do we have the right group making the right decisions?
* Can we improve performance if we adjust the decision-making structure?
* How does the decision architecture change as we launch Allo, Grants Stack and Passport?

Absent a decision making crisis, this unsexy & preventative work is never likely going to be described as ‚Äúwow‚Äù but it makes our decision architecture transparent, it help us plan organizational structure changes, it can help us avoid a crisis, and it can chart progress towards decentralization.

But, working these kinds of issues are difficult, sticky, and getting to an equitable resolution requires time and a kind of doggedness. So, I would love input from **contributors** and **stewards**. 

My open questions are:
1. Are there any ‚Äúapprovers‚Äù on this list that should be changed / challenged?
2. How urgent / important is this work to tackle now?
3. How might this work help us?

I have my own ideas on the hotspots, which you can find [here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMdVUuWM=/?share_link_id=540408295731) ‚Äì but I am interested to hear from stewards and the community as to the decision points you think need to be tackled next ‚Äì and the urgency of that work. Let us know your thoughts on the three questions above.

            <p>Thanks for your response here. How wonderful that you are giving back to your community - please know that I was just using this as an example - and the amounts are low. But when you see<br>
funds transferred from ProjectXYZ to StewardXYZ<br>
( <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x594dc03ce5184017a35ab6433e46cf97e8d7baa167ef96ae5be5ed4260b4fc70" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Ethereum Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | Etherscan</a> )<br>
and then<br>
funds transferred from StewardXYZ to ProjectXYZ<br>
( <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5049a5f4f9cc8a5026266d6192ec01b26a79e7c113bd5439a470152ed5aa8f06" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Ethereum Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | Etherscan</a> )<br>
It does appear slight askew.</p>
<p>Like I said though, the amount of these transactions is not high -  In fact minuscule if you compare it transactions back and forth, that‚Äôs not even factoring in the 2nd ERC-20 token that get sent out with every stable coin tx  ( example: <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0be18e6c2265a76019fe8b602535fc001c27b507428da9db831a008d36d4efa6" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Ethereum Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | Etherscan</a> )<br>

I think there are two questions at issue here.  One is voting on snapshot / tally on Gitcoin Governance proposals, the other is making donations/contributing/voting via the Gitcoin Grants rounds. 
For stewards voting on Gitcoin proposals with a COI, Gitcoin does have a policy prohibiting this activity and you can find it here  <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-dao-governance-process-v3/10358" class="inline-onebox">Gitcoin DAO Governance Process v3</a>).

</aside>
<p>Wow. Great question.  The work described above focused on strategy, org design, finance, and governance.  We spent less time on ongoing operations and very little time on protocol operations, which is where this kind of decision might fall in relation to grant execution and the COI (conflict of interest).</p>
<p>But the COI is often not well understood.  In Roberts Rules of Order (my go to for classic governance questions) the COI guidance is:<br>
‚ÄúNo member <strong>should</strong> vote on a question in which he has a direct personal or pecuniary interest not common to other members of the organization‚Äù</p>
<p>But, it clarified that:<br>
‚Äúno member <strong>can be compelled to refrain</strong> from voting in such circumstances‚Äù (RONR pg. 407, ll. 22-31).</p>
<p>Unless:<br>
Organizational guidance prohibits participation.</p>
<p>Other bodies expand this to include ‚Äúthe perception of a COI‚Äù given that is often as damaging as an actual COI.  At the DAO governance layer, Gitcoin prohibits participation in DAO governance votes where there is a COI. You can see that here <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-dao-governance-process-v3/10358" class="inline-onebox">Gitcoin DAO Governance Process v3</a>.  This document is however limited to DAO governance, not protocol or grant governance.</p>
<p>For protocol governance, I think I know the answer, but will ping <span class="mention">@benwest</span> for guidance.</p>

<p>One approach to the traditional organizational design is defining what decisions need to be made and who is best positioned to make those decisions. In the DAO this is doubly important as it is often not clear 1) what decision must be made 2) who has the right to make the decision and 3) who drives a decision to resolution? Adding complexity, central to DAO governance is the ethos of community input - how do we ensure we have the right level of involvement/input from stakeholders.</p>
<p>This was illustrated in March where we did an exercise to identify the Gitcoin governance pain points. According to CSDO, listed below are the five pain points, and as you might expect, the majority of the governance issues identified by DAO leadership were related to clarifying the decision space. In fact, the only pain point that was tangentially related to defining the decision space was with finding a way to grant better context to our Gitcoin Stewards ‚Äì so they can help the DAO make better decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Approval matrix and DACI ‚Äì the platform for change</strong></p>
<p>Using a collection of high context contributors, we were able to list out the potential sticky decisions that need to be made on an ongoing basis at Gitcoin. From there, we grouped those decisions into about six domains which loosely map to traditional functions. These domains are listed on the left column on the left in the diagram below, and the <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMdVUuWM=/?share_link_id=668530058573" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Miro board here</a>. Being frugal, we decided to focus on Strategy, Organizational Design, Finance and Governance. Ongoing operations will require a bit more work and protocol operations is a container we expect to build on as we move beyond the Beta rounds.</p>
<p>Adding to the matrix, we identified five ‚Äúgroups‚Äù who made regular decisions for the DAO. From left to right across the top, they are GTC tokenholders/Stewards, CSDO, the Gitcoin Foundation, the Steward Council, and workstreams/workstream leaders. Finally, there are some decisions where the approver is not well defined, or we have not had to make a decision yet. We collected those gaps under ‚Äúundefined‚Äù.</p>
<p>Through a series of investigations and iterations, CSDO was able to agree on who was the ‚Äúapprover‚Äù of each of the most important decisions being made within the DAO.<br>

<p>Going further, we then used the standard <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MDtog-DXVJutoxC6TYXKoeGXwumtxMOtc1zGzG861kI/edit?usp=sharing" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">DACI model</a> (Driver, Approver, Consulted, Informed) so that we can show the lifecycle of how the decision gets from identification to approval.</p>
<p>The importance of this step is key. While the <strong>approver</strong> might make the actual decision, the <strong>driver</strong> often frames the decision to be made and shoulders the burden of the work. To note, the driver can often delegate this work to a person or a sub team. Examples of this could include CSDO delegating work to a sub team. The sub team may do the work, but under the sponsorship and direction of CSDO.</p>

<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MDtog-DXVJutoxC6TYXKoeGXwumtxMOtc1zGzG861kI/edit?usp=sharing" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">DACI chart</a> defines the relationship between the decision to be made and other stakeholders, who should be <strong>consulted</strong> or <strong>informed</strong> once a decision has been reached. We spent less time on these components knowing the hard work was defining the driver and the approver, but as we mature as an organization, solidifying these relationships is part of operational excellence.</p>
<p>Stewards and contributors can use this chart to understand 1) who makes what decision 2) who drives the decision to conclusion and to 3) identify critical decisions which are problematic or need to be defined.</p>
<p>Additionally, we can use the <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMdVUuWM=/?share_link_id=103069701518" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Approval Matrix</a> to identify hot spots that might need a second look. Going back to the left hand column titled ‚Äúundefined‚Äù, we find items like DAO budgeting, oversight of the Gitcoin Foundation, tokenomics, CSDO representation, and hiring / offboarding of workstream leaders, this all could use additional definition.</p>
<p>To identify other hotspots, we should look at each decision and ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we have the right group making the right decisions?</li>
<li>Can we improve performance if we adjust the decision-making structure?</li>
<li>How does the decision architecture change as we launch Allo, Grants Stack and Passport?</li>
</ul>
<p>Absent a decision making crisis, this unsexy &amp; preventative work is never likely going to be described as ‚Äúwow‚Äù but it makes our decision architecture transparent, it help us plan organizational structure changes, it can help us avoid a crisis, and it can chart progress towards decentralization.</p>
<p>But, working these kinds of issues are difficult, sticky, and getting to an equitable resolution requires time and a kind of doggedness. So, I would love input from <strong>contributors</strong> and <strong>stewards</strong>.</p>
<p>My open questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are there any ‚Äúapprovers‚Äù on this list that should be changed / challenged?</li>
<li>How urgent / important is this work to tackle now?</li>
<li>How might this work help us?</li>
</ol>
<p>I have my own ideas on the hotspots, which you can find <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMdVUuWM=/?share_link_id=540408295731" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a> ‚Äì but I am interested to hear from stewards and the community as to the decision points you think need to be tackled next ‚Äì and the urgency of that work. Let us know your thoughts on the three questions above.</p>
