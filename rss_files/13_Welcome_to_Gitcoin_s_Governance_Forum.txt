    Gitcoin is on a mission to create technologies and opportunities that enable communities to build, fund and protect what matters. Our governance forum is home to where ideas around the current and future direction of the DAO get discussed, proposed, voted on and ratified.

## Getting Started

* [Code of Conduct](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/about-gitcoin/code-of-conduct) - Understand what behavior we do/nâ€™t tolerate in our forums

## Keeping informed

There are several ways to keep informed, including:

* DAO Digest - bi-weekly update on all things Gitcoin ([Click here to have these updates delivered to you via email](https://share.hsforms.com/1qr4-szfGQAmHKqItMstzoAd0r2h))
