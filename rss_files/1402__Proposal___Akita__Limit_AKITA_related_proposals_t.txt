[Proposal - Akita] Limit AKITA related proposals to allow new ideas to be proposed
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-akita-limit-akita-related-proposals-to-allow-new-ideas-to-be-proposed/4461
    Hi, I'm a new user of Gitcoin and I been noticing that most of the proposals are AKITA related. I think that this formation of proposals are blocking other non-related ideas to be evaluated. It almost seems like the AKITA community is trying to take control of the platform and I don't think its fair. I'm a Binance Smart Chain enthusiast and I'm not really sure if I'm allowed to make more than one proposal related to BSC but for the sake of the Gitcoin community I limited my proposal related to BSC to just one which I think the AKITA community should also abide to :man_shrugging: .

            <p>Yeah I agree there needs to be some kind of moderation, maybe an AKITA exclusive channel and the rest of AKITA posts should be filtered out.</p>
