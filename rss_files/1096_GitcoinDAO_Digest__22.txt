Without further ado, let‚Äôs dive in!

## [ü§ñ Meta-Governance](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/governance-meta/6)

* [Nader](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/dabit3) published a proposal for a [Partnership & Mutual Grant with Developer DAO](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-partnership-mutual-grant-with-developer-dao/9217). ‚ÄúThe proposal, if passed, would issue 50,000 GTC for governance rights equating to 5% of Developer DAO when governance is live. The purpose of this alliance is to help ensure that Gitcoin and Developer DAO can work together to coordinate bringing more web2 developers into web3 than ever before through education and events, as well as supporting the creation and distribution of public goods.‚Äù

* [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki) authored a thread titled [Coordination.Party Kit](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/coordination-party-kit/9231) that describes the Coordination Party Kit that[ Moonshot Collective](https://moonshotcollective.space/) is working on and aiming to launch in February at[ Schelling Point](http://schellingpoint.gitcoin.co/). The Kit is a ‚Äútool suite that helps recruit, recognize, reward, and retain contributors to DAOs.‚Äù If you would like to try out the CPKP in your own DAO, please join the[ coordination.party 2/17 launch Telegram group

* [A Community Based Roadmap for Sybil Detection Across Web 3 ](https://gitcoin.co/blog/a-community-based-roadmap-for-sybil-detection-across-web-3/)by [Joe](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/DisruptionJoe) describes the problems of sybil attacks on the Gitcoin platform and how the FDD-workstream works towards solving these problems. The post ends with an exploration of the possibility of a ‚ÄúA Sybil Detection DAO‚Äù with collaboration between DAOs to combat attacks.

## [üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Workstream Discussion](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/workstream-discussion/9)

### üå± [Public Goods Funding](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Public-Goods-Funding-80a3202a3a244c65b3fda08c0f7c7d60)

* [Grants Round 12](https://gitcoin.co/blog/announcing-grants-round-12/) goes live this week, with over $2m in matching pool funding from a variety of ecosystem partners like ENS, Ethereum Foundation, and NounsDAO

* [NounsDAO](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-a-very-nounish-gitcoinmas-nft-crossover-event-169-eth-to-crypto-public-goods/369) in particular has committed one of the largest single amounts of funding ever at 169 ETH, with a special NounsBot auction set to happen later this week

* Moreover, PGF successfully set up [over 10 rounds in total for GR12](https://gitcoin.co/blog/announcing-grants-round-12/), including three cause rounds focusing on advocacy, climate, and longevity

* The public library and public goods PR squads continue to push forward on helping promote and expand the discourse around public goods; Aya from the Ethereum Foundation and a number of other exciting speakers are coming up!

* We‚Äôve continued to solidify partnerships with groups like DeveloperDAO, Verses, and more.

### [üöÄ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-prototyping-workstream-moonshot-budget-request-q4-2021/8785) [Moonshot Collective](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Moonshot-Collective-ffa78f44a0de412cb607f9b69d3a376f)

* [The GreatestLARP](https://greatestlarp.com/final-battle), a multi-level coordination game to fund public goods is down to the final level and we need you! Join us on Dec 6 for the kick-off party where we‚Äôll come together to beat The Final Boss. [Save the date here](https://www.addevent.com/event/Qu10410679)!

* The GreatestLARP has already raised approximately $400K for public goods, with the opportunity to raise hundreds of thousands more.

* How does it work? We must crowdfund 50 ETH to unlock Level 4‚Äôs final battle between Moloch and our ETHBot hero, enshrined as a 1:1 NFT. All proceeds fund public goods, but not only that: crowdfund participants own a portion of the NFT, based on how much they contribute. Let‚Äôs coordinate to take down Moloch!

### üåê [Decentralize Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Decentralize-Gitcoin-c3197f918bf640bc9809cd26d56c93f3)

* Final bug fixes being pushed out in preparation for Grants Round 12 start.

* ‚ÄòMy Grants‚Äô feature is done and merged, ‚ÄòMy Contributions‚Äô final review and will be merged soon.

* The ‚ÄòGitcoin Building Gitcoin‚Äô grant round has been deployed to Polygon.

* Grants are being created for the round on the dGrants production instance.

* Working on an improved support process and grant review/approval process.

### üíô [Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Fraud-Detection-Defense-f1a2969a9f324f57a02ef69a60b25cae)

* The Sybil Detection pipeline presents a novel way for participatory self-governance for user-driven content moderation. Solving sybil-resistance and exporting it to any dapp developer will unlock quadratic voting and staking mechanisms across web 3.

* Omnianalytics presented on an FDD contributor access management framework. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve thrown a diverse group of highly motivated people onto an island with plenty of food, water, and raw materials and given them the mandate to build a city. Considering their backgrounds, the landscape and various hidden constraints, how should they coordinate to get things done?‚Äù
  * We, the Anti-Sybil FDD team, are the castaways.
  * The resources are our smarts, motivation and the budget.
  * The landscape is the currently available technology stack.
  * The mandate is to build out a ML Anti-Sybil defense for the GitcoinDAO.
  * The city we‚Äôre building is that Machine Learning pipeline and process.
* Formal research on the motivation and profiling of sybil attackers began in the research initiative. Identifying the motivations behind these attacks will give us better insights into protecting quadratic funding.

* In Q3, FDD took the initiative to ensure that contributors got paid and that the DAO mitigated potential issues which could be avoided. Now the process of finding out where these streams are best situated is beginning to take shape. The unspent funds for DAOops in Q4 will be sent to the new CrossStream DAOops multisig

### üé® [Merch, Memes & Marketing](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Memes-Merch-Marketing-c1bd89fac8ab4569bf2a676df28025d8)

* [Memepalooza 4](https://www.addevent.com/event/ja10368883) will take place this upcoming Friday. The event is a 3-hour long meme creation-session with meme lords from the broader community joining forces to meme public goods, the open internet and the values of Gitcoin.

* Memes.party, a website to celebrate meme lords and great memes, was demoed earlier this week and is set to launch on Friday at Memepalooza 4. Participants of Memepalooza will be the first to test out the new tool.

* The [schwag bounty](https://gitcoin.co/issue/gitcoinco/creative/412/100026987) put up by the workstream ended last Friday. We had over 20 people submit designs. After much deliberation by the MMM design-substream, three winners were chosen and announced on Discord. [The 1st place winner](https://store.gitcoin.co/products/%F0%9F%9A%80-defiversal-hoodie) was awarded 500 DAI and the two with 100DAI to the two runners up. All items will be up in the [Gitcoin store](http://gitcoin.co/store) shortly.

<p>Omnianalytics presented on an FDD contributor access management framework. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve thrown a diverse group of highly motivated people onto an island with plenty of food, water, and raw materials and given them the mandate to build a city. Considering their backgrounds, the landscape and various hidden constraints, how should they coordinate to get things done?‚Äù</p>
<ul>
<li>We, the Anti-Sybil FDD team, are the castaways.</li>
<li>The resources are our smarts, motivation and the budget.</li>
<li>The landscape is the currently available technology stack.</li>
<li>The mandate is to build out a ML Anti-Sybil defense for the GitcoinDAO.</li>
<li>The city we‚Äôre building is that Machine Learning pipeline and process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formal research on the motivation and profiling of sybil attackers began in the research initiative. Identifying the motivations behind these attacks will give us better insights into protecting quadratic funding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Q3, FDD took the initiative to ensure that contributors got paid and that the DAO mitigated potential issues which could be avoided. Now the process of finding out where these streams are best situated is beginning to take shape. The unspent funds for DAOops in Q4 will be sent to the new CrossStream DAOops multisig</p>
