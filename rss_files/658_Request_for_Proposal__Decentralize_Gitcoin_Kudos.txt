Request for Proposal: Decentralize Gitcoin Kudos
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/request-for-proposal-decentralize-gitcoin-kudos/8115
    Hello DAOfrens, 

This is request for someone to come up with a new decentralized experience for managing Gitcoin.co/Kudos

As we progressively decentralize Gitcoin, the Gitcoin Holdings company is interested in decentralizing the Kudos experience from our [centralized codebase](https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/) to a decentralized frontend.

NOTE: Kudos is already a ERC-721-style NFT with a [smart contract](https://github.com/gitcoinco/Kudos721Contract), so the bones are already in place.

An ideal candidate would be have the following principles:
1. Simplicity - products that do ONE THING and do it WELL.
2. Antifragility - Well-documented Decentralized products that our community can run without the centralized company.
3. Modularity - products that easily unix-style interoperate with each other.

Gitcoin Holdings will provide a database backup of any centralized information (Kudos Images, metadata) needed to make a great Kudosexperience to a winning proposal.

Would any of you be interested in developing a decentralized Kudos? If so please submit a proposal by September 15th 2021.  

Use cases to include in the proposal:
1. view kudos on marketplace
2. send a kudos (xdai or mainnet)

Use cases that are NOT important for the first build out but could be built out later.
1. bulk airdrop of kudos
2. view who else holds a Kudos
3. indirect send of kudos
4. new kudos creation form

Please include

1. Who are you
2. What is your proposal to build this
3. What is your timeline to build this
4. What do you need (funding, etc)

Please submit your proposal as a comment on the gov forum thread.

            <p>Thank you <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/huxwell">@Huxwell</a> ! Apologies for the late response here! We would love to meet with the dCompass contributors as well - what would be the best course of action here? Shall we connect on Discord?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I didn‚Äôt find a Github link on your website. Can you confirm that the MVP will be open source ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes! Everything we build with Gitcoin will be fully open sourced and will take a community-centric approach to development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also saw that you are founder of the mintKudos project, is there already a legal entity established for it ? If so, do you already have investors or do you plan to get funded by VCs or other type of funding?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep, there is a legal entity behind the Mint Kudos project in the US. We are looking into multiple sources of funding, and happy to share more about it over a call.</p>

            <p>Thank you for this proposal which reflects a desire to collaborate with Gitcoin contributors!</p>
<p>The dCompass contributors would love to meet with your team and eventually work together.<br>
I‚Äôm sure that the product discovery, user interviews and design could also help us to find a product market fit.</p>
<p>I didn‚Äôt find a Github link on your website.<br>

<p>I also saw that you are founder of the mintKudos project, is there already a legal entity established for it ? If so, do you already have investors or do you plan to get funded by VCs or other type of funding?</p>
<p>We can schedule a meeting if you prefer to discuss those topics privately.</p>

            <p>Thanks so much <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/keikumata">@keikumata</a> for the proposal. I love the vision you (collectively) have for Kudos, and that you all are interested in advancing the project Gitcoin has had to put in maintenance mode.</p>
<p>I am interested in other‚Äôs opinions on the proposal, and I am highly supportive of us moving this forward and offering some space to form a workstream (like we did with dCompass).</p>
<p>As for next steps, perhaps we can have you meet with a few other folks to share the ideas you have and learn more about we develop software, gather feedback and iterate.</p>

</h1>
<p>We‚Äôd like to start with the goal of doing product discovery to ultimately build out a custom user experience that‚Äôs appropriate given common user journeys within the Gitcoin ecosystem. The solution we‚Äôre proposing would reuse our Soulbound smart contract and various UI experiences to prompt a Kudos creation (both manual and automatic) upon things like bounty completion, quest completion, hackathon participation, and even grant contributions. We would also like to rebuild the Gitcoin profile view as well.</p>
<p>The key here is that any Kudos you receive in Gitcoin should be presentable as part of your decentralized reputation in any context outside of Gitcoin. The non-transferability of the Kudos is a big plus when building proper decentralized reputation that shouldn‚Äôt be traded or bought. By leveraging the smart contracts and our platform, this should be a win-win situation for everyone. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=12" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <h3>
<a name="who-are-you-1" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#who-are-you-1"></a>Who Are You</h3>
<p>Heyo <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a> and fellow Gitcoiners! I‚Äôm Paul Gadi, co-founder and CTO at <a href="https://opgames.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">OPGames</a>. We‚Äôre bridging game developers to Web 3.0 by building the open-source tools to make it as simple as possible for them to start integrating with the blockchain.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre calling these tools <a href="https://youtu.be/9EF_hrmVMqM?t=224" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Game Legos</a>: in the same way that Money Legos was able to bring about the DeFi renaissance, we feel these Game Legos will be instrumental in bringing about the coming NFT Game revolution.</p>
<p>Game Legos are also perfectly in sync with the goals of this RFP. We‚Äôre building them open-source and as simple, robust, and composable as we can.</p>
<h3>
<a name="what-is-your-proposal-to-build-this-2" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#what-is-your-proposal-to-build-this-2"></a>What Is Your Proposal to Build This</h3>
<p>Same as our <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/request-for-proposal-decentralized-gitcoin-avatar-builder/8117">PFP proposal</a>, we believe this should be built as a Game Lego on top of <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/austingriffith">@austingriffith</a>‚Äôs scaffold-eth. We believe Scaffold-eth is not only the framework with the most solid foundation but is also the fastest way for developers to get started in Web 3.0. It also has a strong community of builders behind it that we could tap to continue improving the project.</p>
<p>To increase antifragility and modularity we‚Äôre considering building the Kudos on top of <a href="https://rarible.medium.com/introducing-the-rarible-protocol-an-open-source-cross-chain-tool-for-nft-innovation-318f7c7fb4f0" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Rarible‚Äôs new open-source and cross-chain protocol</a>.</p>
<h3>
<a name="what-is-your-timeline-to-build-this-3" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#what-is-your-timeline-to-build-this-3"></a>What Is Your Timeline To Build This</h3>
<p>The first version will focus only on the marketplace integration and minting + sending kudos.</p>
<p>First step would be to create the new smart contracts on the Rarible protocol. Next would be to test and migrate some of the current kudos to a testnet, perhaps redeploy the assets into decentralized storage, and then make sure they appear on all the supported marketplaces. Finally we can then create a sample UI on scaffold-eth for minting kudos and sending them to other wallets.</p>
<p>An estimate would be about 1 month, barring any smart contract compatibility issues.</p>
<h4>
<a name="enhancing-the-kudos-experience-4" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#enhancing-the-kudos-experience-4"></a>Enhancing the Kudos Experience</h4>
<p>We also have some ideas on how to improve adoption of Kudos which also address the future use cases.</p>
<ol>
<li>Minting scripts should be created for not just xDAI but also other layer 2s to give minters the lowest cost options possible.</li>
<li>An open-source widget should be created to allow builders to easily integrate Kudos into their games or apps, something similar to <a href="https://docs.opensea.io/docs/11-embedding-your-storefront-in-your-own-site" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Opensea‚Äôs Embed Collection Feature</a>.</li>
<li>We should also take a look at non Web-3 projects that have broad usage of kudos-like functionality, such as Reddit and Steam Awards, and create code to allow builders to quickly do this.</li>

<p>Perhaps something to allow us to give out Kudos here on Discourse? Example steam award below:</p>

Request for Proposal: Decentralize Gitcoin Kudos
owocki

            <p>Hello DAOfrens,</p>
<p>This is request for someone to come up with a new decentralized experience for managing <a href="http://Gitcoin.co/Kudos" class="inline-onebox">@kudos | Gitcoin</a></p>
<p>As we progressively decentralize Gitcoin, the Gitcoin Holdings company is interested in decentralizing the Kudos experience from our <a href="https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/">centralized codebase</a> to a decentralized frontend.</p>
<p>NOTE: Kudos is already a ERC-721-style NFT with a <a href="https://github.com/gitcoinco/Kudos721Contract">smart contract</a>, so the bones are already in place.</p>
<p>An ideal candidate would be have the following principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Simplicity - products that do ONE THING and do it WELL.</li>
<li>Antifragility - Well-documented Decentralized products that our community can run without the centralized company.</li>
<li>Modularity - products that easily unix-style interoperate with each other.</li>
</ol>
<p>Gitcoin Holdings will provide a database backup of any centralized information (Kudos Images, metadata) needed to make a great Kudosexperience to a winning proposal.</p>
<p>Would any of you be interested in developing a decentralized Kudos? If so please submit a proposal by September 15th 2021.</p>
<p>Use cases to include in the proposal:</p>
<ol>
<li>view kudos on marketplace</li>
<li>send a kudos (xdai or mainnet)</li>
</ol>
<p>Use cases that are NOT important for the first build out but could be built out later.</p>
<ol>
<li>bulk airdrop of kudos</li>
<li>view who else holds a Kudos</li>
<li>indirect send of kudos</li>
<li>new kudos creation form</li>
</ol>
<p>Please include</p>
<ol>
<li>Who are you</li>
<li>What is your proposal to build this</li>
<li>What is your timeline to build this</li>
<li>What do you need (funding, etc)</li>
</ol>
<p>Please submit your proposal as a comment on the gov forum thread.</p>
