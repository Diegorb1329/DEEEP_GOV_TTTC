    Hi all, 

I'm one of the team members at the Gitcoin core development company, [Kevin Owocki](twitter.com/owocki).

I was wondering what questions the community has for us.  Feel free to AMA.

            <p>Congrats on what you are doing <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a>. In the long term, what do you think the funding sources for incentivizing Open source development can be?</p>
<p>How about some sort of an alumi-donations from projects that get funded by Gitcoin DAO and gain success. Maybe some kind of voluntary equity model from those founders?? (Sorry if this sound more like an idea wrapped in a question, LOL)</p>

<p>curious about your vision for gitcoindao‚Ä¶</p>
</blockquote>
<p>basically the idea is for gitcoindao to be a schelling point for the hopeful; for those who want to build a vessel that can go to the quadratic lands - the promised land of digital democracy and public goods being funded.</p>
<p>tangibly that means creating a DAO of DAOs - a generator function (a function that generates other functions) that generates projects/DAOs/companies that fund public goods.</p>
<p>this is of course new framing of what we‚Äôve been doing for a very long time =&gt; <a href="http://gitcoin.co/results" class="inline-onebox">Impact Results | Gitcoin</a> . coordinating builders &amp; funders to build/fund the open web.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>more specifically what might the future look like for less experienced (not quite steward level) contributors? working groups? forum discussions and proposals? I‚Äôm sure there are a lot of people wanting to pitch in down the road<br>
the workstreams that i‚Äôve seen proposed from the community</p>

    Hey Gitcoiners, 
I suggest that we put together a Workstream around how to effectively manage the Gitcoin treasury. 
Using DeFi protocols we can extend the treasury‚Äôs capital and maximize the impact of public goods funding. 
We have some heavy hitters of the DeFi space who have stood up to be Stewards so I am confident we can put together a good strategy to effectively tackle this. 
This also happens to co-inside with some work we are doing at PleasrDAO.

Over the last few years, Gitcoin has been building solutions around how we fund the public goods we care about, most successfully using <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06421">quadratic funding</a>, a novel mechanism designed by Vitalik, Glen Weyl, and Zoe Hitzig in 2018. 
The way this mechanism works is simple, projects in Ethereum can list themselves as public goods in need of funding, and participants can democratically allocate funds from a community managed matching pool by donating some of their own money. By its design, q‚Ä¶
