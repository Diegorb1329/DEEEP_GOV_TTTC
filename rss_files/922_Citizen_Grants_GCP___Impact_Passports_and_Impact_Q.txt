    # Proposal Title

Baking Impact Into The Quadratic Funding Matching Formula (ImpactQF)

# Description

This proposal seeks funding to create an **Impact Passport framework**. We expect use of this passport to augment the Quadratic Funding mechanism, serve as training data for AI allocation agents, and other use cases as they arise.

Projects can collect passport stamps from a selection of Impact Evaluators to demonstrate the impact of their project. Examples of existing Impact Evaluators are Open Source Observer for software contributions, Karma GAP for output based evaluation, Metrics Garden for outcome based evaluation, or GainForest for climate projects.

The first application of impact passport that we would like to see is a new mechanism, Impact Quadratic Funding (ImpactQF), where we bake impact into the quadratic funding matching formula. Projects with a higher impact score will obtain a higher matching fund. Through these verified impact measurements, ImpactQF ensures that matching funds are efficiently allocated based on *outcomes* rather than a popularity contest.

We hope that Gitcoin will also integrate the Impact Passport and ImpactQF mechanism in its future funding rounds. Through this implementation, we aim to support Gitcoin in more efficient allocation of capital. It would also position Gitcoin as the centerstage for evaluation providers to be included as a stamp, similar to the role Gitcoin passport played for identity solutions.

# Motivation

*Based on the 2025 trends to watch by Gitcoin: https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/2025-trends-to-watch-gitcoin/19362*

‚ÄúGrants are not dying, but they are entering their Reputation era.‚Äù There is a rising demand for verifiable impact. We need to quickly capture this market segment of efficiently allocating ecosystem incentives to the most impactful projects.

Currently, Gitcoin primarily allocates funds based on Quadratic Funding, which does not have an impact metric baked into its formula. As more matching funds are allocated to projects that have the most ‚Äúvotes", projects that invest a considerable amount of time and resources in community outreach and marketing tend to capture more matching funds than those creating genuine impact. One potential downside of this formula is that projects may be incentivized to value promotion over delivering real value. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where funding is driven by community outreach rather than actual impact, ultimately incentivizing projects to prioritize promotion, or direct their funds into capturing more funds rather than doing work.

IQF addresses this by incorporating verified impact scores from specialized evaluators into the quadratic funding formula, creating an equitable mechanism that rewards actual outcomes across different domains of public goods.

It also positions Gitcoin as the central platform where every evaluator in the space tries to get included as a stamp.

* Positions Gitcoin as the central platform where every evaluator in the space tries to get included as a stamp

**Impact Quadratic Funding**

* Bakes in impact directly into the funding mechanism
* Allows donors or grant operators to measure the impact of their capital allocation
* Allocates ecosystem incentives to the most impactful projects

            <p>Appreciate the thought behind the proposal ‚Äì verifiable impact is a huge initiative for Gitcoin and for the grants space generally. Also love to see the collaboration with our friends/valued partners at OSO, Karma, Metrics Garden, etc.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll echo <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/sov">@Sov</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ccerv1">@ccerv1</a> 's comments around funding a brand-new initiative ‚Äì it‚Äôs generally safe/nice to invest in teams with some proven traction. I‚Äôm also having a hard time conceptualizing the user journey for projects who participate in this‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôs a little onerous? One way to address this could be the simulations <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ccerv1">@ccerv1</a> mentioned or even some mockups / wireframes.</p>
<p>One thought-starter for you all: how should QF donors think of their role in allocating funding with this algorithm in place? What do they add to the equation that is not accounted for in the impact algorithm? And if the impact measurement efforts are successful, could donors actually have a negative impact on allocations?</p>

<img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/question.png?v=12" title=":question:" class="emoji" alt=":question:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> Generally, I like to see teams come with a PoC or some traction <strong>first</strong> before getting funded (see my comments on <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gcp-xxx-community-knowledge-base-for-llm/19523">another recent GCP</a>). In this case, that could be accomplished via a simulation (mock data) or a very basic impact framework on a subset of historic project submissions.</p>
<p>If this moves to a vote, I would likely abstain given OSO is a (indirect) dependency, but will hereby register my support for this in principle</p>

            <p>I support exploring this Impact Passport framework, particularly its potential to shift funding allocation from pure marketing effectiveness to verified impact. The multi-evaluator approach using established tools like Open Source Observer and Karma GAP could provide valuable signals for decision-making.</p>
<p>Two suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Could you share a concrete mock-up showing how impact scores would be calculated and how the modified quadratic funding formula would work in practice?</li>
<li>Consider structuring as 50% upfront for infrastructure and 50% retroactive based on specific success metrics like number of projects onboarded and funding allocated through ImpactQF.</li>

<p>is there a component of this that will be built with smart contracts? most of the QF calcs are offchain, so wondering if we can reallocate this budget to something else.  personally i think marketing this mechanism and what makes it special would be a good use of funds.</p>
