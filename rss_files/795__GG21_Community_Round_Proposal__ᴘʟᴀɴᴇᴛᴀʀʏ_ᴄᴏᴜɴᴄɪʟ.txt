### Round History:

Right after the GG20 we run the round outside of the regular Gitcoin cycle. This is the only round done by the ·¥ò ü·¥Ä…¥·¥á·¥õ·¥Ä Ä è ·¥Ñ·¥è·¥ú…¥·¥Ñ…™ ü so far.  [Link to the explorer](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/63):

![image|576x500](upload://9YRTJb6qjrxTbOtX9EEIEOvQNXg.jpeg)

_(the numbers were rather unimpressive due to the "out of cycle" timing, even though initially we were thinking this can act to our advantage)_

Now we would like to double down and continue during the **`media-marketing-shilling-frenzy`** which is GG21 üòá

### Alignment with Gitcoin‚Äôs [Mission ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/update-gitcoins-adopted-mission-and-vision-statements/15039) and [Essential Intents ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/update-gitcoin-s-ratified-essential-intents-2023-2024-and-a-recap-of-our-successes/16818):

Powerful mission:

> * Gitcoin inspires a world shaped by community-led positive change
> * Gitcoin creates technologies and opportunities that enable communities to build, fund and protect what matters
> * Gitcoin exists to empower communities to fund their shared needs.

> * Network Effects
> * Community First
> * Financial Longevity

We are üíØüíØüíØ aligned with these. Well optimised. Wordsmith sorcery. 

In our operations we want to further leverage nework efforts + put community first + have financial longevity in mind as baseline to operate in the modern world.

We drive positive change through collaborative community effort, open-source from the ground-up, radical transparency as competitive advantage: less worry about OPSEC.

UN was created in 1945 after WW2... Now we have completely new set of challenges, that's why ·¥ò ü·¥Ä…¥·¥á·¥õ·¥Ä Ä è ·¥Ñ·¥è·¥ú…¥·¥Ñ…™ ü and  ·¥Ä·¥Ñ·¥õ…™·¥†·¥Ä·¥õ…™…¥…¢ …¥·¥á·¥° ·¥á·¥Ä Ä·¥õ ú ·¥è Ä·¥Ö·¥á Ä. We live in the revolutionary times:

### Anticipated Size of the Matching Pool:

Current status: 0.67 ETH 

Link to Etherscan: https://etherscan.io/address/0x476f2d18d28fa1a4fc62ce680fa7852524eb820f

Money coming from the sales of passports: [Network State Genesis]( https://genesis.re/)

![image|690x460](upload://v6yZKYuOVEsEa1KmTVflZFrm6du.jpeg)

Our plan is to dedicate all new sales of the passports towards the matching round.

Exact logistics of the sales plan: **TBD TBC WIP** 

### Advisors for This Round:

‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT CONFIRMED** ‚ö†Ô∏è
‚ö†Ô∏è **NICE TO HAVE** ‚ö†Ô∏è
‚ö†Ô∏è **IDEAL WORLD** ‚ö†Ô∏è

Reputable, trustworthy, experienced, knowledgeable, well-connected.

We had a number interactions across multiple channels but they are not informed yet about me asking them to become advisors.

* Wasabi: [@WasabiNetwork](https://x.com/WasabiNetwork)
* Pranav: [@checkfit](https://x.com/checkfit)
* Monty: [@MontyMerlin](https://x.com/MontyMerlin)
* Jimmy: [@jimicohen](https://x.com/jimicohen)
* Jon: [@jhruth](https://x.com/jhruth)
* Let's Grow DAO: [@LetsGROWdao](https://x.com/LetsGROWdao)

Asking for forgiveness, while retroacticely asking for permission: become ·¥ò ü·¥Ä…¥·¥á·¥õ·¥Ä Ä è ·¥Ñ·¥è·¥ú…¥·¥Ñ…™ ü advisors, please üòá

**EDIT / UPDATE:** the contact has been initiated but no official confirmation.

Potential additional list of advisors:
* Groucho Fractal: https://www.instagram.com/grouchofractal/
* Brandon: https://www.instagram.com/brandon.v.h/
* Members of United Planet *(an organisation aligned with ·¥ò ü·¥Ä…¥·¥á·¥õ·¥Ä Ä è ·¥Ñ·¥è·¥ú…¥·¥Ñ…™ ü)*
* Members of https://openexo.com/

As a thought experiment we would like to invite "red team" and anti-advisors from organisations with questionable ethics: 
* Koch family (funding climate denial)
* Sackler family (responsible for opioid epidemics)
* Petro states
* Military-industrial complex
* Bilderberg Group

Reason logic rationale: our main objective is system change. Some entities that benefit from the current toxic system might be against revolutionary policies. ***"keep your friends close and your enemies closer"*** - we would like to work together and find a path forward that is serving entire humanity, that's why in our work we need to address concerns coming from all areas of the political spectrum.

### Funding Mechanism:

At the moment of writing: not set in stone. Depending whether we will become TOP5 and receive matching. **EDIT / UPDATE:** Most likely QF with some adjustments / experiments.

**Experiment 1Ô∏è‚É£:** "Winners decide",  top 20% of the projects distribute 20% of the allocated funds. Detailed description and rationale here: https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/beyond-qf-quadratic-funding-comments-suggestions-ideas/18875

**Experiment 2Ô∏è‚É£:** We intend to introduce `minimal funding cut-off` to ensure funds are prioritised wisely. It behaves symmetrical to funding cap. 

Previously, to ensure projects receive a sizeable amount, the selection was done at the application phase. We don't want to act as gatekeepers. We want to encourage participation. 

Source: [Observations from Ma Earth‚Äôs first quadratic funding round](https://paragraph.xyz/@maearth/quadratic-funding-observations-from-grants-round-1)
> In our research of others rounds, we repeatedly heard the complaint from projects that they received such small matching amounts in the end, it wasn‚Äôt necessarily worth the time involved in promoting it to their communities. That‚Äôs why we decided to go with 23 grantees, from a pool of ~50 qualified applicants. We wanted to ensure that once the $100,000 was divided up, it would still be meaningful for each project relative to their efforts.



### Community Size and Engagement:

* Low.
* Need to learn the nuances / technicalities / rituals of community engagement.
* Need better messaging and partnerships to get on the radar.
* Need to focus on online marketing.
* Or maybe allowing it to grow organically, bit by bit?
* Previous approach of "community of communities" and hyper-networker didn't succeed
* Current numbers:
  * Twitter: [x.com/PlanetCouncil](https://x.com/PlanetCouncil) - 68 followers
  * Telegram: t.me/@planetarycouncil - 15 people

We are hoping that participating in GG21 as one of the featured community rounds will allow  ·¥ò ü·¥Ä…¥·¥á·¥õ·¥Ä Ä è ·¥Ñ·¥è·¥ú…¥·¥Ñ…™ ü  to accomplish much bigger reach.

### Type of Projects to Fund:
Already under the umbrella of ·¥ò ü·¥Ä…¥·¥á·¥õ·¥Ä Ä è ·¥Ñ·¥è·¥ú…¥·¥Ñ…™ ü or willing to join. Our eligibility crtiteria, our objectives and the type of projects to fund are aligned. Good selection of projects can be seen in the previous round,  link to the explorer](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/63).

Other characteristics that we will appreciate among projects:
* Maximum impact.
* Building civilisational infrastructure.
* Technology stack that is better than the current status quo.
![image|551x500](upload://1mr7bRCnEtWypGBXfUxirVKVzyB.jpeg)

The world is so ready for the upgrade:
* education
* media
* healthcare
* climate
* justice
* governance
* accounting for value

Example: [x.com/WeDontHaveTime/status/1750813829951627574](https://x.com/WeDontHaveTime/status/1750813829951627574)
![image|343x500](upload://mxpDzSP4WXmnY4dQR0Mk9V93WJV.jpeg)


*(now the work on accounting for full cost of the products / goods / services continues as [Impact Evaluation Foundation](https://impactevaluation.foundation))*

### Estimated Number of Eligible Grantees:

Approximately 20-30 in alignment with the previous round.
Up to 40 assuming other ecosystem participants decide to apply and join ·¥ò ü·¥Ä…¥·¥á·¥õ·¥Ä Ä è ·¥Ñ·¥è·¥ú…¥·¥Ñ…™ ü.

### Impact Assessment Plan:

Karma GAP.
We will encourage grantees to provide accurate description of their activities, over time this will build large dataset and will help with evaluation of other projects.

**EDIT / UPDATE:** Initially we planned to use Impact Evaluation Foundation (IEF) but not ready for prime time: https://impactevaluation.foundation/

### Additional Considerations:

We are big fans and supporters on Gitcoin, long term supporters, here for the long haul, playing long term game.

Previous bunch of suggestions on the gov forum: https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/beyond-qf-quadratic-funding-comments-suggestions-ideas/18875 

Also a suggestion to bring transparency to the process: https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-community-round-eligibility-criteria/19003/4?u=mars


### Potential Conflicts of Interest:

No shady affiliations.
No conflict of interest.
Other than being a human and having clear incentives for üåéüåçüåè to survive (and thrive)

### Compliance and regulatory statement

If for any reason some of the proposed mechanisms are making us with the eligibility criteria in the current form - https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-community-round-eligibility-criteria/19003 - we are more than happy to make necessary adjustments based on the feedback from the reviewers.

We intend to fully comply with the round requirements, Allo, passports, quid pro quo, etc... 

### Further questions comments
Here publicly on the forum and if no reply in 48 hours please follow up on the ·¥ò ü·¥Ä…¥·¥á·¥õ·¥Ä Ä è ·¥Ñ·¥è·¥ú…¥·¥Ñ…™ ü chat: [t.me/planetarycouncil](https://t.me/planetarycouncil)

In the next couple of days I will be offline (meditation retreat) coming back online week commencing 29th July: I have informed the team to be responsive.

 I will endevour to catch-up with onboarding / any other regulatory training (complete security training with Gitcoin‚Äôs security consultant) / any other requirements immediately upon my return.

<p>If you (the main round operator for this round) will not be available to do onboarding etc next week, I‚Äôm afraid it won‚Äôt be aligned. Onboarding also includes onboarding your own community and ensuring that you‚Äôll adhere to Gitcoin‚Äôs timelines.</p>
<p>And because the rest of your team aren‚Äôt active here (not best practice to ask the Gitcoin team to follow up in a TG channel), <em>and</em> your advisors haven‚Äôt been confirmed yet, I am suggesting that you further work to flesh out what you‚Äôd like to achieve with running a round (see resources I linked in an above comment) and come back to the drawing board in a future GG round!</p>
<p>I think with some work, alongside experienced round operators and advisors, you can set yourself up for greater success.</p>

<h3>Winners decide</h3>
<p>Based on my observation <em>(loyal community, network, good shillketing execution)</em> I assume that winners of the QF are reliable, trustworthy, with established trust and reputation. Because of that trustworthines and reputation I‚Äôm suggesting creating a new model of fund distribution: top 20% of the projects distribute 20% of the allocated funds:</p>
<ul>
<li>5% to projects that are good.</li>
<li>5% to projects that are good AND received little</li>
<li>5% to frens</li>
<li>5% to anyone you want, including keep to yourself</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be cumulative, so if there is project that is good, and received little, run by a fren, and in fact this is my free choice = all the 20% of the distribution can go to a single project.</p>

<p>I also recommend that you download our recently launched <a href="https://grantscanvas.gitcoin.co/">Grants Canvas</a> to help guide you! It‚Äôs an excellent resource to outline objectives and scope for a round. Also, we linked to our <a href="https://roundoperations.gitcoin.co/round-operations">Round Operator Runbook</a> in the eligibility. Did you take a look at that? It‚Äôs another very useful guide to help you set yourself up for success!</p>

<li>Sackler family (responsible for opioid epidemics)</li>
<li>Petro states</li>
<li>Military-industrial complex</li>

<p>Reason logic rationale: our main objective is system change. Some entities that benefit from the current toxic system might be against revolutionary policies. <em><strong>‚Äúkeep your friends close and your enemies closer‚Äù</strong></em> - we would like to work together and find a path forward that is serving entire humanity, that‚Äôs why in our work we need to address concerns coming from all areas of the political spectrum.</p>
<h3><a name="funding-mechanism-10" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#funding-mechanism-10"></a>Funding Mechanism:</h3>
<p>At the moment of writing: not set in stone. Depending whether we will become TOP5 and receive matching. <strong>EDIT / UPDATE:</strong> Most likely QF with some adjustments / experiments.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/one.png?v=12" title=":one:" class="emoji" alt=":one:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">:</strong> ‚ÄúWinners decide‚Äù,  top 20% of the projects distribute 20% of the allocated funds. Detailed description and rationale here: <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/beyond-qf-quadratic-funding-comments-suggestions-ideas/18875" class="inline-onebox">Beyond QF quadratic funding: comments, suggestions, ideas üí°</a></p>
<p><strong>Experiment <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/two.png?v=12" title=":two:" class="emoji" alt=":two:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">:</strong> We intend to introduce <code>minimal funding cut-off</code> to ensure funds are prioritised wisely. It behaves symmetrical to funding cap.</p>
<p>Previously, to ensure projects receive a sizeable amount, the selection was done at the application phase. We don‚Äôt want to act as gatekeepers. We want to encourage participation.</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://paragraph.xyz/@maearth/quadratic-funding-observations-from-grants-round-1" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Observations from Ma Earth‚Äôs first quadratic funding round</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In our research of others rounds, we repeatedly heard the complaint from projects that they received such small matching amounts in the end, it wasn‚Äôt necessarily worth the time involved in promoting it to their communities. That‚Äôs why we decided to go with 23 grantees, from a pool of ~50 qualified applicants. We wanted to ensure that once the $100,000 was divided up, it would still be meaningful for each project relative to their efforts.</p>

<ul>
<li>Low.</li>
<li>Need to learn the nuances / technicalities / rituals of community engagement.</li>
<li>Need better messaging and partnerships to get on the radar.</li>

<li>Or maybe allowing it to grow organically, bit by bit?</li>
<li>Previous approach of ‚Äúcommunity of communities‚Äù and hyper-networker didn‚Äôt succeed</li>
