https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/public-goods-open-call-for-proposals/8110
    Hi all, Toby from Other Internet here.

I wanted to make a post to call Stewards' attention to this [call for proposals Other Internet is conducting in collaboration with Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/blog/seeking-a-new-kind-of-public-good/).

The open call seeks **writing at 1200 words that makes the case for a future or an existing public goods project (within *or* beyond the crypto space). [Submissions can be sent here](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/1CS0BVdZB6PwvmpwkrsczFTCCB0yoXJ4-n2q88G_G7EM/edit) by August 17th.** The best responses will be awarded 1ETH.

We are conducting this project because we'd love to see more values-based public goods that, per our research, create [positive](https://otherinter.net/research/positive-sum-worlds/) externalities, proposed by Stewards and people they know. 

**This proposal is not limited to people working in the crypto space.** We've got a very diverse approval board and would like to see orgs outside of crypto who *are* working in the public's benefit applying. If you're involved in Gitcoin, it's likely you have friends and colleagues who are doing something relevant. Please tell them about the RFP and encourage them to apply! And of course, we encourage you to apply with your own ideas as well, responding to the linked prompt.

See the linked post for more details!
