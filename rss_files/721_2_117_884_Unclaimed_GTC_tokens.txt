    Roughly 2.12% of the max total supply of GTC tokens were left unclaimed: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4cb118aac7c32aefeea94ffd5a6c7ff763674dd89a4ad3718dc6acca6f00635c

Is there already a plan in place for handling these? If not, how should they be allocated?

            <p>There is no regulatory body for a DAO, the DAO members themselves either vote in support of a second claim window or they don‚Äôt.</p>
<p>So far it has not garnered enough support to even get to a proposal stage <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-second-claim-window-for-gtc/7388/67" class="inline-onebox">[Proposal] Second Claim Window for $GTC - #67 by makoto</a></p>
<p>It‚Äôs likely that we will focus on rewarding people for their contributions moving forward with these funds, as it‚Äôs a really complex thing to do an airdrop. You are welcome to comment in that thread as this is going to be deprecated soon.</p>

            <p>Yea I think the better option is to sent it to DAO treasury and make it some useful at Stewards Group. For those who didnt claim it just better think in it like it was burned it and forget it. There was 30 days to be prepared‚Ä¶ If you participated in this, you should be know about it. But anyway‚Ä¶ Just inside gitcoin grants there are always full of info and a lot of chances to get new coins and tokens and possibly future GTC airdrops‚Ä¶</p>

            <p>I got into crypto in 2017 and have become an avid user. Started trying to get into Gitlab and Gitcoin  Hackathons about a year ago but just didn‚Äôt have the Dev skills. Never stopped plugging away but unfortunately missed the airdrop. Gitcoin, Bankless, Finance.vote, and other DAOs using quadratic voting are certainly going to be needed in DeFi.eFi. I was able to buy a few GIT but maybe not enough to vote with (18 GIT). Would a new snapshot be a viable option to get coins to active community members who maybe didn‚Äôt jump in because they felt ‚Äúunqualified‚Äù? Thank you</p>

            <p>I think there could be several options ‚Ä¶<br>
1- Burn the remaining tokens (That would not support decentralization much).<br>
2- Distribute a certain amount in the next grants.<br>
3- Save them as treasure.</p>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/thekidconnect">@thekidconnect</a>,</p>
<p>I was recently included in both the GTC airdrop, and another which bears some similarities. It also formed a de-facto community DAO, and used email as means of validation of past participation.</p>
<p>I agree there should be some way for people who missed the window, or were otherwise erroneously missed, to file a claim so to speak. In the case of this other DAO, one thing I noticed is that they posted a ‚ÄúProof of Contribution‚Äù form for folks to submit if they didn‚Äôt get the airdrop.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a pretty simple form, but you‚Äôd need people to review the submissions. So it would take a proposal and a vote, and forming a team to carry it out, I guess? I‚Äôm new to this stuff ü§∑üòÑ</p>
<p>Anyway, here‚Äôs a link to the form as a reference: <a href="https://www.sporkdao.org/tokens#proof-of-contribution" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Spork DAO - Proof of Contribution Form</a></p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            <p>Agree Mutawa I experienced a similar situation and would appreciate a chance to claim. But at same time I can totally understand how burning the unclaimed GTC would be more beneficial to the community as a whole, where a second round claim would only serve to benefit a small fraction of individuals.</p>

I would like to do all I can to help make the cryptocurrency world as safe and secure as possible. So I have some ideas in mind that I would propose and allocate appropriately with beast intentions. I believe we all can keep it up together and make it happen. Thank you so much.</p>
