https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/there-are-some-questions-about-trust-verification/6517
    Hi, I'm new to gitcoin and want to improve my verification level. But I meet some problems.
First, when I use the SMS I can't receive the message on mobile, it's can't use in China?
Second, when I verify with Facebook and click the connect button, Facebook prompts me that the app number is invalid, it's a bug?

            <p>You can use Facebook</p>
<p>But outside that<br>
BrightId 50%<br>
Twitter 15%<br>
Sms 15%<br>
Gmail 15%</p>
<p>That will do</p>
