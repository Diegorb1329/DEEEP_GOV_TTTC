[Proposal - Akita] Place 100% in the Based Loans Dog Pound
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-akita-place-100-in-the-based-loans-dog-pound/3743
    Greetings, all. I come with a simple solution to your *dog* problem.

Based Loans is live: https://twitter.com/BasedProtocol/status/1398393295106097154?s=20

There's an $AKITA market.

Lock it upâ€”all of itâ€”and immediately start generating cash flow with the resulting APY.

Let the market decide what to do with $AKITA from then on and do some cool shit with the yield.

[Proposal - Akita] Place 100% in the Based Loans Dog Pound

            <p>Looking quickly at the based loans website it does not really inspire confidence and I donâ€™t know how much more work it would add to the gitcoin stewards team to maintain this. So I disagree with this proposal.</p>
