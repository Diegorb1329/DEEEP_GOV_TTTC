Proposal: Make ERC-20 Payments Permissionless?
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-make-erc-20-payments-permissionless/10410
    I propose making the usage of ERC-20 tokens for [bounty](https://gitcoin.co/explorer) payments permissionless.

As of now, only ERC-20 tokens manually approved by Gitcoin can be used for rewarding bounty hunters. This slows down Gitcoin adoption by DAOs that have a not yet approved token.

To make Gitcoin more permissionless and more decentralized, I propose we open up for the opportunity for Gitcoin Bounties to be paid for with _any_ ERC-20 token on Ethereum.

[poll type=regular results=always chartType=bar]
* Yes: Permissionless choice of ERC-20 token
* No: Gitcoin decides which ERC-20 tokens are allowed
