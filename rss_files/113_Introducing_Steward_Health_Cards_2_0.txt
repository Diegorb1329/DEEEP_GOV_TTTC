Introducing Steward Health Cards 2.0
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-steward-health-cards-2-0/10418
    Authored by @fred @sidcode

## Summary
The MMM-Workstream have released an update to the Steward Health Cards, live via both [DNS ](https://www.daostewards.xyz/)and [ENS](https://stewards.eth.limo/). The first version of the project was [launched in Q3 2021](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-steward-report-cards/8712) and has been discussed further in the context of the [Steward Council](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-the-steward-council/9485) spearheaded @Pop.

This thread summarizes our newest update with features that make the cards even more comprehensive and powerful. We invite the community to continue to share feedback and help us improve this public good further!

## Improvements
Even though the look and feel of the site has stayed close to the original design, the backend and data infrastructure has been completely rewritten. The site is now able to deliver greater granularity of metrics and much improved automation. This has been possible due to our partnership with [Karma](https://www.showkarma.xyz/), a reputation system for DAO contributors. Both Stewards Health Cards and Karma share a common goal of aggregating information and engagement of DAO contributors to increase transparency and accountability. As a result of us being able to grab richer data the overall health calculation should provide an improved representation of each Steward‚Äôs engagement in GitcoinDAO.

The way we calculate Stewards' health has also been adjusted based on feedback received from the community. Previously, all activity on the forum had the same weightage in the health calculation. With the new release, we are now differentiating between forum threads and forum posts with different weights. We are also differentiating between activities in the ‚Äú[Proposal discussion](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/governance-proposals/5)‚Äù section of the forum versus other sections. Activity in the Proposal discussion has a higher weight due to the higher level of conversation often found within this category.

**Variables**:

**`V`** = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vote participation on Snapshot (only proposals with >0.5M GTC are counted)
**`F_t`** =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forum Topics initiated (excluding the ‚ÄúProposal Discussion‚Äù category)
**`F_t_p`** = Forum Topics initiated in the ‚ÄúProposal Discussion‚Äù category
**`F_p`** = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forum posts (excluding the ‚ÄúProposal Discussion‚Äù category)
**`F_p_p`** = Forum posts in the ‚ÄúProposal Discussion‚Äù category
**`W`** = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workstream involvement. Lead role adds 5p and contributor adds 3p to health.

Visitors of the site can now choose to display metrics and health for either Lifetime or the Last 30 days. The new health score calculations are as follows:

**Lifetime health** : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `V*0.7 + F_t*1.1 + F_t_p*1.5 + F_p*0.6 + F_p_p*0.7 + W`

**Last 30-days health** : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`V*0.7 + F_t*1.1 + F_t_p*1.5 + F_p*0.7 + F_p_p*1 + W`

[Tally participation](https://www.tally.xyz/governance/eip155:1:0xDbD27635A534A3d3169Ef0498beB56Fb9c937489) was previously used in the health calculation but has now been removed. Proposals that reach Tally have already passed GitcoinDAO governance on the forum and Snapshot. The on-chain nature of Tally voting results in gas costs. Therefore, Stewards might not vote after the quorum has been reached which makes it an unsuitable data point to use in this context.

Please note that these formulas are our best attempt at fairly representing Steward engagement with the data available to us. We appreciate feedback and invite you all to help us improve further!

## Looking ahead

The vision of the Steward Health Cards has always been to provide the most valuable metrics for each Steward with the goal of improving the transparency and accountability of their work. The cards may function as a tool to assist delegators making informed decisions and to allow Stewards to compare their involvement relative to their peers. Steward Health Cards have been completely built in public and can be forked without permission by any community with a similar governance structure.

We are continuously working on improving the site with new features and improvements. A couple of features we have in the pipeline for the upcoming season include:

* Web3 login for Stewards to have control of their card and-
   -  Change their picture
   -  Add addresses
   -  Add link to Twitter & Github
   -  Ability to add additional Stewards to their Workstream
   - Ability to opt-out and remove their card
  
* Introduction of Workstream cards
* Minting ‚ÄúEnd of Season‚Äù-cards and allow users to scroll through Seasons
* Introducing additional metrics to capture other types of engagement such as on-chain compensation, attendance to monthly Steward calls and involvement in working groups not tied to any specific Workstream

We look forward to continuing working together with the community to map our collective health and make it available to the broader ecosystem as a public good!

            <p>I meant to say is the site open to forking/contribution. Like is it maintained openly on github or something similar? Or is it being worked on closed-source? Excited for the new site. Thanks shawn.</p>

            <p>The site is functioning as intended with correct metrics for each Steward. We‚Äôre in close collaboration with Karma to make sure metrics are always correct and up to date.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre also dedicated to make sure it straightforward to audit the metrics, both through the links on the card and through the repository.</p>
<p>Your card was an edge case due to you changing your Discourse username from blazingthirdeye to David_Dyor. Your previous message in the Steward intro-thread also got removed due to the name change which resulted in the card displaying empty stats.</p>
<p>This all resultet in your card having 0/10 health, but your role as Contributor to FDD gave you +3 which resulted in 3/10 overall health.</p>
<p>I was not aware of the name change previous to you flagging it, we‚Äôve pushed a fix to correct the name and your card is now correct. No other cards were affected.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs incredibly important for us to make sure metrics on the site are up to date and correct.<br>
When we realized some cards were displaying empty stats for 30 days we immediately removed that option until we had a fix deployed.</p>

            <p>Considering some aspects of the Steward Health Cards 2.0 are under repair, can we not take any snapshots or base any elections until the cards are confirmed as correct?  For example my score changed from 3/10 to 10/10 over the last day.  It is possible others are also misrepresented.  I don‚Äôt want to see any active stewards excluded from any opportunities because of a glitch.  I thought I read recently the next Steward Council will be created soon.  No council elections, which require a minimum health score, should proceed until we confirm the cards are displaying accurate data.  (imho)</p>
<p>Huge thanks to Fred for being on-top of this!</p>

            <p>‚ÄúLast 30 days‚Äù display metrics and health based on the last 30 days.</p>
<p>The daily update-script did lag for a couple of days but should now be up and running again.<br>
An indicator that display how many hours ago the data was last updated will be added to the site as well.<br>
Potentially we can also add information of the start- and end-dates when looking at ‚ÄúLast 30 days‚Äù. That indicator would for example today read: ‚ÄúApril 11th - May 11th‚Äù.</p>
<p>Raw data for the Stewards can be found in <a href="https://github.com/mmmgtc/stewards/blob/main/assets/json/stewards_data.json">this json</a>.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/krrisis">@krrisis</a>: We are looking into why the Twitter card has stopped working. Thanks for the heads up!</p>

            <p>SO excited to see this evolve and finally becoming an important, living DAO tool. As mentioned in all my conversations with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/fred">@Fred</a> and others in the DAO, building objective and dynamic engagement flows are key to evolving governance and making it sustainable.</p>
<p>When discussing the variables and metrics involved, it was very important to me to capture FAR more than votes for a more complete and complex view into participation. It enabled me to determine the formation of the Steward Council and I hope it will enable a more fluid governance structure. Being able to undelegate from a steward who may have dropped in engagement to another who is in line with one‚Äôs values AND has a high engagement score is much more in line with the ebbs and flows or activity and daily life.</p>
<p>My idea of expanding this model to workstreams and treasury health is in line with creating tooling that easily measures and quickly provides the context needed for informed, complete and  objective decision making.</p>

The site is now able to deliver greater granularity of metrics and much improved automation. This has been possible due to our partnership with <a href="https://www.showkarma.xyz/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Karma</a>, a reputation system for DAO contributors. Both Stewards Health Cards and Karma share a common goal of aggregating information and engagement of DAO contributors to increase transparency and accountability. As a result of us being able to grab richer data the overall health calculation should provide an improved representation of each Steward‚Äôs engagement in GitcoinDAO.</p>
<p>The way we calculate Stewards‚Äô health has also been adjusted based on feedback received from the community. Previously, all activity on the forum had the same weightage in the health calculation. With the new release, we are now differentiating between forum threads and forum posts with different weights. We are also differentiating between activities in the ‚Äú<a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/governance-proposals/5">Proposal discussion</a>‚Äù section of the forum versus other sections. Activity in the Proposal discussion has a higher weight due to the higher level of conversation often found within this category.</p>
<p><strong>Variables</strong>:</p>
<p><strong><code>V</code></strong> = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vote participation on Snapshot (only proposals with &gt;0.5M GTC are counted)<br>
<strong><code>F_t</code></strong> =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forum Topics initiated (excluding the ‚ÄúProposal Discussion‚Äù category)<br>
<strong><code>F_t_p</code></strong> = Forum Topics initiated in the ‚ÄúProposal Discussion‚Äù category<br>
<strong><code>F_p</code></strong> = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forum posts (excluding the ‚ÄúProposal Discussion‚Äù category)<br>
<strong><code>F_p_p</code></strong> = Forum posts in the ‚ÄúProposal Discussion‚Äù category<br>
<strong><code>W</code></strong> = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workstream involvement. Lead role adds 5p and contributor adds 3p to health.</p>
<p>Visitors of the site can now choose to display metrics and health for either Lifetime or the Last 30 days. The new health score calculations are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Lifetime health</strong> : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>V*0.7 + F_t*1.1 + F_t_p*1.5 + F_p*0.6 + F_p_p*0.7 + W</code></p>
<p><strong>Last 30-days health</strong> : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>V*0.7 + F_t*1.1 + F_t_p*1.5 + F_p*0.7 + F_p_p*1 + W</code></p>
<p><a href="https://www.tally.xyz/governance/eip155:1:0xDbD27635A534A3d3169Ef0498beB56Fb9c937489" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Tally participation</a> was previously used in the health calculation but has now been removed. Proposals that reach Tally have already passed GitcoinDAO governance on the forum and Snapshot. The on-chain nature of Tally voting results in gas costs. Therefore, Stewards might not vote after the quorum has been reached which makes it an unsuitable data point to use in this context.</p>
<p>Please note that these formulas are our best attempt at fairly representing Steward engagement with the data available to us. We appreciate feedback and invite you all to help us improve further!</p>

<p>The vision of the Steward Health Cards has always been to provide the most valuable metrics for each Steward with the goal of improving the transparency and accountability of their work. The cards may function as a tool to assist delegators making informed decisions and to allow Stewards to compare their involvement relative to their peers. Steward Health Cards have been completely built in public and can be forked without permission by any community with a similar governance structure.</p>
<p>We are continuously working on improving the site with new features and improvements. A couple of features we have in the pipeline for the upcoming season include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Web3 login for Stewards to have control of their card and-</p>
<ul>
<li>Change their picture</li>
<li>Add addresses</li>
<li>Add link to Twitter &amp; Github</li>
<li>Ability to add additional Stewards to their Workstream</li>
<li>Ability to opt-out and remove their card</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduction of Workstream cards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minting ‚ÄúEnd of Season‚Äù-cards and allow users to scroll through Seasons</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introducing additional metrics to capture other types of engagement such as on-chain compensation, attendance to monthly Steward calls and involvement in working groups not tied to any specific Workstream</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We look forward to continuing working together with the community to map our collective health and make it available to the broader ecosystem as a public good!</p>
