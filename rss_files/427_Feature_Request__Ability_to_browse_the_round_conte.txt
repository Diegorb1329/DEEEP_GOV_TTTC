    Gitcoin Rounds - massive festival of shilling.

But then the round is over and the content is not easily accessible.

**HINT 1:** Please allow users to browse the content of the round.

Only a few days to go but I know I would like to revisit a variety of projects after it is finished.

**HINT 2:** Please display full address *(in case someone wants to donate funds later on)*

            <p>I‚Äôm pretty sure I haven‚Äôt visited that page on the phone so it uses default settings.</p>
<p>Hidden by default = not ideal.</p>
<p>I was looking before posting and didn‚Äôt figure it out. I much prefer visual indication in the UI that round is finished, as opposed to digging into filters.</p>
