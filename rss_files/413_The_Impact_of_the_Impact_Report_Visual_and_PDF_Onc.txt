    Hello everyone!

I wanted to give you a heads up about a new couple of Dune dashboards on metrics/visuals about the NFT series to highlight grantee impact stories.

The first is about the [Gitcoin Impact Report](https://zora.co/collect/eth:0x50296fa66ea1486e3255f2f1f4a815a58f2a5fb2/1) Visual that you can check at ==> https://dune.com/ivanmolto/gitcoin-impact-report-video

The second is about the [Gitcoin Impact Report](https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x81d226fb36ca785583e79e84312335d0e166d59b/1) PDF Onchain that you can check at ==> https://dune.com/ivanmolto/gitcoin-impact-on-zora-network

If interested you can also compare some metrics of the Gitcoin NFT series with other branded/commemoratives NFTs from Zora, Dune, LayerZero, Rainbow, Conduit, Guild, Mirror, and so on here ==> https://dune.com/ivanmolto/og-commemorative-nfts

Some highlights:

- In Ethereum a 45% of the NFTs are minted via bundle mints just from only a 11,6% of the minters

- A 30,7% of the Ethereum minters also minted the Optimism PDF version

- The long journey of the Optimism PDF version with a good level of mints after 8 months of the launch

Happy to hear your comments, insights, and suggestions on how to enhance this dashboards. Thank you!
