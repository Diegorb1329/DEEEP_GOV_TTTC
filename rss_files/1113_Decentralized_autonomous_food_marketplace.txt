    Hi Gitcoin community, 

I'm working on a decentralized autonomous food marketplace run by  farmers, couriers, token holders and developers. Anyone can contribute to the marketplace, any interested buyer will be able to stake tokens in his nearby farm group, buy directly to food producers and once a week withdraw products or order for at home delivery. Decentralization will help farmer to manage and sell their products as digital asset, give incentives for couriers to offer delivery services and eliminate third parties needed for trust or plateform reliability. 
I just write a small proposal really incomplete about this project, I'm still studying and  I take all advices from the structure, technical parts, DAO governance, market analysis,  grammar and translations typos , to continue further.

Have a good day, 
Peace and love, 
Jules
