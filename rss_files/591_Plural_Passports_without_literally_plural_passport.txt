Plural Passports without literally plural passports?
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/plural-passports-without-literally-plural-passports/11341
    One of the great things about Gitcoin's Passport vision is that passports can draw legitimacy from multiple credentials ([pluralism](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/why-i-am-a-pluralist/)), rather than de-duping via a single-point-of-failure such as the USA's [Social Security Number (SSN)](https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/).

That said, "dual citizenship" presents a challenge if the end-user considers every "citizenship" as independently legitimate. (arguably, dual citizenship IRL is already overpowered even without this, but to a much smaller degree)

The fundamental choice is: if I have stamps from all of {PoH, Worldcoin, Idena, Bright ID, KYC, Web2}, what is the incentive for me to put all of these on the same passport, versus creating multiple passports?

The toy model I'll assume here is:
* There are a number of "personhood score" algorithms `personhood(credential1, credential2, ..., credentialN)` each developer can use.
* Each end-user application delivers a payoff of `payoff(personhood)` for a given personhood score.
* Composing these functions implies a payoff function `payoff(credential1, credential2, ..., credentialN)` for the application.
* If every application has their own passport registry, one may choose a different distribution of stamps across passports per app. If every applications checks the Gitcoin registry to dedup stamps, then users must use a consistent set of passports across all apps. In the latter case, each passport has a `total_payoff(credential1, credential2, ..., credentialN)`.
* WLOG, we'll just work with one `payoff` function.

## When to split and when to merge?
If there is some partition of my set of credentials such that `sum(payoff(credentials_i)) > payoff(credentials)`, then it is in my self-interest to maintain multiple passports along this partition.

If `payoff` is convex, then this will never hold, due to [multivariate Jensen's inequality](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2190473/generalizing-jensens-inequality-to-several-variables) (in fact, the opposite would hold - if there is someone with an orthogonal set of credentials, I should merge with them). However, personhood is explicitly meant to support concave payoffs - the problem of splitting credentials mirrors the problem of splitting tokens across wallets, in that 2x the personhood shouldn't give 2x the payoff.

In most cases (for example, cutoff-based systems where you get the max payoff for having a sufficient number of credentials), we'll be incentivized to split.

## Cross-credential linkability?
A natural way to approach this (other than accepting only one type of credential), would be to have e.g. a Worldcoin ID linkable to a Bright ID. That way, split passports can be detected and penalized.

Not only do we need to be able to detect this link, but we should be able to detect it *post-anonymization*. i.e. in the following diagram, the application must be able to deduce B without knowing C or D:

![image|414x297](upload://4ZqXrQg1Bd8vHW0w7XAum0a5QOR.png)

There are possibly some clever cryptographic ways this could be done, but at some point *someone* must know A. In practice this means that information linking a face, iris, social graph, Web2 handles, etc together would be out there somewhere.

One could argue that forming this profile is both inevitable (and presents no real harm) and a necessary precondition for Sybil resistance (otherwise, how do we prevent someone from using their iris for one account and their face for another?), and it is sufficient privacy to just not link this profile to any actual activity.

Another viewpoint could be that it is unviable for communities to accept outside credentials (especially anonymized credentials) without having their own additional screens.

I'm curious to hear thoughts on these viewpoints.

            <p>With this considered, I could imagine organizations/platforms who might use Passport for sybil resistance might not use it as we imagine. Instead of computing some ‚Äútrust score‚Äù as a function of all of the credentials within a passport, they choose 1 really robust/secure credential for their ecosystem. In this case, they don‚Äôt technically NEED Passport, but Passport creates a common interface for these credentials, so a platform/org does not need to research how to integrate with a specific credential‚Äôs SDK. Also, if they want to switch to a different credential, they can do that with ease without needing to deal with the different integration process of a separate credential. Also, from an end-user perspective, I can keep all of my credentials in one Passport. So if PlatformA requires BrightID and PlatformB requires KYC, then I have all of that in one place.</p>

<p>My question: If you could have any two passports, which combination would afford you the greatest freedom to travel around the world with minimal overlap &amp; reliance on a single passport?</p>
<p>The answer: Ghana &amp; United Arab Emirates. Those passports enable visa-free travel to 131 countries, with only 14 cases of overlap.</p>
<p>Runner-up combos include: Andorra &amp; Gambia, Cote d‚ÄôIvoire &amp; Japan, Guinea &amp; Malaysia.</p>
<p>(If you have a US passport, dual citizenship in Ghana or Mali would offer the most visa-tree travel optionality.)</p>

<p>The math here is actually important. Any system with a cap or tapering will be concave. For example the spreadsheets in the <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/characterizing-the-sybil-resistance-problem/11235">post you linked</a> (where you link to <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/establishing-a-new-process-for-identify-verification-scoring-and-removing-troubled-id-methods/7506/3">this</a>) are concave (e.g. if the aggregate match was $100k and I was capable of getting $1m cost-of-forgery then I would want to split into 10 passports). And indeed they should be concave: in a world where there are hundreds of verification mechanisms, someone shouldn‚Äôt get double the match because they had the tenacity to sign up with 20 verification methods instead of 10 (otherwise you get farming captchas all over again).</p>
<p>Another point to note is that forgeries themselves are not independent events. So it‚Äôs unclear if the assumption <code>cost_of_forgery(methods) == sum(cost_of_forgery(methods[i]))</code> is ideal.</p>

Plural Passports without literally plural passports?

            <p>This is a wonderful, well-articulated post. It triggered some late night thoughts.</p>
<p>I think I‚Äôm ok with people having multiple passports or identities ‚Äî provided they don‚Äôt engage in Sybil behavior.</p>
<p>Borrowing your dual citizenship analogy: dual citizens IRL can choose which passport to use, however they can‚Äôt use their passports to be registered in two countries at once or to count as two people in one country. Once they‚Äôve entered a country with a given passport, they can only leave by showing the same passport.</p>
<p>The primary issue Gitcoin cares about is stopping n sock puppets from getting match funds for funding the same project n times.</p>
<p>We need to learn to better detect Sybil behavior. We need to increase the price / diminish the benefit of Sybil behavior. We need to create positive network effects for reputation building behavior. Cross linking credentials could definitely be one of those ways!</p>

            <p>One of the great things about Gitcoin‚Äôs Passport vision is that passports can draw legitimacy from multiple credentials (<a href="https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/why-i-am-a-pluralist/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">pluralism</a>), rather than de-duping via a single-point-of-failure such as the USA‚Äôs <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Social Security Number (SSN)</a>.</p>
<p>That said, ‚Äúdual citizenship‚Äù presents a challenge if the end-user considers every ‚Äúcitizenship‚Äù as independently legitimate. (arguably, dual citizenship IRL is already overpowered even without this, but to a much smaller degree)</p>
<p>The fundamental choice is: if I have stamps from all of {PoH, Worldcoin, Idena, Bright ID, KYC, Web2}, what is the incentive for me to put all of these on the same passport, versus creating multiple passports?</p>
<p>The toy model I‚Äôll assume here is:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are a number of ‚Äúpersonhood score‚Äù algorithms <code>personhood(credential1, credential2, ..., credentialN)</code> each developer can use.</li>
<li>Each end-user application delivers a payoff of <code>payoff(personhood)</code> for a given personhood score.</li>
<li>Composing these functions implies a payoff function <code>payoff(credential1, credential2, ..., credentialN)</code> for the application.</li>
<li>If every application has their own passport registry, one may choose a different distribution of stamps across passports per app. If every applications checks the Gitcoin registry to dedup stamps, then users must use a consistent set of passports across all apps. In the latter case, each passport has a <code>total_payoff(credential1, credential2, ..., credentialN)</code>.</li>
<li>WLOG, we‚Äôll just work with one <code>payoff</code> function.</li>
</ul>

<p>If there is some partition of my set of credentials such that <code>sum(payoff(credentials_i)) &gt; payoff(credentials)</code>, then it is in my self-interest to maintain multiple passports along this partition.</p>
<p>If <code>payoff</code> is convex, then this will never hold, due to <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2190473/generalizing-jensens-inequality-to-several-variables" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">multivariate Jensen‚Äôs inequality</a> (in fact, the opposite would hold - if there is someone with an orthogonal set of credentials, I should merge with them). However, personhood is explicitly meant to support concave payoffs - the problem of splitting credentials mirrors the problem of splitting tokens across wallets, in that 2x the personhood shouldn‚Äôt give 2x the payoff.</p>
<p>In most cases (for example, cutoff-based systems where you get the max payoff for having a sufficient number of credentials), we‚Äôll be incentivized to split.</p>

<a name="cross-credential-linkability-2" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#cross-credential-linkability-2"></a>Cross-credential linkability?</h2>
<p>A natural way to approach this (other than accepting only one type of credential), would be to have e.g. a Worldcoin ID linkable to a Bright ID. That way, split passports can be detected and penalized.</p>
<p>Not only do we need to be able to detect this link, but we should be able to detect it <em>post-anonymization</em>. i.e. in the following diagram, the application must be able to deduce B without knowing C or D:</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/db4391/original/2X/2/22fa83b6e1c3b7f5d803008e3d6d1998abed7919.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="4ZqXrQg1Bd8vHW0w7XAum0a5QOR" width="414" height="297"></p>
<p>There are possibly some clever cryptographic ways this could be done, but at some point <em>someone</em> must know A. In practice this means that information linking a face, iris, social graph, Web2 handles, etc together would be out there somewhere.</p>
<p>One could argue that forming this profile is both inevitable (and presents no real harm) and a necessary precondition for Sybil resistance (otherwise, how do we prevent someone from using their iris for one account and their face for another?), and it is sufficient privacy to just not link this profile to any actual activity.</p>
<p>Another viewpoint could be that it is unviable for communities to accept outside credentials (especially anonymized credentials) without having their own additional screens.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm curious to hear thoughts on these viewpoints.</p>
