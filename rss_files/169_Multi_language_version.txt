            <p>The suggestion is very good and many of us thinking the same on the language proposal.<br>
I see the volunteers want to help Chinese, Hindi, Portuguese, Spanish and that’s so grateful.</p>
<p>Every member’s voice in community is important to Gitcoin.</p>

            <p>There’s been some conversation about this in <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/built-multiple-language-community/2314">this</a> thread too. Taking from there, I think the optimal structure would involve two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forums/channels/resources for additional languages</li>
<li>a role (“Ambassadors”) who can connect the communities. This allows ideas, opinions, and sentiments to flow between the communities. Maybe this would be a bountied job? I’m not sure, it does sound like a fair amount of work.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reasoning behind the second is simple: if we have say, Chinese channels, but the English-speaking channels are completely siloed off, then the Chinese channels lose out on announcements and news in the English (the team is all English-speaking afaik), and the English channels lose out on being able to accommodate the needs and sentiments of the Chinese-speaking channels. (And more, these are just examples.)</p>

            <p>Agree!!! We have to identify methods in order to overcome language barrier. A user-friendly and multilingual support platform should be developed, which could then better facilitate the governance process and discussion.</p>
