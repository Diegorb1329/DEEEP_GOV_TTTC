Anouncing the Token Engineering Round for GG19
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/anouncing-the-token-engineering-round-for-gg19/16809
    Hello everyone, this is Enti from the Token Engineering Commons, where I serve as a Project Manager, and I've been leading our Grants Program since its inception during the Beta Round earlier this year.

So far, we've successfully completed two rounds, each with a $25k matching pool. These rounds have not only increased the visibility of the field but have also harnessed the collective wisdom of the community to make more informed decisions on how to distribute funds effectively.

We're also at the forefront of what we call "Tunable QF," a method to enhance and refine QF results by incorporating onchain data. In our case, this has helped elevate the significance of Subject Matter Experts, as explained [here](https://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/expertise-and-quadratic-funding-bd4f0c5c3e23). We firmly believe that Tunable QF will provide round operators with greater flexibility and empower them to safeguard and reward the values and expertise of their communities. We'll be sharing more about this exciting development soon ;).

For a closer look at the results and additional information, please visit the following links:
- [Round 1](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/results-of-te-grants-round-1/1275?u=enti)
- [Round 2](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/results-of-te-grants-round-2/1302?u=enti)
- [Incorporating Expertise into Quadratic Funding (Tunable QF)](https://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/expertise-and-quadratic-funding-bd4f0c5c3e23)

Now, with the [GG19 outline and strategy](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg19-outline-and-strategy/16682) released, we'd like to announce our commitment to continue organizing the Token Engineering round as one of the now called Community Rounds within GG19.

<p>I‚Äôve heard of some round operators that wanted to only calculate donations from token holders. This Tunable QF would allow them to do that, or even just pick some coefficient X in the middle to give more power to token holders vs other donors.</p>
<p>Some of our work in the tool can be seen here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRInR_xVpOQ" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRInR_xVpOQ</a>, and by next week we should have ready a forum post to publish here, with more information about what we‚Äôre doing and a proposal for support on the R&amp;D of this from the Gitcoin DAO.</p>

            <p>Congrats on two successful rounds <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/enti">@enti</a> and I‚Äôm excited TEC is returning for a 3rd! Having rounds that continuously run and grow over time is one of the most important success metrics for Grants Stack IMO so this is great to see. Let us know how we can support you before GG19 kicks off <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/saluting_face.png?v=12" title=":saluting_face:" class="emoji" alt=":saluting_face:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
