    Despite Gitcoin being one of the most successful non-speculative products on Ethereum, GTC is down 96.8%.

People who immediately dumped GTC upon airdrop got more $ out of it, than true believers like the cofounder Scott Moore, who is now down 96.8%.

This simply isn‚Äòt right.

## State of things

Unfortunately, as we‚Äòve seen time & time again, price action is the best predictor, marketer & driver of project success, for better or worse.

Numba go up > people happy > people talk about the project > project usage grows > project attracts contributors > numba go up > repeat.

Opposite is true as well. Numba go down > people unhappy > people leaving > less work > smaller treasury > lower compensation > less work done > numba go down

At the time, Gitcoin is simply not investable.
This has resulted in talent bleed

## Wat do?
I know all of us regens liked believing token price is irrelevant, but thats 100% incorrect.

Minimum viable:
- Temporarily stop funding all non-critical proposals for GTC
- Proceed to implementing a 10% buybacks with all revenue/inbound $

Additional considerations:
- Propose all sub-projects like Allo & whatever other project was funded by GTC, to perpetually kick back 10%(?) of its own revenue back here, immediately converted to GTC
- Make it a default requirement that each project funded by GTC perpetually does either that, or sends 10%(?) of its own token supply to Gitcoin

GTC Maximalism:
- Make it so that 100% of matching funds are used to buy GTC, and projects are dropped GTC instead of $ or ETH. This would create a dynamic where GTC keeps going up because not all projects convert all of their GTC to $, and instead choose to become stakeholders of Gitcoin.

I‚Äòd personally want to implement all of these changes, but obviously not everyone is as extreme üòÇ

Thoughts? Other ideas for regenerating GTC? Think it shouldnt be done at all?

<p>This is a basic question-- But is it necessary for GTC value to be higher for this kind of product adoption and revenue to continue? Is GTC used for anything other than governance votes? And governance votes don‚Äôt directly impact who gets grants, right? Or do I misunderstand how it works together?</p>

            <p>I completely agree with your assessment of the situation. The fact that GTC is down 96.8% despite Gitcoin being a successful product is a clear indication that the token price has a significant impact on the project‚Äôs overall health. It‚Äôs not just about the price itself, but also about the perception and sentiment it creates among users, contributors, and investors.</p>
<p>The feedback loop you described, where price action drives project success, is a real phenomenon that we‚Äôve seen play out time and time again in the crypto space. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle that can be difficult to break, especially when the price is trending downwards.</p>
<p>I think it‚Äôs time for us to acknowledge that token price is not irrelevant, and that it has a significant impact on the project‚Äôs ability to attract and retain talent, as well as its overall treasury and compensation structure.</p>
<p>So, what can we do about it? Here are a few potential ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Re-evaluate the tokenomics</em>: Perhaps it‚Äôs time to reassess the token‚Äôs supply, distribution, and use cases to see if there are any opportunities to improve its value proposition.</li>
<li><em>Improve communication and transparency</em>: Regular updates on the project‚Äôs progress, milestones, and challenges can help to build trust and confidence among users and investors.</li>
<li><em>Focus on building a strong community</em>: A strong, engaged community can help to drive adoption, retention, and ultimately, price appreciation.</li>
<li><em>Explore alternative funding models</em>: Perhaps it‚Äôs time to consider alternative funding models, such as grants, sponsorships, or even traditional venture capital, to reduce the project‚Äôs reliance on token price.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just a few ideas, and I‚Äôm sure there are many more potential solutions. I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts and ideas on how we can address this challenge and get GTC back on track."</p>

<p>i truly believe in gitcoins mission, purpose, network and plan to keep grinding on it.  to me its clear were onto something important and fundamental to the 21st century.  but i pay more attention to fundamentals (checkout my recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Green_Pill_Podcast">podcasts</a> or <a href="https://allobook.gitcoin.co/">books</a> if you want to see what i see) than others do.</p>
<p>curious to see where this thread goes!  maybe the community of stewards can come to alignment on a path forward for GTC in the comments.  there is a hiearchy of ways to participate (proposals &gt; comments &gt; twitposts, constructive &gt; unconstructive) and id especially value if constructive proposals that we can vote yes/no on are brought forward to advance the convo.</p>

<p>That sounds awesome! But from the outside view, it seems all of the cool ‚ÄúGitcoin experiments‚Äù are simply projects that you‚Äòre starting, building &amp;/or funding yourself‚Ä¶ Even Schelling Point seems to have been brought back by yourself, not the Gitcoin community. Is this correct or am I dead wrong?</p>

<p>I just wanted to name 1 specific person and he‚Äòs the one that I recently asked if he‚Äòs still holding onto all of his GTC. I assume you‚Äòre still holding it too, but I never asked you. And DAMN, appreciate this context, had no clue that was the fund he was talking about <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/exploding_head.png?v=12" title=":exploding_head:" class="emoji" alt=":exploding_head:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

</aside>
<p>Definitely fully agree increasing product adoption &amp; crossing into profitability/sustainability should be top priorities. But I also definitely think some of value should be flowing into or through GTC.</p>
<p>And just to make it clear - I‚Äòm not even saying this to pump my bags. I‚Äòm not holding any GTC at this point, but almost 100k addresses do. And I‚Äòm sure many more would be keeping or buying &amp; holding if there was any value accrual mechanism whatsoever‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Kudos to you for keeping on keeping on <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/saluting_face.png?v=12" title=":saluting_face:" class="emoji" alt=":saluting_face:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p>Hi peth,</p>
<p>thanks for the post!  we are both aligned in wanting to see gitcoin be successful.</p>
<p>how to do that is a good question.</p>
<p>lets start with whats going well: gitcoins product adoption is up ($7m in GMV in 2023 to $10m in 2024), and revenue is up (now close to $1m in 2024).  we are doing innovative funding experiments again (like the deepfunding pilot we just announced with vitalik.</p>
<p>honestly the sky is the limit for gitcoin imo. we‚Äôve been in every major funding mechanism the last 2 cycles. just launched another funding mechanism with vitalik and have other cool stuff in the works. we could build  into the capital allocation layer of the tokenized internet. And continue progressively decentralizing along the way.  is this a promise? no. is it a possibility? yes, and it becomes more probable if people show up and make it happen.</p>
<p>but that doesnt seem like its been enough.  what to do is the question?  so i am glad you are laying out some options.  <em>( and thank you for bringing the convo on the gov forum, most ppl just complain on social media )</em></p>
<p>before we get to that.</p>

<p>im open to seeing this happen. i think a debate about how to do it is healthy.  fwiw my legal counsel has advised me personally not to create an ‚Äúexpectation of profit‚Äù or ‚Äúpump the token‚Äù.  but that doesn‚Äôt mean i am obligated to try and stop you or cant answer questions.</p>

            <p>Despite Gitcoin being one of the most successful non-speculative products on Ethereum, GTC is down 96.8%.</p>
<p>People who immediately dumped GTC upon airdrop got more $ out of it, than true believers like the cofounder Scott Moore, who is now down 96.8%.</p>
<p>This simply isn‚Äòt right.</p>
<h2><a name="state-of-things-1" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#state-of-things-1"></a>State of things</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, as we‚Äòve seen time &amp; time again, price action is the best predictor, marketer &amp; driver of project success, for better or worse.</p>
<p>Numba go up &gt; people happy &gt; people talk about the project &gt; project usage grows &gt; project attracts contributors &gt; numba go up &gt; repeat.</p>
<p>Opposite is true as well. Numba go down &gt; people unhappy &gt; people leaving &gt; less work &gt; smaller treasury &gt; lower compensation &gt; less work done &gt; numba go down</p>
<p>At the time, Gitcoin is simply not investable.<br>
This has resulted in talent bleed</p>
<h2><a name="wat-do-2" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#wat-do-2"></a>Wat do?</h2>
<p>I know all of us regens liked believing token price is irrelevant, but thats 100% incorrect.</p>
<p>Minimum viable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temporarily stop funding all non-critical proposals for GTC</li>
<li>Proceed to implementing a 10% buybacks with all revenue/inbound $</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Propose all sub-projects like Allo &amp; whatever other project was funded by GTC, to perpetually kick back 10%(?) of its own revenue back here, immediately converted to GTC</li>
<li>Make it a default requirement that each project funded by GTC perpetually does either that, or sends 10%(?) of its own token supply to Gitcoin</li>
</ul>
<p>GTC Maximalism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make it so that 100% of matching funds are used to buy GTC, and projects are dropped GTC instead of $ or ETH. This would create a dynamic where GTC keeps going up because not all projects convert all of their GTC to $, and instead choose to become stakeholders of Gitcoin.</li>
</ul>
<p>I‚Äòd personally want to implement all of these changes, but obviously not everyone is as extreme <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/joy.png?v=12" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>Thoughts? Other ideas for regenerating GTC? Think it shouldnt be done at all?</p>
