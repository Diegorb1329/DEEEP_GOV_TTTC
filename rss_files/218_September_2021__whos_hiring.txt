            <p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>I believe that besides general onboarding process, we could have more onboarding ways.</p>
<p>Like what you say, maybe just invite the senior people from your friends and introduce them to the workstream coordinators. And then onboarding.</p>

            <p>All the openings are available after filling out the typeform. Everyone who is onboarded gets the comment access to start conversations with the leads about that specific stream and not get spammed by anyone on the internet.</p>
<p>We will look into how to open this up better to the web as a whole!</p>

            <p>Thanks. The typeform is a good generalized onboarding tool.</p>
<p>Maybe it isfor someone whos already interested in GitcoinDAO, but not when were trying to do outbound.</p>
<p>When I sent this thread to some senior engineer / CTO friends I know their feedback was ‚Äúwhy am I filling out this typeform? can you tell me what positions are open?‚Äù tho.</p>
