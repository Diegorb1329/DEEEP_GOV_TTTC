[S15 Proposal - INTEGRATED] PGF Budget Request
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s15-proposal-integrated-pgf-budget-request/11220
    # Essential Intents

In S15, PGF has components of our work that focus on all four of the DAO's Essential Intents - though we primarily emphasize EI1 and EI4. As a reminder, the EIs are:

* EI1: Protocol Adoption
* EI2: Financial Sustainability
* EI3: DAO Organization
* EI4: Grants Program Success

# TL;DR

In S15, PGF will focus on setting up the grants program for a transition into a protocol world.

If successful in S15, the workstream will define – with the rest of the DAO’s involvement – where the grants program is headed, will help the DAO better track partner conversations, and will continue to iterate on ops structures (e.g., horizontal scaling, more self-serve for partners and clear managed service tiers) within our cGrants rounds today.

In the context of the program specifically, PGF will continue to improve the overall round experience, meaningfully engage grantees, funders, and partners, and in turn increase the number of measurable success stories rounds help create.

Beyond grants, PGF will help spin out a public goods coalition (pgDAO) that will act as an investment DAO allowing partners to commit long term to empowering large scale internet-native communities to fund their shared needs and create a sustainable funding source for the grants program.

Based on what we learned from S14, we will be more intentional about what sub-rounds we fundraise for – and what constitutes a “minimum viable round” for side rounds – in GR15. We will decouple the main and side rounds in GR15, a step toward a permissionless protocol and improve our scalability processes, based on some of the challenges (e.g., tagging) in GR14. We will also add a focus area within our grassroots efforts on engaging grantees to drive higher quality grant applications. Finally, we intend to better define the distinction between the program and the protocol heading into a nascent grants 2.0 world.

Our **Always-On Goals**, which our S15 objectives map to, are as follows:

**1. Increase Sustainable Funding for Gitcoin Grantees**

* S15 Objective 1: Grow net new S15 matching funds and partners by 25%
* S15 Objective 2: Define Service Levels & Model for the Protocol (based on continued learnings from the design partner program)


**2. Improve Overall Grantee Quality & Success**

* S15 Objective 3: Leverage grassroots efforts to increase grantee quality & engagement
* S15 Objective 4: Improve grant eligibility & round timeline processes alongside FDD

**3. Scale Grants Program Process & Workflow**

* S15 Objective 5: Define Program & Protocol Structure in a Grants 2.0 World
* S15 Objective 6: Scale PGF team + contributor processes to reach a healthy homeostasis

## Amount

PGF is requesting **$664,550** (232k GTC at a spot price of $2.87). This is a decrease of 31% vs. our S14 requested budget of $960,000.

The budget is broken up into three key areas of focus, aimed at creating a sustainable grants program and, eventually, protocol.

* Grassroots
* Grants Operations
* Partnerships

This budget does not include the additional 60 days of reserves. Breakdown of the budget by workstream, plus reserves, is detailed at the bottom of this post.

The GTC total will be determined, based on (a) the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally, and (b) the remaining balance in the PGF Multisig (which will determine how much net new funding we require).

# Milestone Report

In our previous budget, we outlined a number of key objectives, many of which were less precise than in our revised format for S15. We have done our best to highlight the wins and losses, but welcome any questions about precise metrics used.

|Initiative/Dept|Objectives Past Season|Value Delivered|
| --- | --- | --- | 
|**Inspiring Spaces: Sustain and grow the Public Library community as a gateway for new contributors** | <ul><li>Continue regular Public Library sessions and invite salient thinkers on Public Goods and Web3 as our speakers and moderators while inviting new participants interested in Gitcoin’s mission| <ul><li> Develop and operationalise an onboarding flow for reliable participants to contribute to the Public Goods Funding workstream or other workstreams around GitcoinDAO. </li><li>Kickstart initiatives hosted by our Public Library participants beyond Gitcoin to discuss Public Goods </li><li> We hosted a great mix of salient thinkers, including the President of RadicalXChange and the CEO of Ethelo. </li><li>During GR14, we specifically hosted topics related to GRs. We have 236 members and consistently engage 20 every week. </li><li>We created a PGF-specific 90-day onboarding flow which we operationalized with two S14 hires, and will continue iterating going forward. </li><li> Interviewed 20 potential contributors for the PGF workstream and GitcoinDAO. </li><li>Developed best-practices for WS-wide meetings, prioritizing updates asynchronously and using synchronous time together to discuss important topics. </li><li>We experimented with an intimate reading club exploring Ivan Illich’s work, and will continue to experiment with how we can provide grantees non-monetary value through library-offshoots in S15. </li><li>Continued to explore Gitcoin-sponsored courses.||
**Accessible dialogue: Host the “Public Goods are Good” Twitter Space consistently** | <ul><li>Maintain a regular space for people curious about Public Goods and interact with key organizations and people through Twitter Spaces </li><li>Support GR14 by hosting discussions on cause rounds and showcasing grantees | <ul><li>Throughout S14, we held 10 spaces, and each space highlighted past/present grantees or past/present funders, with guests ranging from Solarpunk Girl and Austin Griffith to Filecoin and Coinbase. </li><li>We had an average of 182 attendees at each Twitter space, with the range being 268 (GR14 Funder Feature) and 142 (GR14 Diversity Equity & Inclusion Panel). 
| **Nurture ideas: Kickstart a publication on Public Goods** | <ul><li>Grow awareness of Public Goods and inspire action to contribute </li><li>Create a public good (non-rivalrous, non-excludable open publication) about Public Goods to move beyond synchronous community interactions |  <ul><li> During S14, we authored a manifesto for the publication </li><li> Explored working with writers and former editors of major publications, but failed to operationalize the publication in its entirety | 
| **Community Cartography: Support and grow the ImpactDAO mapping initiative** | <ul><li>Complete an initial map of ImpactDAOs in the space to provide a baseline for evaluation and insight generation </li><li>Explore mental models, narratives, relationships, and culture around ImpactDAOs to help foster the growth of the Public Goods ecosystem through educational material and research | <ul><li>An initial map and book was launched by Owocki and Ale during EthAmsterdam at the end of S13. </li><li>Narratives, relationships, mental models, and the culture surrounding ImpactDAOs have been thoroughly explored during S14. </li><li>The ImpactDAO Cartography Telegram group remains active with over 570 members and recurring weekly sessions to ideate and track progress on initiatives. </li><li> The term ‘ImpactDAO’ has been cemented into web3 as a canonical term encapsulating the ability for web3 to produce positive externalities.
| **Community Lore: Create art for Gitcoin’s lore with collectively-owned IP**  | <ul><li> Grow a collective of lore-builders, creatives, and builders shaping a solarpunk future through the Gitcoin mythos |<ul><li> Funded Comic #4 which will be released at an upcoming conference in Q3.
|**Scale: Grow grants program** | <ul><li> Increase number of high quality grants that raise >$5K/quarter by 50% (pending market condition) * Increase the number of side rounds by 100% | <ul><li> GR14 had 155 grantees who raised over $5K total, compared with 157 in GR13. We actually don’t think we yet have the right metric to track here – “high quality grantees” being synonymous with those who raise $5K/quarter is not quite accurate. Defining better grantee quality metrics is a focus for the grantee engagement work slotted for S15. </li><li> Side rounds grew by 100% in H1 2022 – 9 in GR12 to 18 in GR14
| **Sustainability: Set ourselves up to execute grants on a larger scale** | <ul><li>Minimize the number of hiccups during the round </li><li>Achieve NPS for participants, partners, and donors of >70 </li><li>Test at least two new constructs for funding grants (e.g., public goods coalition, aqueduct) | <ul><li>We didn’t have any major outages or program-related issues during GR13 or GR14, and most friction points were the result of inter-WS coordination, which we hope to address during GR15 </li><li>We shared surveys with grantees and donors, and have conducted retros with partners. </li><li> Grantees and donors have been slow to respond, and we were able to get rough estimates for an NPS from partners by asking “How satisfied are you?” Based on low partner-response for retros, we will send out a survey for GR15. </li><li> We’ve made considerable progress in launching a public goods coalition in the form of pgDAO, and this will remain an ongoing priority for S15.
| **Decentralization: Continue to decentralize grants program** |<ul><li> Move grants ops completely out of Gitcoin Holdings & into the DAO </li><li>  Increase role of stewards/community in grants strategy & decision-making; define governance surface area | <ul><li> Grant ops has been successfully moved out of holdings and into the PGF workstream! </li><li> We’ve continued to welcome and encourage steward and community feedback on grants strategy and decision-making via the governance forum post and following discussions (i.e., Annika’s post about GR14 Round Structure & Grants Eligibility Update has 1.7k views and 64 comments).
| **Ecosystem Funders: Test Grants 2.0 assumptions** | <ul><li> Run a new Ethereum Infrastructure round in GR14 and solicit funds from ecosystem builders </li><li> Run 15-20 Ecosystem Rounds in GR14 </li><li> Assess which ecosystem funders are equipped & motivated to self-run rounds </li><li> Share survey / interview results from post-GR13 partner discovery work | <ul><li> We successfully ran a new Ethereum Infrastructure round in GR14, deploying $500K in matching funds in this round alone </li><li> We successfully ran 14 ecosystem rounds and 3 cause rounds. </li><li> As a result of running so many rounds, we were able to get good data points on funders & their motivation/ability in self-running rounds </li><li>  We shared survey and interview results from GR13 internally
| **Scale: Grow the size of matching rounds executed by the DAO** | <ul><li> Increase the number of net new partners we work with by 20% </li><li> Increase the average size of side rounds (with emphasis on cause rounds) by 50% </li><li> Continue to level up new full time and part time contributors towards the above |<ul><li> During GR14, of the 28 total partners, 16 were new partners - meaning that new partners increased by 57% </li><li> Overall - cause round totals increased by 28% vs. goal of 50%, and ecosystem rounds increased by 52% </li><li> In GR13 - we had: <ul><li> $1.2M main round </li><li>  $489K Ecosystem round total </li><li> $700K Ukraine round </li><li> $465K Climate round </li><li> $40K Longevity round </li><li>  ($1.2M cause round total) </li><li> $3.169M total funding </li></ul> </li><li>In GR14 - we had:<ul><li> $1M main round</li><li> $742K Ecosystem round total </li><li> $530K Climate round </li><li> $500K ETHInfra round </li><li> $350K Advocacy round </li><li> $150K DEI round </li><li> ($1.53M cause round total) </li><li> $3.417M total funding </li></ul> </li><li> This is especially meaningful considering GR14 happened in a bear market - with wildly different funder sentiment than GR13 (more headwind), yet we were able to make substantial gains.</li><li> We also added much-needed capacity to the team in the two strong fundraisers with strong Web3 ecosystem context. | 
**Sustainability: Tighten processes to scout and execute partnerships (Growth Ops / Partnerships)** |  <ul><li> Refresh partnerships process to handle a larger load of potential partnerships while ensuring that we seek out the most aligned partners to work together by growing the partnerships team’s capacity </li><li> Continue to build out new documentation to ensure members of the team have full context on each other’s responsibilities and current objectives (e.g. robust relationship tracking) </li><li> Formalize our evaluation process to support partnerships across the DAO with support from Stewards via the mutual grants committee | <ul><li> Hubspot is live, allowing us to both define a process for handling a larger load of partners and increase our team’s overall capacity. </li><li> Hubspot and its previous iteration on Notion have resulted in accessible “sources of truth” that enable all contributors to share context and view each other’s responsibilities. </li><li> Mutual Grants Committee is live and active, with several grants in the pipeline and one recently completed with Radicle. We have a robust v0 framework which is now being used to evaluate ongoing potential mutual grants.| 
**Measure impact: Help set the stage for new cause rounds that augment our mission (Growth Ops / Partnerships)** |  <ul><li> Fundraise for the Ethereum infrastructure round to bring Gitcoin back to its roots </li><li> Focus on bringing in new values aligned web2 partners like Fifty Years and double down with other existing values aligned partners like Protocol Labs | <ul><li>Ran a very successful Eth Infra round - funding core projects in the space with funds from high-signal partners. </li><li> During GR14 we brought in 28 partners, 16 of which are new values-aligned partners. |
**LARP together: Experiment with fundraising efforts around art, open-source partnerships, and collectively-owned IP** | <ul><li> Kickstart a new team focused on experimenting with different methodologies to raise funds for Public Goods </li><li>Raise at least 20 ETH through 1-3 net new NFT sales | <ul><li>  Ultimately, this initiative did not fully come to fruition. While working on the project, market conditions shifted such that we couldn’t fully resource the project as we had hoped to - due to comic production involving fiat-heavy costs. This led to contributor churn and the project didn’t end up actualizing its initial goals. </li><li>We will be sunsetting this initiative, and going forward we will operationalize better treasury management practices

Happy to take a look if useful and frankly it would give be an opportunity to learn more about where the rubber hits the road in this amazing DAO.  LMK I’m on discord as well of course</p>

            <p>Yeah, Hubspot has been an amazing tool thus far. Getting everyone accustomed to using it, adding in past data, figuring out how to set up dashboard, and so on is an ongoing thing we’re doing at the moment.</p>
<p>In terms of targets, we’ve outlined what it is we are looking to do in the budget above, and in terms of operationalizing it, the fundraising team as a whole are all tasked with making sure everything we do is going into the Hubspot.</p>
<p>That way we’ll be able to assess things after the round looking back, and is also why I’d reiterate that anyone who wants read only access is more than welcome to have it.</p>

            <p>Thank you <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle">@Kyle</a> for your support! This means a lot to the team and we’ve been working hard to understand these concerns and the future of Gitcoin as a protocol. Therefore, I will commit to ensuring that the Grassroots team will have a more holistic view on community engagement and to orient around the highest leverage we can as <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/jodi">@jodi</a> and <span class="mention">@Lindsey</span> have advocated for too. This might also mean that we might have to rearrange the team and transition members around or out of the DAO. We’d definitely rather have these conversations earlier than later.</p>

            <p>Agreed.  I asked about funnel, cycle time, etc. fwiw and didn’t see a response other than that it does not make sense to measure activity alone - which is fair unless you can see activities tied to future outcomes.</p>
<p>We might actually be underinvesting in partnerships &amp; grassroots &amp; PGF altogether; i.e. we may have high return efforts that are not well measured yet that are going to be comparatively starved because of this lack of measurement.  Anyway - more data &amp; as you said a plan for operationalizing the accountability.</p>

<p>This was tough to grasp without the explanation. In my area libraries are usually silent spaces with books, where speaking is discouraged. So I didn’t expect it to be a discord channel. <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=12" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> My best bet was that it is an list of public goods like <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Registry - Digital Public Goods Alliance</a></p>
<p>But yea, if there is an initiative to record opinions, then I have a point to say about protecting digital things in public domain. Which status lawyers say is not clarified. And there is also no activity from them to clarify it. Also initiatives like SPDX are effectively erasing public domain and forcing to replace it with licenses. My guess why is this happening is that opting out from copyright is not being paid as well as protecting the copyright. And I guess people spend big lumps of money to get education in copyright protection. I think decentralized approach can fix that.</p>

            <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/maxwell">@Maxwell</a> for the reply and thoughts. I love to hear that so many in the workstream understand and see value in the slight pivot in a few areas.</p>
<p>I will be voting Yes to budget in good faith that we can make the changes discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specifically confirming Grassroots is oriented around the highest leverage community engagement work</li>
<li>The Sales team is developing more accountability on performance, and thinking about recurring sponsorships</li>
<li>Grants Ops is continuing to scale and think longer term protocol approach (more permissionless, more runbooks, more approachable)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is what I added to my Voter’s Guide for a bit more details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am voting Yes on this budget, but it comes after a lot of dialog with PGF and the commitment to revise some of where teams are focused (over the next few months). More specifically, Grassroots has done a really strong job of bringing Public Goods into the web3 spotlight over the last year, and I would love to see them focused more on the Grants Protocol messaging now - advocating for why permissionless giving protocols are so important and how Gitcoin fits into the space as a result. Grantees are one of five constituents we likely care about. Donors, Matching Funders, GTC Token holders, our DAO/Community are the other four. Finding a narrative that speaks to the collection of constituents, and that also dovetails nicely with work MMM and DAO Ops are doing is a large opportunity (and I know other workstreams are working to advance as well).</p>
<p>I want to make sure the workstream can still take some risks in exploring better BD habits, and that they can fully adopt HubSpot. I would love to see more recurring Grants rounds from folks, and Aqueducts was one way of doing this. Once the protocol is live, it may offer a more tangible way for folks to grok who the Aqueduct can be used to fund their ecosystem.</p>

            <p>Really happy to see the thorough conversation here.</p>
<p>I share the concern mentioned by a few about the overall size of the budget, +/- double the budget of all workstreams (except for GPC, our product workstream). I think it makes sense that this is a higher budget, as you focus on partnership, but agree with what lindsey posted: clear tracking of partnerships team performance might be a good metric to have in there - and it seems this might still need to be tweaked a bit in this current proposaL</p>
<p>I personally don’t think the community/grassroots efforts need to be reduced, but I still am missing more documentation and learnings being shared from the library calls and twitter spaces, especially because the audience of the latter is so limited, and the team facilitating these efforts is pretty sizeable. It’s great to hear that this will now also be opened up to DAO Citizens and looking forward to a deep collab between Saf (DAO Ops), Maxwell and Gary (MMM) on all things Community.</p>
<p>I appreciate the reduction in budget since the previous season, but I haven’t dug deep enough in the proposal myself to confidently vote Yes on this given the total budget size and some concerns, so will go for the Abstain option for the time being.</p>

            <p>As a first-time steward, I appreciate the level of sophistication in this dialogue. I intend to vote yes on this proposal given the importance of PGF to our overall mission, but I agree with the sentiments about the overall size of the budget and would also like to see more transparency into the goals in future budgets. I’m very willing to help collaborate on that in S15 as well.</p>

            <p>Hey Lindsey, very much so actually appreciate and agree with the sentiment around transparency with sales teams. It’s been extremely recent that we’ve incorporated Hubspot into the sales process, which was brought on with the particular focuses of better documentation, transparency, and repeatability around what we’re doing.</p>
<p>With that said, I’d love to offer anyone who’s interested a read only access to our Hubspot CRM. From tracking partners, notes, meeting logs, and emails sent, I do believe it’s a sound approach to the accountability you mentioned.</p>

<p>I really do appreciate the dialog. I am really torn on how to vote for this season.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m a bit late to this conversation but very much echo Kyle’s sentiment here and the other concerns that were shared around the overall size of the PGF budget.</p>
<p>There’s been great dialogue regarding making collaboration across Grassroots, MMM, and DAOops happen around community engagement. This seems like a very positive direction to be moving in.</p>
<p>The partnerships budget is the one that I struggle the most with and where the dialogue is still lacking in building my confidence at this point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think our focus has been too spread, but I do agree that we historically haven’t done the best job of tracking goals and accountabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I shared this exact feedback during the CSDO review session and it was largely shrugged off. My experience on high performing sales teams is that they are run with extreme transparency and very clear accountability around pipelines and targets. I’m supportive of paying commiserate with performance and thus far we continue to see a lack of ability to really measure performance. Paying on a promise to deliver in future seasons and as market conditions improve does not seem like a prudent use of DAO treasury.</p>
<p>I believe, at a minimum, I would need to see a plan for how the partnerships team will be tracking performance and progress in a more transparent and accountable manner to be able to support this budget request as currently proposed.</p>

            <p>Really appreciate this clarification, Saf. I definitely agree, and see S15 as an opportunity for the three workstreams with community-based objectives to align efforts, eliminate redundancies, and ideally reduce costs substantially, during S16 and onwards.</p>
<p>Regarding the second concern, the first <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/QmQWucgbue8uemNHXTDKvvEhRxfEcoB6B6Ci51TANkKaGU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">PGF budget passed on Snapshot on August 6th, 2021</a>. The first proposal was for 45k $GTC. On August 6th, the price of $GTC was roughly $9 USD (so the rough $USD value of 45k GTC was  $405,000). You can find a detailed breakdown of the first proposal <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/public-goods-funding-workstream-budget-request/7993">here</a>. TLDR “Grassroots Efforts” was just one of four key objectives.</p>
<p>I agree it isn’t too helpful, generally, to compare anything we are doing now to what we are doing over a year ago. But it is a helpful practice, I find, to look at the beginning when we are considering the end.</p>
<p>The first objective for Grassroots efforts from July 2021 was to “increase collaboration between community members and level up new participants and increase matching pool donations.” I believe Grassroots (and PGF) has done an exceptional job staying true to this original objective.</p>
<p>The Library, also, to my knowledge emerged from this initiative where there was a <a href="https://gitcoin.co/blog/seeking-a-new-kind-of-public-good/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">request for proposals on “Seeking a New Kind of Public Good”</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All in all, it has been a bit frustrating to see everyone pushing back on Grassroots. Community is not a means to push forward protocol adoption or increase impressions on social media, community is the bedrock of trust and care within the Gitcoin ecosystem. As we shift our focus to <em>other</em> communities funding their shared needs, and I do think its critical that <em>our</em> community efforts remain well funded in this DAO.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Just want to add here that the pushback is not on community efforts - in fact you could argue that the DAO is leaning more towards community this season with at least three workstreams having very clear community-based objectives instead of just one. The concern is more the amount of money that is being spent on this specific effort, and the hope is that through more cross-stream collaboration and a better distributed community focus, we can achieve many of these same goals with a much smaller drain on our treasury.</p>
<p>Another thing I want to add: I feel the $216k number for past Grassroots budgets isn’t a very good one to anchor to. I wasn’t involved in discussing previous budgets, but I have no idea how we were spending that much on Library calls and Twitter Spaces before and how it was justified (unless there were also other activities that got discontinued/I’m not aware of).</p>

            <p>Loved the robust conversation that happened here. I’m voting yes to this budget request because I think PGF continues to drive some of our most strategic partnerships in the ecosystem with consistent success in our grants rounds.</p>
<p>With that said, I am looking forward to seeing cross-stream partnership on a DAO wide community engagement strategy. I think PGF is uniquely positioned to make this initiative a success, and I would love to hear a stronger commitment to working with DAO Ops and MMM on that initiative.</p>

<p>Given the added accountability I am inclined to vote yes, but the Grassroots work still seems aimed a bit off… I am interested in continuing to learn more though.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think that generally, to your most recent concerns Kyle around Grassroots being a bit off, I believe that S15 is in a critical period of transition for Grassroots.</p>
<p>Historically, Grassroots has been focused on creating extremely high-quality and rich community experiences through our Library and Twitter Spaces. These spaces are consistently well attended, and those who attend meaningfully and authentically participate. Our Library calls are run like intimate reading groups made up by a group of best-friends (thanks to <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/linht.tran">@linht.tran</a> and Madison), and our Twitter Spaces are run like exceptionally well-crafted podcast episodes (thanks to <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/lanitrock">@lanitrock</a> and Vermeer).</p>
<p>I’d consider our grassroots efforts in PGF to be a huge success, I think our key two faults up until this point have been:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not collaborating super closely with other workstreams</li>
<li>And not doing the best job telling our stories or re-purposing content</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>A lot of grassroots work is community engagement work, but there has historically been little to no collaboration with other community efforts in the DAO</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree with Saf that in the past we haven’t collaborated closely with other workstream’s in our efforts. But to defend Grassroots a bit, up until S14 DAO Ops and MMM weren’t principally focused on Community Efforts.</p>
<p>Given the other workstreams <em>new</em> interest in supporting community, I’m confident that Grassroots will collaborate closer with MMM and DAO Ops in S15 and beyond. The Grassroots team is highly motivated to align our efforts across the DAO. Over the past few weeks, we’ve begun aligning efforts with DAO Ops (by opening up our Library sessions to all Gitcoin Citizens) and with MMM (by continuing to explore how Twitter spaces can be leveraged to ‘spread the good word’ about grant rounds and help onboard grantees).</p>
<p>As Joe said,</p>

<p>I’m not particularily happy with the way we are blessing DAOops community experience initiative, and MMM community initiative, and deciding this is the one to cut.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I couldn’t agree more here. I find it a bit odd that folks generally feel very dismissive of the success Grassroots has had building community over the past year. Many folks seem to be over-indexing on the novel DAO Citizen initiatives, and MMM’s increased desire to focus on community as well.</p>
<p>While we begin shifting our focus as a DAO to the protocol, I’d argue that Grassroots community efforts will becoming <em>increasingly</em> critical to our success. As we begin to help other communities fund their shared needs, we might begin considering the shared needs of <em>our own community.</em> I believe that Grassroots is in the best position to lead this charge, and I believe that Grassroots is in the best position to figure out how we might, as <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle">@kyle</a> wrote <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QO9fUnWnpYRHZpk-FtZw1eta4ALlBc71_2nfzIFSZSs/edit#heading=h.ue0kc3w1sblq" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a>, “focus on helping the world understand why the Grants protocol is such a game changer.”</p>
<p>That being said, I think Grassroots will look substantially different during S16, and I think in order to get there, Grassroots will spend S15 transitioning our efforts and aligning ourselves with the DAO.</p>
<p>To address your concern around compensation, <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/safder">@safder</a>, Grassroots has a degree excellence I’m quite proud of. $100k/season is a healthy amount of funding, but as <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/fishbiscuit">@Fishbiscuit</a> wrote,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We’ve gone from 210k to 96k while starting a pivot towards grantee engagement. In fact, every season we’ve had to reorient our community efforts to galvanise our community towards more pressing issues.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>In response to <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/coachjonathan">@CoachJonathan</a>’s budget concerns, QZ also succinctly said, “Your intuition is right. It does take a lot of hours to run a good community.” Despite the expense of funding Grassroots during S15, I’m confident that we can ‘stretch our tokens’ to the fullest extent possible and produce immensely positive externalities through Grassroots community endeavors during S15. We’ll produce these positive externalities in the service of both the program and the protocol, and we’ll, as I’ve mentioned, align ourselves with other workstreams.</p>
<p>All in all, it has been a bit frustrating to see everyone pushing back on Grassroots. Community is not a means to push forward protocol adoption or increase impressions on social media, community is the bedrock of trust and care within the Gitcoin ecosystem. As we shift our focus to <em>other</em> communities funding their shared needs, and I do think its critical that <em>our</em> community efforts remain well funded in this DAO.</p>

</aside>
<p>this is a really valid assertion, if we believe we have the right community in our sessions today. I think I am envisioning a shift in who shows up and the content we present. As we shift to a protocol, I could see us shifting these space to be more focused on helping people understand why the protocol exists, how to use it fund shared needs and encouraging people to get started, experiment with the funding mechanisms, etc.</p>
<p>grantee engagement is a subset of who matters in the protocol world (ie, we need high quality grantees, but we also need ecosystems who care deeply about funding their shared needs, and to explore what those shared needs might be).</p>
<p>I am less certain we are targeting the right community on these calls (just grantees?) and that we are not aiming our sights high enough (not just grantees).</p>

<p>This seems slightly askew… though Devcon may have many potential grantees, a single event as the culmination of activity doesn’t seem aligned. Is there work planned to build this community outside of DevCon too? Our Grantees likely need more tools on platform, more info in docs and more guidance during a round - none of which are handled via support at an event.</p>

<li>for S15 as devcon is near, we intend to host a community hub for public goods as many grantees new and old will probably be at Devcon.</li>
</ol>

</aside>
<p>This is helpful, but also seems to be silod. I know the DAO Ops group is working to improve our documentation and knowledge base. Are you proposing working with them to improve the experience for Grantees there?</p>
<p>my .02 wei… The Devcon thing seems like a waste. We already have an event planned (Schelling Point), it feels silly to really budget anything extra (time or energy) to engage grantees there.</p>

<p>This has been such a huge strength to the DAO over the last year.

[S15 Proposal - INTEGRATED] PGF Budget Request
safder

            <p>I share some similar concerns to what others have raised about the amount of money that’s being spent here. I won’t cover partnerships as that’s outside my domain of expertise/I don’t have a good intuitive sense of how much “should” be spent on these activities, but feel like it’s fair for me to raise these with Grassroots spending.</p>
<p>Let me start by saying I really appreciate the work PGF Grassroots does - I’ve really enjoyed the Library sessions and Twitter Spaces that I’ve been able to attend, and I think they’re adding a lot of value to the ecosystem. I 100% believe these efforts are worth dedicating time to, especially with a new focus on planting protocol seeds.</p>
<p>My concerns are two-fold:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>I feel like close to $100k/season is a lot to be spending on these activities.</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I went through the detailed budget shared by <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/fishbiscuit">@Fishbiscuit</a> and I’m still not convinced that we need this much time and resources. I also don’t fully understand how it has been labelled, for example for the first Public Goods Library column it says :</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Sessions: 4h* 8* 40usd = 1.28k<br>
Planning: 4h* 12* 40usd = 1.92k</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are the “8” and “12” numbers and why are they different? I’m assuming this is to be read as 4h per month * 8 (what’s this?) * 40USD/hr (contributor salary). Is this consistent throughout the document?</p>
<ul>
<li>I feel like there’s a lot of overlap between the goals and efforts of the Library + Twitter Spaces, and I feel that this could be counterproductive. Why have both Library calls as well as Twitter Spaces with the goal to increase grantee engagement? Shouldn’t they have distinct goals? From what I know of community management, you want to decentralize community leadership but centralize plaftforms/channels for community as much as possible, otherwise you risk distractions and information overload of the community you are trying to engage.</li>
<li>The biggest part of this budget is the Lead salary ($36k) at a very generous rate (higher than what some workstream leads are getting paid), but it isn’t clear what the Lead’s day-to-day responsibilities are? There seems to either be a full-time or a number of part-time contributors dedicated to owning and running each initiative - what sort of leadership duties are required at a Grassroots-wide level and if these are vast, why aren’t the 6+ other contributors being empowered to take on some of these responsibilities?</li>
<li>There’s $25k dedicated to experimental grantee engagement which hasn’t been tested, adds yet another channel for communication with grantees (adds to level of overwhelm), and doesn’t seem to have been planned with any consultation with DAO Ops or MMM community building efforts - why couldn’t this be completed with the current DAO Citizens strategy being planned at DAO Ops? Which leads me to my next area of concern.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>A lot of grassroots work is community engagement work, but there has historically been little to no collaboration with other community efforts in the DAO</strong>, and there doesn’t seem like there is any plan to include this in this budget. The DAO Ops and MMM community initiatives share many of the goals as PGF Grassroots, and I’d love for us to share resources and distribute some of the important work of community engagement.</li>
</ol>
<p>Just want to close by saying that again, I really appreciate the work that PGF has done so far for the DAO, and couldn’t think any higher of this team. That being said, other workstreams have really taken the “leaner DAO” approach very seriously, often in ways that hasn’t been very pleasant and has required us all to reprioritize and hold each other to higher levels of accountability. I’m just not seeing the same sentiment in this proposal.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this is extra important as we are moving into the space of celebrity involvement and more non web3 brands (Serena Ventures, Schmidt Futures, Kimbal Musk etc). This will mean more scrutiny of our user experience and how we support our users. Our brand should be associated with positive web3 experience so our partners are happy to continue sponsoring rounds and we can leverage their positive response to bring on more high profile partners.</p>
<p>I agree we shouldn’t prioritize spending money or developer time on the existing platform but lets not conflate that with the efforts that are needed to continue to successfully build partnership and to run increasingly effective grants rounds.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree with this sentiment. I’m not particularily happy with the way we are blessing DAOops community experience initiative, and MMM community initiative, and deciding this is the one to cut.</p>
<p>I’d really like to see them all merged under a leader with a vision for our future community engagement combined with a co-lead who has the operational chops to execute. (I am not trying to express an opinion here about whether or not people currently leading these initiatives should or shouldn’t be that leader, only to express a desire for a thoughtful conversation around how we structure it going forward.)</p>
<p>I do feel like there is overlap, but from my perspective, I don’t think it is being thoughtfully resolved.</p>

<p>Couldn’t agree more. We really need to be investing in subDAOs and microservice DAOs that are born out of our efforts. Our business plan is not yet strong and this kind of experimentation with funds to come with it is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>I’d support this budget simply based on the funding partnerships has brought in to date.</p>

<p>Feels to me like much of what we are doing in multiple workstreams is grassroots organizing. Its really a core part of the DNA of any public goods focused organization. Perhaps what is needed is more organic cross work stream coordination. There are some epic talented people in each of these work streams. It would be a shame to lose the momentum that is growing. Lets make sure <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/lanitrock">@lanitrock</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/fishbiscuit">@Fishbiscuit</a> and other epic team members know they are valued and appreciated.</p>
