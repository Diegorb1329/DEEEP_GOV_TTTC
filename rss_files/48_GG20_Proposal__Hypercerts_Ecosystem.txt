GG20 Proposal: Hypercerts Ecosystem
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-proposal-hypercerts-ecosystem/18319
    ### 1. Name (or Topic/Theme) of Proposed Round

Hypercerts Ecosystem

### 2. How many times has this round been run during a Gitcoin Grants round?

This is the first time that we want to run a round for the hypercerts ecosystem. The Hypercerts Foundation has been a project in GG19.

### 3. How big is your team that will run this round? Who is your team?

- Holke Brammer, Hypercerts Foundation ([twitter](https://twitter.com/holkeb), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hbrammer/))
- Jon Ruth, CCN & Spark ([twitter](https://twitter.com/jhruth), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonruth/))
- David Mortech, ETHSafari & Greenpill Kenya ([twitter](https://twitter.com/morte_chs))

### 4. How does this round align with Gitcoinâ€™s mission and essential intents?

The mission of the Hypercerts Foundation is to advance the development and adoption of open-source protocols for funding and rewarding positive impact. Which aligns directly with Gitcoinâ€™s mission of creating technologies and opportunities that enable communities to build, fund and empower their ecosystems.

Our technology, the hypercerts protocol and stack, integrates with Gitcoin's technology stack by improving the recognition, evaluation, and reward of positive impacts. We are conducting this round for the hypercerts ecosystem to empower and support projects that build on the hypercerts primitives. By increasing the adoption of hypercerts across funding mechanisms and platforms, we aim to transform isolated platforms into interconnected, dynamic funding networks.

### 5. What do you anticipate the size of the matching pool will be (either fundraised from partners, raised independently through your connections or combination of both)

We are targeting 25k USD to be raised by this team and have already a commitment of 10k USD. We would love to match it with another 25k USD from the GG20 matching fund.

### 6. Please describe the eligibility criteria you envision for this proposed round.

  1. Project must build upon the hypercerts protocol or be a pilot use case for new functionalities. Projects that merely use hypercerts without extending its functionality or enabling its use by others are not eligible.
  2. Project must be 3 months old and the project must demonstrate some tangible progress; just proposing an idea to utilize the hypercerts protocol will not meet the eligibility criteria.
  3. Projects must comply with Gitcoin core rules and eligibility.

Eligible projects include those that integrate hypercerts into existing funding platformsâ€”similar to the hypercerts integration with Gitcoinâ€”or develop new applications like prize competitions leveraging the hypercerts infrastructure.

### 7. How large is your community approximately?
Community of the Hypercerts Foundation: Telegram 500+ members, Twitter 3000+ followers.

Hypercerts Foundation is also part of the Protocol Labs Network (PLN) and the Funding the Commons community as hypercerts were first developed as a research project at Protocol Labs in collaboration with Kevin Owocki and Supermodular. Hence, our extended community includes for instance the 130K twitter followers of Protocol Labs.

### 8. What type of projects would you like to fund?

As described in the eligibility criteria section, we are most excited for projects

  1. that integrate hypercerts into existing funding platformsâ€”similar to the hypercerts integration with Gitcoin,
  2. that develop new applications like prize competitions leveraging the hypercerts infrastructure,
  3. that build tooling to extent the functionality for multiple integrations and applications, such as Deresy to coordinate evaluators, or
  4. that are tangible use cases piloting new functionalities, e.g. implementing retroactive funding rounds with hypercerts or using hyperboards.

These are the projects that bring hypercerts into multiple impact domains and together will create the interconnected, dynamic funding networks that we envision.

### 9. Approximately how many grantees do you believe will be eligible to apply to this round.
10-15 projects (such as Yeeter, greenpill.network, da0, Sovereign Nature Initiative, VoiceDeck, Deresy, etc.). We would rather have a small, high-quality round than a very broad round.

### 10. Impact Assessment: If and how do you intend to assess grantee impact over successive rounds? This could include, but is not limited to Hypercerts, GAP, Deresy, etc.

Hypercerts and Deresy, especially since the core team members will be part of this community round. We have not designed the specifics but anticipate these two primitives will be used as a part of the round.

### 11. Anything else community members should focus when voting

We are excited to build the hypercerts ecosystem in close collaboration with the Gitcoin community. We canâ€™t wait for Grants Stack v2 to launch on Allo v2 and look forward to experimenting with integrating Hypercerts into the new platform.

            <p>Super happy to see Hypercerts apply to run a round! Iâ€™m hopeful this move will help grow the Hypercerts ecosystem to more projects.</p>
<p>I am a council member deciding on the matching fund each community round receives, but I will have to abstain from this application since my project VoiceDeck will be applying under the round.</p>
