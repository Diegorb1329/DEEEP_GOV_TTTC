### Information on Grant Ships

Applications, reviewing and voting will take place on the Grant Ships platform.

Grant Ships is an evolutionary grants framework designed to refine and advance best practices through a dynamic mix of competition, collaboration, and skill-sharing among grant programs. Selected grant programs — known as "Ships" — innovate and engage in a public arena, where they are observed and evaluated by the community and/or designated judges. These assessments set each Ship’s starting position for the next round, rewarding top performers and allowing new Ships to join. This iterative cycle drives continuous innovation, leading to ever-improving strategies and outcomes.

Watch a [Youtube short from a Green Pill](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/C1Ntm7pBTUw) appearance for more info.

Once applications are live, we will release further instructions and support on how to apply.

### Before the Round

* Preparation:
  * Ensure dedicated owners are driving the responsibilities forward. For smaller first-time rounds, these tasks may fall on the experienced Round Operator.
  * Use Gitcoin’s AI [Checker](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-checker/17292) tool for application reviews and consider building a small team to assist the Round Operator.
  * Form an Advisory Team of committed community stakeholders to help generate ideas, gather feedback, and provide support throughout the round.
  * Go through the [Gitcoin Grants Canvas](https://grantscanvas.gitcoin.co/) to prepare your round with its goals, mission, and design.
  * Familiarize yourself with the [details of operating and running a round](https://roundoperations.gitcoin.co/round-operations) before considering applying.
* Round Eligibility Document:
  * Create an eligibility criteria document for project acceptance before fundraising and recruiting grantees to ensure clarity on what qualifies. While this can evolve if needed, the first version should be created before going out and fundraising and recruiting grantees so that it is clear to parties [what is eligible & what isn’t for the round.](https://roundoperations.gitcoin.co/round-operations/eligibility-and-review/eligibility-process)
* Mission-Critical Areas:
  * Allocate or raise funds for the matching pool.
  * Recruit and onboard grantees using guidance from the Gitcoin Grants Stack tools.

### During the Round

* Marketing:
  * Promote the round effectively. Reminder: Gitcoin merely supports marketing efforts during a round. All Community Rounds are responsible for their own outreach & marketing.
* Compliance:
  * Undergo KYC if receiving matching funds from Gitcoin. As per Gitcoin’s policy, for any funds +$15k we distribute, parties need to undergo KYC.
* Support:
  * Support grantees and donors, with dedicated grantee portals, Office Hours, onboarding documentation, etc. Note: if needed, Gitcoin may advise.

### After the Round

* Payouts:
  * Oversee the payout and KYC process (if required) to ensure smooth facilitation and address any issues.
  * Matching funds must be released within 4 weeks of the round ending; delays may result in ineligibility for future rounds.
* Retrospective:
  * Conduct a retrospective to assess what worked and what can be improved, and share feedback with Gitcoin.
* Ongoing Support:
  * Continue communication with grantees as needed.

REMINDER: This is the minimum for a viable round. [The runbook provided to Round Operators](https://roundoperations.gitcoin.co/round-operations) will include much more information about how to run the best possible round.

            <p>Love the idea, the only thing that makes me caution is the possibility of matching Paypal donations with the matching pool. Please clarify this issue when submitting the proposal. As you might know the use of Paypal in the global south is but a fraction of the use in the global north and that puts us in a disadvantaged position.</p>

<p>Also excited to announce that <a href="https://www.celopg.eco/">CeloPG</a> is planning a ‘<strong>matching on matching</strong>’ program with up to $25k available across GG23 community rounds that choose to run on Celo and distribute payouts in USDGLO.</p>

<p>love this!</p>
<p>i will also be matching rounds that are related to ethereum localism and localist public goods funding.  details <a href="https://x.com/owocki/status/1881137888248599004">here</a>.</p>

<p>one thing we might want to consider if we want to encourage more matching on matching is integrating multiple matching funders into one round application flow<br>
eg insetad of person X applying to gitcoin, then celo, then owocki yolo funds… allow them to apply to all possible matchers in one fell swoop.</p>
