GG20 OSS Funding Rounds & Eligibility Criteria
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-oss-funding-rounds-eligibility-criteria/18393
    The Gitcoin Grants Program champions the development of Open-Source Software (OSS) across the wider Web3 ecosystem. 

Our eligibility criteria aims to ensure that all participating grantees adhere to the highest standards of ethical conduct, community values, and the ethos of OSS. This framework is designed to nurture innovation and facilitate meaningful contributions to the open-source community.

The eligibility criteria for the upcoming GG20 are as follows:

#### Ethical and Community Standards

- **No Hateful Content:** We firmly stand against discrimination and hate speech.
- **Deceiving Users:** Prohibited is any content that could harm users or lead to unintended consequences.
- **Falsification:** Attempts to falsify contributions, including Sybil attacks or other manipulative practices, are strictly banned.
- **Fraud & Impersonation:** Projects must accurately represent their affiliation and intentions to maintain transparency and trust.
- **[No Quid Pro Quo & Bribery](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-grants/general-questions/what-is-our-quid-pro-quo-policy):** Incentives in exchange for donations are disallowed, maintaining the integrity of the contribution process.
- **Advertising Restrictions:** Utilizing grants for direct promotional activities or sales is prohibited.
- **Funding Caps:** Projects with significant external funding may be reconsidered to ensure equitable distribution of resources.
- **Legal Compliance:** Mandatory is the adherence to all applicable laws and regulations for participation.

#### Open-Source Principles and Project Activity

- **Licensing Requirement:** Projects must be fully open source, offering "source available" for anyone to fork, modify, and redistribute, embodying the essence of open-source collaboration.
- **Activity Metrics:** Demonstrated established and ongoing development activity as evidenced by GitHub commit history.

This eligibility framework is devised to ensure that the projects we support are aligned with the foundational values of the Gitcoin Grants Program and actively contribute to the growth and integrity of the OSS ecosystem. Projects that violate these guidelines will face disqualification from consideration, underscoring our dedication to maintaining the highest standards of ethical conduct and community engagement.

Projects fulfilling the licensing requirements and displaying sufficient activity metrics will be directly approved. Those partially meeting these standards will be subject to a manual review process, while projects failing to satisfy any of the criteria will be deemed ineligible.

### OSS Rounds

When applications open, the program will feature four rounds within Grants Stack. Each round will feature eligibility requirements tailored to that segment's unique objectives and needs. These include the following:

- Hackathon Alumni
- dApps & Apps
- Web3 Infrastructure
- Developer Tooling and Libraries

The allocations for the rounds are as follows:

* Hackathon Alumni: $100K
* dApps & Apps: $300K
* Web3 Infrastructure: $300K
* Developer Tooling and Libraries: $300K

Applicants are limited to submitting their projects for a single round of funding. It is recommended that grantees choose the round that most closely matches their project's primary mission and goals. By doing so, we aim to provide focused and impactful support and ensure resources are directed where they can achieve the greatest effect.

#### Hackathon Alumni

### Evaluation Process

Our evaluation process combines quantitative measures, such as adherence to open-source licensing and active development indicators, with qualitative assessments, including the project's contribution to the OSS ecosystem, community engagement, and innovation.

### Conclusion

By establishing clear criteria and specific targets for each funding round, the GG20 OSS funding initiative aims to foster innovation, enhance community engagement, and promote a transparent and inclusive selection process across the OSS ecosystem. This approach ensures support for diverse projects, contributing to the growth and sustainability of open-source and Web3 technologies.

            <p>Love these categories, especially how projects that were earlier in community rounds but have an active dapp under development can still be part of it. I expect evaluation will be much more streamlined going ahead since GitHub is the single source of truth for whether a project is active or not.</p>
<p>Look forward to the round and these changes, especially how Allo V2 is going to perform</p>

<p>When it was announced that there was not any community rounds involved in GG20 we weren’t sure if we were going to participate. It looks like we are eligible for this category so we will apply for this round. Honestly, I think we may have just skipped over this part when reading over the announcement initially.</p>
<p>This may be an interesting dynamic to participate in this round during the next month of work for us that lays ahead.<br>

            <p>Thanks for this!</p>
<p>To answer your question, our eligibility criteria are designed to target projects that embrace an open-source ethos of building in public for the entire journey.  When projects do most of their work in private repos, it is difficult to determine if they are legitimate or if they forked someone else’s work and just uploaded it to a public repo to try to get a grant.</p>
<p>In cases where it is hard to establish a project’s OSS track record, we will need a more thorough review to determine if it meets the spirit of the round.</p>

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/sov">@Sov</a> thanks for laying this out so clearly.</p>
<p>We have made all our smart contracts governing $EARTH and a couple others open source in our public repo but the day to day commits were not made on the same repo, we built and tested it offline before putting it up and deploying.</p>
<p>Would this be a concern while applying for OSS ?</p>

            <p>as a former operator I’d ask if the QPQ rules are strict or can be intepreted different by its spirit?</p>
<p>we actually encountered many projects say they’d give back to their supporters and donors in the future (which seems legitimate argument) , without explicitly saying there will be any return for donation, however in many cases it just serve as a disguise for QPQ - especially for media and education projects</p>

            <p>Thanks for your feedback on this.  I wanted to address each point with our reasoning:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make sure all the projects are already shipped:</strong> We want to support projects across all stages of development, from inception to launch. This inclusivity allows us to nurture ideas that could transform the ecosystem, even if they haven’t shipped yet.</li>
<li><strong>Drive user growth to existing live products:</strong> While we aim to direct attention to live projects, our broader goal encompasses fostering the entire development lifecycle, including the phases leading up to launch. This approach helps ensure that projects are well-equipped to engage users and drive growth effectively when projects go live.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me know if any follow on questions, thanks again!</p>

            <p>Just a suggestion: If possible we should have different tracks for applications / SDKs that are currently live (atleast for Applications) and the ones that are under construction. The not live ones (or under construction status ones) can be a part of Hackathon Track.</p>
<p>The idea is to,</p>

<li>Make sure all the projects are already shipped.</li>

GG20 OSS Funding Rounds & Eligibility Criteria
Sov

            <p>The Gitcoin Grants Program champions the development of Open-Source Software (OSS) across the wider Web3 ecosystem.</p>
<p>Our eligibility criteria aims to ensure that all participating grantees adhere to the highest standards of ethical conduct, community values, and the ethos of OSS. This framework is designed to nurture innovation and facilitate meaningful contributions to the open-source community.</p>
<p>The eligibility criteria for the upcoming GG20 are as follows:</p>
<h4><a name="ethical-and-community-standards-1" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#ethical-and-community-standards-1"></a>Ethical and Community Standards</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Hateful Content:</strong> We firmly stand against discrimination and hate speech.</li>
