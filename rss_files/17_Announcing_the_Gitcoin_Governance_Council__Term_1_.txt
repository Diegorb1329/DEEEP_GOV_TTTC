    # Announcing the Gitcoin Governance Council: Term 1 (Q1â€“Q2 2025)

## TL;DR

We're launching the Gitcoin Governance Council to bring more structure, accountability, and decentralization to governance. The council will oversee key governance processes, facilitate decision-making, and drive community participation. The first term runs until the end of Q2 2025, at which point we will evaluate, iterate, and refine the structure based on community feedback.

## What is the Gitcoin Governance Council?

The Governance Council is a structured group of community-elected and appointed stewards who will play a key role in improving governance efficiency, decision-making, and engagement. The goal is to transition governance from chaos to clarity by introducing accountability, clearer delegation, and strategic oversight while keeping decision-making as decentralized and transparent as possible.

### Council Responsibilities

The councilâ€™s primary responsibilities include:

* Facilitating governance processes â€“ ensuring smooth proposal reviews, discussions, and voting.
* Supporting decentralization efforts â€“ increasing community-led governance participation.
* Stewarding the DAO Constitution â€“ guiding the ratification and implementation process.
* Enhancing transparency â€“ publishing quarterly governance updates and retrospectives.

## Term 1: Selected Council Members

For this first term (Q1â€“Q2 2025), the following individuals have been selected based on their contributions, expertise, and governance experience (in no particular order):

1. Wasabi (@wasabi)
2. Ivan Molto (@ivanmolto)
3. SEEDGov (@SEEDGov)
4. PGov (@PGov)
5. Tane (@Tane)

The council's first act was to vote on & approve community rounds for GG23, the results of which can be found [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg23-community-rounds-announced/20127).

## Delegation & Authority

The council will:

* Serve as a trusted governance facilitator, ensuring that proposals are clear, actionable, and aligned with Gitcoinâ€™s long-term vision.
* Guide but not control â€“ their role is to enable participation, not dictate decisions.
* Be accountable to the community, with all actions tracked and transparently reported.

Matching Pool Signers:

Because of our dedication and emphasis on the importance of decentralizing fund management to empower community members, we routinely rotate community signers on the Matching Pool, gitcoin.eth. In September, we [ratified a rotation](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-updating-community-multisig-signers-on-gitcoin-eth/19337), and weâ€™ll be updating this rotation again including members from the elected council. Signers from the council will be as follows:

@wasabi
@IvanMolto
@SEEDGov

Zer8 will be removed from signing.

## Evaluation & Next Steps (End of Q2 2025 Review)

At the end of Q2 2025, we will:

* Review the councilâ€™s impact and effectiveness â€“ assessing progress on governance participation, proposal quality, and community engagement.
* Gather community feedback â€“ via discussions, surveys, and governance calls.
* Refine or restructure if needed â€“ ensuring that the governance framework evolves to best serve Gitcoinâ€™s long-term decentralization goals.

## How You Can Get Involved

* Join the conversation! â€“ Share thoughts, feedback, and ideas on the governance forum
* Propose improvements! â€“ Have suggestions for making governance better? Drop them in an ideas post
* Participate in governance! â€“ Submit and engage with community-led proposals.
