# 2022/5/30 Update

## Highlights

* The Passport is ~93% of our MVP Goal, with a week left on our timeline (same for the other goal of using Passport for Trust Bonus in GR14); this means we have one last stamp to finish and a few minor UI changes. While we're on course to complete, ideally, we would have spent about 1-2 weeks sooner to give us plenty of time to test everything. Next week, we will evaluate our product, processes, support, et cetera, to make sure it's ready to run on GR14. I'll be asking people to jump in, create Passports, connect them to their profile on Gitcoin, and give feedback. On Wed (June 1st), we'll decide whether we're confident about running Passport for GR14. So far, things look good, but there are very tight timeframes here.
* The Grants Hub will be dev-complete with Grant Hub by Friday, 6/3. We are about 60% to hitting our MVP milestone with this week's progress. Our goal is to have Grant Hub production-ready **by July 1st, 2022**, in time for the GR14 claims period, where we will prompt grant owners to migrate their grants from cGrants to Grant Hub.
* The Round Manager / Explorer team spent a significant chunk of our team time prepping cGrants for GR14, but we have outlined our Steel Thread for Round Manager and begun shipping core pieces of our development foundation!

            <p>Thanks leon!  I left some comments in the discord demo channels.</p>
<p>For others in the DAO - I‚Äôd be curious if these weekly G2.0 updates are useful.   What would have to be true for these updates to be a focal point upon which the DAO rallies around G2.0?</p>
