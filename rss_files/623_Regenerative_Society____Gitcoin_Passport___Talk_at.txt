Regenerative Society // Gitcoin Passport - Talk at ETHcc
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/regenerative-society-gitcoin-passport-talk-at-ethcc/11116
    Hi all,

At [ETHCC](https://ethcc.io/) this year, I will giving a talk entitled "Regenerative Society".  It is scheduled on Day 1: July 19th, at 10:30 in the room called : Main Stage.

The objective of the talk is to outline a vision for what happens when we are all coordinating on top of a decentralized society-like identity infrastructure, and introduce Gitcoin Passport as a tool for aggregating credentials (at first, for sybil resistance - but ppl could fork it + create their own scoring algorithms for other things).  The call to action is to use Passport in your own dApp.

Here are the first two slides of the talk.
