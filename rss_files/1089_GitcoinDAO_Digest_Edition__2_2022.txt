* It‚Äôs all coordination ‚Äî always had been. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre building the [Coordination.Party Toolkit](https://coordination.party/). Each decentralized Toolkit app helps DAOs recruit, recognize, reward, or retain contributors. For example Recuriter.Party is a decentralized LinkedIn where job seekers get paid when recruiters access their profile. And Pay.Party allows teams to allocate a budget in a democratic way. We‚Äôre building coordination tools for GitcoinDAO and beyond. Keep track of our weekly progress [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfbOba7iD19HyrB9QbV6Uww).

### üåê [Decentralize Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Decentralize-Gitcoin-cd6d46d3784244e4ae7a68b108bb9495)

* Payouts for dGrants Gitcoin Building Gitcoin Grant Round have been issued.

* Research for dGrants protocol V1 proposal is in progress, the research include:

### üíô [Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Fraud-Detection-Defense-2bde13c0b8e74fda81435d94e49e2703)

* We are updating the FDD Operating System, including:
  * Making sure contributors understand the How, What, When, and Why of getting paid
  * Ensuring FDD delivery of mandate via proper success metrics for sybil, grants, and research
  * Proper access control for all documentation and project management
  * Contributors know which meetings to attend, where information and conversation are being held and proper review cadence
  * A clear system for making decisions and adding contributors

* Q1 Outcomes for Sybil Defense are:
  * GitcoinDAO runs the ASOP end-to-end. Blockscience [scope](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rfXHYbCoXcErmJtED_W0JhS-6W3TvFEUNNltlOaM9_o/edit?usp=sharing) reduced and redirected.
  * Alignment on a single high-quality codebase and single source of truth for documentation
  * Clearly define the data needing access control vs what can be opened up
  * A basic app for human evaluations is built, used, and analyzed after the round
  * Gain commitments and requirements for participation in a Sybil Detection data storage

<li>It‚Äôs all coordination ‚Äî always had been. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre building the <a href="https://coordination.party/">Coordination.Party Toolkit</a>. Each decentralized Toolkit app helps DAOs recruit, recognize, reward, or retain contributors. For example Recuriter.Party is a decentralized LinkedIn where job seekers get paid when recruiters access their profile. And Pay.Party allows teams to allocate a budget in a democratic way. We‚Äôre building coordination tools for GitcoinDAO and beyond. Keep track of our weekly progress <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfbOba7iD19HyrB9QbV6Uww">here</a>.</li>

<li>Ensuring FDD delivery of mandate via proper success metrics for sybil, grants, and research</li>
<li>Proper access control for all documentation and project management</li>
<li>Contributors know which meetings to attend, where information and conversation are being held and proper review cadence</li>
<li>A clear system for making decisions and adding contributors</li>

<p>Q1 Outcomes for Sybil Defense are:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitcoinDAO runs the ASOP end-to-end. Blockscience <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rfXHYbCoXcErmJtED_W0JhS-6W3TvFEUNNltlOaM9_o/edit?usp=sharing">scope</a> reduced and redirected.</li>
<li>Alignment on a single high-quality codebase and single source of truth for documentation</li>
<li>Clearly define the data needing access control vs what can be opened up</li>
<li>A basic app for human evaluations is built, used, and analyzed after the round</li>
<li>Gain commitments and requirements for participation in a Sybil Detection data storage</li>
