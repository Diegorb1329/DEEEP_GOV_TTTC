            <p>priceless!! I was going to ask about it.<br>
Happy to receive so many valuable resources.<br>
I want to dig into this documentation before I join the next session/group task force.</p>
<p>For the records, I had a good conversation with the Proof of Humanity team who is also in close collab with BrightID. this is one of the greatest combined efforts to solve the issue.<br>
Iâ€™m happy to burn some neurons together with the team <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
