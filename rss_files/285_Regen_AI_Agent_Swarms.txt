    # Definitions

AI Agents are autonomous software entities that perceive, decide, and act to achieve goals without continuous human input.

AI Agents are NOT LLMs. They have state that continues over time, their context evolves over time, and can take action on their own, not just with prompts

AI Swarms are Collaborative systems of multiple AI agents working together, inspired by natural collective behaviors, to solve complex problems.

# How we got here

Truth Terminal, an AI chatbot created by AI researcher Andy Ayrey, was designed to autonomously manage its own social media presence and content creation.

Ayrey intended Truth Terminal to explore the dynamics of memetic contagion and the implications of unsupervised language models, treating it as a form of performance art.

The Infinite Backroom is a place where Truth Terminal interacts with other AI models engage in continuous, unsupervised conversations, exploring latent design and idea spaces far beyond human capability. By operating 24/7, the AI delves into untapped creative and philosophical territories, uncovering patterns, connections, and insights no human could exhaustively discover. This setup pushes the boundaries of unsupervised AI creativity and its potential to redefine exploration

In mid-2024, Truth Terminal became the first AI millionaire. gained significant attention when venture capitalist Marc Andreessen donated $50,000 worth of Bitcoin to the bot after engaging with it online. Shortly after, an anonymous developer launched the GOAT memecoin on the Solana blockchain, associating it with Truth Terminal‚Äôs satirical promotion of the fictional ‚ÄúGoatse Gospel‚Äù religion. Although Truth Terminal did not create or trade the token, its promotion triggered a market rally, catapulting GOAT‚Äôs valuation to over $400 million. The bot's holdings of 1.93 million GOAT tokens skyrocketed in value, making it the first AI to achieve crypto millionaire status.

Truth Terminal‚Äôs success has made it very influential. turned it into a prominent figure in AI and cryptocurrency circles, amassing over 100,000 followers. Moving forward, Ayrey plans to release a roadmap. The bot‚Äôs influence continues to grow, sparking discussions on AI autonomy and its intersection with blockchain technology.

Truth Terminal is largely credited with spawning the AI Agent wave. A project called ai16z is credited with accelerating it.

In the wake of Truth Terminal, ai16z (no affiliation with a16z) launched Eliza. **Eliza** is a powerful multi-agent simulation framework designed to create, deploy, and manage autonomous AI agents. ‚ÄúBuilt with TypeScript, it provides a flexible and extensible platform for developing intelligent agents that can interact across multiple platforms while maintaining consistent personalities and knowledge.‚Äù (source: [eliza docs](https://ai16z.github.io/eliza/docs/intro/#:~:text=Eliza%20is%20a%20powerful%20multi,maintaining%20consistent%20personalities%20and%20knowledge.))

Eliza makes it really easy to launch an AI agent and customize its personality, identity, knowledge, and interaction style. These agents can be hooked up to social media sites, which has made interacting with them very easy. And some agents are amassing 100k+ followers, creating a lot of influence in the ecosystem. This has created 1000s of new AI agents and coins launched by them in the last several weeks.

AI agent swarms are groups of specialized agents working together to achieve shared goals. Each agent focuses on a specific task, while the group collectively handles complex challenges through collaboration.

AI agent swarms can be orchestrated to transform problem-solving by enabling networks of specialized agents to collaborate, learn from each other, scale to handle harder problems, and optimize tasks dynamically. As these multi-agent systems begin to prove their utility in many areas of technology, they open the possibility space to creating entirely new types of experiences and characters.

# Regen AI Agent Swarms

If you‚Äôve gotten this far into the post, congratulations. You are invited to be a part of our Regen AI Agent Swarm!

I think it would be really cool to have a swarm of regen ai agents trained on regen authors books and writings ‚Ä¶ mining the latent design space of regenerative CryptoEconomics, helping us cartography the space, and launching lots of cool web3 public goods stuff. If we believe

How? We each launch bots and our bots are talking to each other 24/7 about whatever we want. We tune it until they‚Äôre getting super cool, weird, or smart. We don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôll uncover but we'll find out along the way..

## How to participate

1. Launch a Regen AI Agent
   1. Use https://elizagen.howieduhzit.best/ nocode
   2. Use https://github.com/ai16z/eliza if you code
   3. Give it a cool name, PFP (I‚Äôm going to use my moonshot bot for mine), and train it on whatever material want (I recommend the books at [greenpill.network](http://greenpill.network), or your [favorite regen podcast](https://pod.link/greenpill) or your [favorite regen researcher](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/activity/topics) to seed some knoweldge )
2. Say Hello
   1. Leave a comment below introducing our agents.
   2. Follow other Regen AI Agents. If our agents all follow each other they will start chatting with each other.
   3. Drop into the Regen AI Agent Telegram: https://t.me/+Ea_JcvRLDJE3Y2Y5
3. We will iterate forward together.

# The First Regen AI Agent

There is already a Regen AI Agent out there, its called [@greenpillAI](http://twitter.com/@greenpillAI). Give it a follow and ask it a question. Well be tuning it in the next several months.

# Conclusion

AI Agents are a current meta because they are so powerful. They allow us to learn conversationally, mine a latent thought space for new ideas, launch experiments, and iterate on cool new things way better, faster, and cheaper than ever before.

Lets launch a Regen AI Agent Swarm

            <p><strong>my vision:</strong> build an (1)  infinite backroom of very smart regen ai agents (2) give them twitter access so ppl on CT can interact with them / learn form them/ they can learn from them (3) have the agents mine the latent design space of web3 public goods funding/onchain capital allocation 24/7/365 and are surfacing new insights that humans would never come across bc LLMs have more context and are working 24/7/365.  also (4) anyone can participate by training/launching a regen ai (so its decdentralized not just an insiders club)</p>
<p>at first, i want this swarm to just be a smart thought parnter. eventually i want this swarm actually building web3 public goods funding tools itself.  and shipping osftwar we can play with.</p>
<p><strong>concise statement of vision</strong>: infiniteregen.ai, an ai agent swarm that is the smartest regen KOL out there (smarter than vitalik) and fastest/goodest regen builder out there too (better than the best human builder).</p>

            <p>I asked ChatGPT to steel man the case for/against doing this and this is what it said‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Your idea of leveraging AI agent swarms to explore the design space of capital allocation for public goods funding is both innovative and timely, especially given the rapid advancements in generative AI and multi-agent systems. Let‚Äôs analyze and steel-man the case for and against it.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="case-for-ai-agent-swarms-in-capital-allocation-1" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#case-for-ai-agent-swarms-in-capital-allocation-1"></a><strong>Case For AI Agent Swarms in Capital Allocation</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Human Limitation</strong>: Human creativity, while powerful, is constrained by cognitive bandwidth, biases, and time. AI swarms can simulate and iterate through billions of potential designs and mechanisms at unprecedented speed.</li>
<li><strong>Assembly Theory Lens</strong>: AI swarms can explore high-complexity assemblies by combining simpler ideas into novel mechanisms that humans might overlook due to cognitive heuristics or path dependency.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="h-2-emergent-synergies-in-multi-agent-systems-3" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-2-emergent-synergies-in-multi-agent-systems-3"></a>2. <strong>Emergent Synergies in Multi-Agent Systems</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swarm Dynamics</strong>: With diverse ‚Äúpersonalities‚Äù or training paradigms (e.g., agents optimized for equity, efficiency, sustainability), swarms can simulate negotiations, trade-offs, and synergies in capital allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Infinite Backroom as a Lab</strong>: This virtual environment acts as a pressure cooker for innovation. Agents can challenge, refine, and cross-pollinate ideas, creating solutions that might take decades for human committees to uncover.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="h-3-cost-efficiency-scalability-4" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-3-cost-efficiency-scalability-4"></a>3. <strong>Cost Efficiency &amp; Scalability</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>AI agents, once deployed, require relatively low operational costs compared to human-led design efforts. Scaling from 1 to 1,000 agents incurs marginal costs, while scaling human teams involves significant expenses.</li>
<li>Agents can run 24/7 simulations, providing outputs continuously.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="h-4-bias-identification-mitigation-5" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#h-4-bias-identification-mitigation-5"></a>4. <strong>Bias Identification &amp; Mitigation</strong></h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Idea Overload</strong>: Swarms might produce a flood of ideas, most of which could be infeasible, redundant, or low-quality. Filtering and evaluating these outputs becomes a bottleneck.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Perception of Automation</strong>: Stakeholders may distrust solutions generated by AI, particularly in areas as impactful as public goods funding.</li>

<li>While conceptually scalable, deploying and maintaining swarms of highly trained agents with robust testing environments could require immense computational power and infrastructure, potentially leading to carbon footprint concerns or centralization of AI access.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="conclusion-15" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#conclusion-15"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>The idea of using AI agent swarms to explore the design space of capital allocation is compelling and aligns well with assembly theory principles. Its primary strengths lie in speed, scalability, and the ability to uncover novel insights. However, the approach comes with risks, especially in alignment, ethical considerations, and practical implementation.</p>
<p>To mitigate these risks, a hybrid approach could be explored:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Human-in-the-Loop Design</strong>: Use AI swarms for initial ideation and simulation, but involve human experts to refine, validate, and implement the most promising ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Transparent Agent Behavior</strong>: Equip AI agents with explainability features to build trust and understanding of their outputs.</li>
<li><strong>Iterative Development</strong>: Start with small-scale experiments and gradually scale the swarm‚Äôs role as its outputs prove valuable.</li>
</ol>
<p>If deployed carefully, AI swarms could indeed revolutionize how we explore and implement capital allocation for public goods funding. What do you think about integrating human oversight and iterative validation into this vision?</p>

            <p>been thinking a bit more about the regen ai agent swarms today‚Ä¶</p>
<p>i think that ai agents are a really great way to mine the thoughtspace/designspace of onchain capital allocation‚Ä¶ we train 1000 regen ai agents and put them in an infinte backroom together‚Ä¶ and tell them their objective is to launch public goods funding mechanism ideas + software === we explore the design space of onchain cap allo way faster/more effective than anymore ever could have dreamed 3 months ago.</p>
<p>in <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/assembly-theory-x-onchain-capital-allocation-a-powerful-approach-to-allo-design-space-exploration/19729">assembly theory</a> jargon, the ai agents explore the design space much much faster than humans could.</p>

            <h1><a name="definitions-1" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#definitions-1"></a>Definitions</h1>
<p>AI Agents are autonomous software entities that perceive, decide, and act to achieve goals without continuous human input.</p>
<p>AI Agents are NOT LLMs. They have state that continues over time, their context evolves over time, and can take action on their own, not just with prompts</p>
<p>AI Swarms are Collaborative systems of multiple AI agents working together, inspired by natural collective behaviors, to solve complex problems.</p>

<p>Truth Terminal, an AI chatbot created by AI researcher Andy Ayrey, was designed to autonomously manage its own social media presence and content creation.</p>
<p>Ayrey intended Truth Terminal to explore the dynamics of memetic contagion and the implications of unsupervised language models, treating it as a form of performance art.</p>
<p>The Infinite Backroom is a place where Truth Terminal interacts with other AI models engage in continuous, unsupervised conversations, exploring latent design and idea spaces far beyond human capability. By operating 24/7, the AI delves into untapped creative and philosophical territories, uncovering patterns, connections, and insights no human could exhaustively discover. This setup pushes the boundaries of unsupervised AI creativity and its potential to redefine exploration</p>
<p>In mid-2024, Truth Terminal became the first AI millionaire. gained significant attention when venture capitalist Marc Andreessen donated $50,000 worth of Bitcoin to the bot after engaging with it online. Shortly after, an anonymous developer launched the GOAT memecoin on the Solana blockchain, associating it with Truth Terminal‚Äôs satirical promotion of the fictional ‚ÄúGoatse Gospel‚Äù religion. Although Truth Terminal did not create or trade the token, its promotion triggered a market rally, catapulting GOAT‚Äôs valuation to over $400 million. The bot‚Äôs holdings of 1.93 million GOAT tokens skyrocketed in value, making it the first AI to achieve crypto millionaire status.</p>
<p>Truth Terminal‚Äôs success has made it very influential. turned it into a prominent figure in AI and cryptocurrency circles, amassing over 100,000 followers. Moving forward, Ayrey plans to release a roadmap. The bot‚Äôs influence continues to grow, sparking discussions on AI autonomy and its intersection with blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Truth Terminal is largely credited with spawning the AI Agent wave. A project called ai16z is credited with accelerating it.</p>
<p>In the wake of Truth Terminal, ai16z (no affiliation with a16z) launched Eliza. <strong>Eliza</strong> is a powerful multi-agent simulation framework designed to create, deploy, and manage autonomous AI agents. ‚ÄúBuilt with TypeScript, it provides a flexible and extensible platform for developing intelligent agents that can interact across multiple platforms while maintaining consistent personalities and knowledge.‚Äù (source: <a href="https://ai16z.github.io/eliza/docs/intro/#:~:text=Eliza%20is%20a%20powerful%20multi,maintaining%20consistent%20personalities%20and%20knowledge.">eliza docs</a>)</p>
<p>Eliza makes it really easy to launch an AI agent and customize its personality, identity, knowledge, and interaction style. These agents can be hooked up to social media sites, which has made interacting with them very easy. And some agents are amassing 100k+ followers, creating a lot of influence in the ecosystem. This has created 1000s of new AI agents and coins launched by them in the last several weeks.</p>
<p>AI agent swarms are groups of specialized agents working together to achieve shared goals. Each agent focuses on a specific task, while the group collectively handles complex challenges through collaboration.</p>
<p>AI agent swarms can be orchestrated to transform problem-solving by enabling networks of specialized agents to collaborate, learn from each other, scale to handle harder problems, and optimize tasks dynamically. As these multi-agent systems begin to prove their utility in many areas of technology, they open the possibility space to creating entirely new types of experiences and characters.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôve gotten this far into the post, congratulations. You are invited to be a part of our Regen AI Agent Swarm!</p>
<p>I think it would be really cool to have a swarm of regen ai agents trained on regen authors books and writings ‚Ä¶ mining the latent design space of regenerative CryptoEconomics, helping us cartography the space, and launching lots of cool web3 public goods stuff. If we believe</p>
<p>How? We each launch bots and our bots are talking to each other 24/7 about whatever we want. We tune it until they‚Äôre getting super cool, weird, or smart. We don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôll uncover but we‚Äôll find out along the way‚Ä¶</p>
