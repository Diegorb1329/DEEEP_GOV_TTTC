https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-fdd-workstream-season-13-budget-request/9826
    # FDD Workstream Season 13 Budget Proposal 

Workstream Mandate: Defend Gitcoin (Grants, DAO, & future products) from threats to its legitimacy, credible neutrality, and sustainability.

FDD is requesting $879,000 (93,500 GTC*) to fund Season 13 (S13) and replenish its reserves for S14.

## High Level Budget Breakdown

Season 13 Budget Total = $596,295 = 63.5k GTC ($9.40/GTC*)

PLUS Season 14 Reserves = $596,295

Total Needed = $1,192,590

MNUS Current Reserves = $313,000

Total Amount requested at this time = $879,590 =93,500 GTC ($9.40/GTC*)

**Prices last updated 2/9/22*

***The GTC total will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Snapshot and to Tally. The vote will be to send $879,590 in GTC at the current price when moved to Tally or the 20 day moving average (whichever is lower).***

[FDD Season 13 (Q1) 2022 Budget ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14vrj34-A-LwIPBGLTeWbOVdVuG8Jl2o1UZYeKp-zrl0/edit?usp=sharing)

# TL;DR

Season 12 Financials

* FDD made approximately $70k via good treasury management in S12
* $40k over budget was intentional as we spent ½ of what we gained in treasury management efficiency. Total Season 12 (Q4) spend was $440,000.
* Bi-weekly payments were made to contributors in a [transparent manner](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-AYF28k2tyv0-eDhfqcLdqymCRcp6CdTsDgkflsAqMU/edit?usp=sharing).

Season 12 Accomplishments

* [Sybil attack rate](https://hackmd.io/@bsci-gitcoin/HJdaK6yoY) jumped from around 6% of total contributions in GR11 to 26% in GR12 and FDD flagged 114,000 of them
* The anti-sybil ml pipeline had a [140% flagging efficiency rate](https://medium.com/block-science/gitcoin-grants-round-12-evaluation-results-bf01fe4c9641) meaning we detected 140% of what human evaluators alone would have detected.
* Increased human evaluations completed to over 6,000 - a 320% increase!
* Built [GIA software](https://gia-testing.ethelo.net/page/welcome-to-the-gia), tested on disputes, ran data analysis, and will be using it for all grant reviews in GR13. (This is better than comments on a notion page ie. previous system)
* GIA test had 53 participants - A huge decentralization compared to 5-10 hired evaluators
* Specifications made for a decentralized appeals system using Celeste or Kleros

Season 13 Financials

* Season 13 is $155k increase = 34% budget increase

Season 13 Round Deliverables

* We currently have 18 outcomes for the next 90 days. Each outcome has 3 measurable key results that will determine if we achieved the outcome.
* Ground Control (Operations)
  * > 90% of decisions for mid-season budget changes and new proposals will go through our FDD Operating System rather than just Disruption Joe
  * Disruption Joe will participate in our “[source council](https://gitcoin.notion.site/FDD-Source-Council-Pay-Model-cb5e03cc0f2a4752b698370b7622dcfa)” rather than having a workstream lead salary
  * Long term metric goals will be set to define the health of our initiatives
* Sybil Defenders
  * GitcoinDAO will run the end to end operational processes of the anti-sybil ml pipeline reducing our dependence on Blockscience
  * A simulation software will be developed to let us better anticipate attacks and possibly increase training opportunities for the ml models
  * A human evaluations app built for effective training, improved inter-reviewer reliability at a lower cost per evaluation, and continuous data insights
  * Work will continue on our long term vision [A Community Based Roadmap for Sybil Detection Across Web 3](https://gitcoin.co/blog/a-community-based-roadmap-for-sybil-detection-across-web-3/)
  * We will gain soft commitments and technical requirements from 3 partners to a sybil data sharing network built with a web 3 ethos & ethics
* Grants Investigation Agency (GIA)
  * We are using the GIA tool built last round to review the estimated 7-800 new grant applications that come in.
  * Our goals include increasing the number of reviewers per grant, lower the cost per review, and define a mechanism design that will allow us to open up the review process to anyone via staking of GTC
  * Building the decentralized appeals integration and testing it
  * Reviewing and updating ALL of the grant eligibility policy documentation

This budget was reviewed by many stakeholders including the FDD Multisig Oversight Council, other workstream leads, and some Gitcoin Holdings team members. One question that came up multiple times was “If you had to slash $x from your budget, do you know what you would cut?” The answer is yes. However, it wouldn’t be to the benefit of Gitcoin. We could operationally function at half this budget for GR13, but we wouldn’t be doing anything to build scalability into our tech or our processes.

Seeing the total donations increase round over round (S11 = $1.61m / 16.6 users to S12 = $3.2m / 27.2k users) at 50 - 100%, an increase of 34% to our budget seems justified. Especially considering the rate at which the sybil attacks are increasing (300-400%) and the complexity added to the grant eligibility process via side rounds.

# Season 13 Top Level OKRs

## Sybil Defenders - Legitimacy

### Gitcoin OKR: Decentralization

**FDD Objective: Build a community driven anti-sybil pipeline**

KR 1: # of contributors to the open-source feature engineering pipeline during season x

KR 2: (Cost / Human Evaluation) goes down while maintaining inter-reviewer reliability

KR 3: # of ecosystem data partners

## Grants Investigation Agency - Credible Neutrality

### Gitcoin OKR: Scalability

**FDD Objective: Increase participation, transparency, and legitimacy in Grant Eligibility process**

KR 1: Average reviewers per grant

KR 2: Total number of reviewers during season x

KR 3: Grant time to activation during review period

## Ground Control - Sustainability

### Gitcoin OKR: Decentralization

**FDD Objective: Be able to measure FDD health & increase the score**

KR 1: Contributor satisfaction metric go up

KR 2: GIA execution score go up

KR 3: Sybil Defense execution score go up

<br>

Each of these top level OKRs has a mandate steward driving FDD to achieve them along with 2 of our multisig oversight group who are assigned as their designated Subject Matter Expert Zone (SME Zone). The top level OKRs provide semi-constant metrics we can use to see FDD progress over the course of 12-18 months.

We ran almost 15 hours of strategy workshops to determine which outcomes we needed to achieve during Season 13 to achieve consistent results on our top level OKRs. (Some of which still need to be baselined during S13)

Outcome owners then selected their Key Results to indicate success over the next 90 days for each chosen outcome. This process was part of our new FDD Operating System (FDD OS) which will allow us to create hierarchies of work while removing hierarchies of people.

# Financials

[Season 12 Budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-AYF28k2tyv0-eDhfqcLdqymCRcp6CdTsDgkflsAqMU/edit?usp=sharing)

## Season 12 Funds Spent to Date

$416,613 as of 2/1/22. There is one more weekly epoch left to pay contributors meaning our total spend for the defense portion of the Q4 budget proposal will be $40-45k over budget. This is a conscious decision made by the workstream to use part of the earnings from strong treasury management to start new initiatives, improve a few ongoing ones, and fund the transition to the FDD-OS v1.0 governance model.

## Funds Carried Over From Season 12

$313k will be carried over from Season 12. This includes $278k in reserves plus $35k in treasury management gains.

## Budget Increase From Season 12 to Season 13

FDD will have spent $440k on defense in Season 12. The Season 13 ask is for $595k which is a $150k (34%) increase.

[Season 13 Budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14vrj34-A-LwIPBGLTeWbOVdVuG8Jl2o1UZYeKp-zrl0/edit?usp=sharing)

## Current Contributors

FDD had 8 full time contributors going into Season 12. After spinning out other workstreams, we now have 6. With our effort to pay a base to all source council members for FDD, we will be at 9 FT for Season 13.

Format Below: Name (Outcomes owned)

### Workstream Lead

Disruption Joe (Payments / FDD OS / ASOP Transfer / SDW Discovery)

### Mandate Stewards

Ground Control (Ops): SirLupinWatson (Contributor Experience / Human Evaluations)
Sybil Defense: Omnianalytics: (Data Analysis / Community Model / Trust Bonus Update)
Grants Investigation Agency: David Dyor (Policy / Appeals)

### Source Council

Includes all above plus all squad drivers (outcome owners)

Nollied (Data Storage Layer/Matrix/GIA Development)
Kishorditya (Mandate Delivery)
Waka (Contributor CAP Table Modeling)
Zer8 (GIA Reviews)
BFA (GIA Rewards)

The average Source Council member will make $90,000 USD annually as a combination of:

* $500 Base (Flat amount paid weekly)
* $500 Coordinape ($500/ SC member distributed via Coordinape)
* $100 Participation (Show up for Weekly Update / Report Payments on Time)
* $250 For each outcome owned
* $250 Mandate Steward Bonus
* $500 Workstream Lead Bonus
* 10% SC Bonus paid quarterly based on OKR completion

In our modeling, the top 3 earners would make an annual income of $150k, $120k, and $109k as workstream lead and mandate stewards with 2 or 3 outcomes owned. The bottom three who only own one outcome each would earn $49k, $57k, and $58k.

This is highly aligned with their levels of participation and skills needed for their various positions within the workstream.

### Contributors

FDD had 61 total contributors in Season 12. 20 are currently “trial” contributors. The first season a contributor participates is their trial season. During their trial season, they are not able to make proposals to the source council.

FDD will not be hiring on a “full time” or “part time” basis during season 13. Our source council could all be considered full time. Regular contributors range from 1-4 hours per quarter up to 30+ hours per week.

## Multisig Address & Keyholders

Gnosis Safe address: 0xD4567069C5a1c1fc8261d8Ff5C0B1d98f069Cf47

Workstream MultiSig is a Gnosis Safe 4/7 setup with the following keyholders who act as board members or oversight to the actions of this stream. Each multisig keyholder has a responsibility to work with a mandate steward leading our top level goals in their “Subject Matter Expert Zone”. (Many are skilled in multiple zones but are only assigned to one to ensure their ability to keep up with the dynamic changes and help guide our work.)

* **Disruption Joe** (Workstream Lead)
  * Operations / Collaborative Design / Mechanism Design / Growth
  * Former Gitcoin Holdings Grants Ops - First to leave company for DAO
* **Michael Zargham** (Ops)
  * ML / Fraud Detection / Ethics / Systems Design
  * Gitcoin Steward / Blockscience CEO / cadCAD
* **Angela Kreitenweis/Conectopia** (Ops) -
  * Mechanism Design / DAO Comp / Research / Policy
  * Gitcoin Steward / Token Engineering Academy
* **Trueblocks** (Sybil)
  * Data Analytics / On-chain data / Commons Management
  * Gitcoin Steward / Trueblocks LLC
* **Armand Brunelle** (Sybil)
  * ML / Software Development / Contributor Experience
  * Gitcoin Steward / FDD Contributor, Mandate Steward, Source Council
* **Bob Jiang** (Grants)
  * Scrum/Agile / Chinese Ecosystem / Customer Support
  * Gitcoin Steward / Former FDD / Gitcoin User Support Lead / ENS Steward
* **Annika Lewis** (Grants)
  * Venture Capital / Operations / Strategy
  * PGF Workstream Leadership / Grants Program Lead

All multisig keyholders are represented by their LLC and are not personally connected or liable for actions of the FDD or GitcoinDAO.

All keyholders are confirmed as committed to the responsibilities outlined in the [FDD-WG Multisig Keyholder Responsibilities 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18k7I7hkhyldFqzrRZLc9uBshDWpwFtVyV9Bkk8V0jjk/edit?usp=sharing) document.

This budget request as per established norms for FDD budget requests is set to double our estimated quarterly budget for defensive measures to ensure that this workstream can properly function without issue in the instance of delayed votes, market downturns, & political issues.

# In Conclusion: From Disruption Joe

FDD has been in the process of progressively decentralizing itself while learning to balance efficiency and decentralization. Our new FDD Operating System allows us to continue removing authority given (top-down) to authority recognized (bottom-up). Our model is built to follow core principles of subsidiarity and parpolity.

FDD is a single customer entity with the mandate of defending Gitcoin from threats to its legitimacy, credible neutrality, and sustainability. We are working hard to not only defend Gitcoin, but to do so in a way that what we build is modular, composable, and extendable to the rest of the DAO and web 3. The structure we are built on should be sustainable as long as its output is positive-sum.

As the FDD workstream lead, I intend to continue this role as a participant after releasing my workstream lead rights to our source council and the processes of the FDD OS over the next 2-3 quarters. I intend to leave FDD with a structure that will efficiently produce its intended outcomes and adapt to changing circumstances. Most importantly it will dissipate when it is no longer needed just as my leadership role will dissipate when our structure is sustainable.

Web 2 and all of human history was built on a finite amount of resources which could represent value. This perverted the incentives causing people to create collective entities (corporations / governments / institutions) which exist for a purpose when they are created, but would turn parasitic when that purpose was no longer needed. They would continue to exist for the sake of existing with embedded growth obligations causing the good-natured individuals to turn a blind eye to the dystopia their collective decisions would cause.

We now have infinite scarcity to represent the values we truly care about. It is now more profitable to cooperate than to compete. Therefore, the incentives guiding Gitcoin to a solarpunk future include us investing in our values and moving our investments as our needs change.

When an entity no longer has a purpose, it no longer needs to exist because the composable structure DAOs are building IS the future of work. Individuals no longer need to turn a blind eye to the parasitic or cancerous nature of their employer. They will simply exit. This will happen either gracefully or tragically, but it will happen.

I hope that my role in FDD will be an example of the former. I hope to model this transition in the near future and continue to serve the greater purpose of Gitcoin - **To build and fund the public good**

[Proposal] FDD Workstream Season 13 Budget Request
griff

            <p>No votes shouldn’t count towards quorum… that seems like a flaw in the system honestly.</p>
<p>Maybe I should start a moratorium… h/t to Vlad, Gun, and Dino</p>
<p>RE: Reserves</p>
<p>Just to throw my hat in the ring here… I would advocate for ALL work streams to have budget for continuing their work if Governance is slow… If we don’t do that, there are 2 options:</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#1</span> (most likely) Individuals step up and take on risk to continue the work, either by paying people out of their own pocket or by working with the risk of not being paid.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#2</span> Critical infrastructure fails.</p>
<p>This is not good business. We need a solution that doesn’t allow for either of those options.</p>
<p>Until another solution emerges, having a reserve for each work stream is just smart and real, Governance in DAOs is slow and unpredictable, and a prudent work stream lead should prepare for funding issues if they are stewarding critical infrastructure. A Reserve creates a buffer for the Work stream to continue or transition as needed without having to pause payments. People have bills to pay and we need to create a safety net so they can continue to work and pay those bills even if the unexpected happens.</p>

<p>I would love to align on a reasonable reserve for all workstreams as part of S13 execution, and the concession has me really conflicted. A no vote feels harsh given the timelines it takes for budgets to be approved, and that is something I want to lean into as well during S13. (ie, should it take 15 days to get budgets approved, and if so, how do we make sure the budgets are approved with enough time to confirm operations and sort out differences). <strong>I will likely abstain from the vote, and not vote no as I also want to act in good faith with the concessions being offered here.</strong></p>
<p>I agree it is a bit unfair for the entire workstream to be without funding while process runs and I would not want to create a culture of anxiety around the budgeting process. I also dont think we should tie the outcomes of a large workstream all together (ie, is Ground Control is not performing, and Sybil is… Should all funding be withheld?). I look forward to discussing more and I am optimistic we may see some bigger changes ahead of S14.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You are right. It is unfair and I didn’t mean to offend you or Kris. <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/akrtws">@akrtws</a> was able to articulate the dynamics of the workstream pace of innovation and the DAO as a whole being mismatched and not providing the stewards with the tools needed to execute their responsibilities.</p>
<p>(There is also the example of <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/zargham">@Zargham</a> who accepted responsibility as an FDD multisig keyholder and chose not to be a GitcoinDAO steward accepting delegations because the time commitment to FDD was as much as he could responsibly handle. I am not saying that to criticize as we are all learning together, but instead trying to highlight other modes of operation that might help us better achieve our mission.)</p>
<p>This workstream reporting was something FDD identified in Q3 last year as a threat to Gitcoin and started to look into, but then was told it was “out of our scope” and pushed to spin out the initiatives that are supposed to be handling this. In talking with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/griff">@griff</a> this week, it seems like smaller workstreams might help.</p>
<p>Perhaps in S14, FDD could dissolve and leave sybil defense and grants eligibility as individual workstreams, but for this season I think it is best to move forward as is. We have a lot of work to do with 3 weeks until the next grants round starts. To update structure now would be very tough.</p>

<p>There are 9 on the source council receiving full time pay.<br>
I’d recommend looking at a startup “Sr. Business Manager” or “Operations Director” for my role. (I will be paid as part of the source council and even got docked $100 this week for not reporting my payments on time… <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/man_facepalming.png?v=12" title=":man_facepalming:" class="emoji" alt=":man_facepalming:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">)</p>
<p>For the other higher paid on the source council you might look at “Systems Architect” “Sr. Software Developer” “Data Operations Director” “Machine Learning Engineer”. For these, I would argue we are paying lower than US market value even though a DAO should pay more imho. We are able to do this because of the passion, preferred working style, and other benefits of being a part of this community which our contributors enjoy.</p>
<p>For the lower side, &lt; $70k is under the line where people are able to start saving in the US. You can see on the chart in the presentation slide deck that three of 9 would be under this level. This is ok because the people who only hold one outcome and are at this level are newer to FDD or having their first try at owning an outcome.</p>

</aside>
<p>I assure you that FDD has no intention of spinning out of Gitcoin. We don’t want another customer at that level because the collective decision making structure that is FDD has a mandate specific to Gitcoin. If that need were to no longer exist, it would dissolve rather than find a customer.</p>
<p>I do see the potential for subDAOs of Sybil, FDD, and GitcoinDAO being great revenue opportunities. In fact, I pitched a Sybil Detection DAO at Metapod 2 days ago and got 2nd place, followed by at least 10 dms asking how to use the services. (One of the outcomes we are working on is building the community data warehouse for our sybil defense work. What if we used the same architecture for a data collective that preserved privacy and was governed by the community?)</p>

<p>Because we have the reserves from our last budget (Plus another $30k from treasury management gains) we are able to push this decision for a month or two if needed.)</p>
<p>Overall Lefteris, I think solving sybil defense and the community consent of which grants are eligible on the platform are two of the biggest problems Gitcoin needs to solve. As much as we need marketing, PR, and operations for today, we need to solve those for tomorrow.</p>
<p>Here is what Kyle listed for streams with my adjustment for FDD to compare Season budget amounts rather than total requests (reserves issue separate)<br>
MMM - 30K GTC (likely another 20K funded by Holdings right now)<br>
PGF - 100K GTC (likely another 30K is funded by Holdings right now)<br>
FDD - 63K GTC (No funding by Holdings right now)<br>
DAO Ops - 40K GTC (likely another 30K is funded by Holdings right now)<br>
dGrants - 0 GTC (On Hold)<br>
dCompass - 38K GTC (No funding by Holdings right now)<br>
MSC - 130K GTC (likely another 20K is funded by Holdings right now)</p>
<p>Please consider the total amounts Gitcoin spends on each workstream including the subsidies from Holdings before making your decision.</p>

<p>Yes to that - adds to the need to further develop Gitcoin DAO roles.</p>
<p>Many of the issues mentioned in this whole discussion (role definitions, reserves, timelines, reviewing process) are caused by the fact that the organisational set up obviously didn’t keep pace with the workstreams’ development.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have over 700k GTC delegated to you. I think it is your duty to understand it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>As a steward with lots of GTC delegated to me too who is actually trying to put as much of my free time as possible reading through proposals and voting and keeping up to date with what’s happening I find this really unfair.</p>
<p>I have spent quite a few hours per week on this DAO since its inception, and wasted lots of gas in proposals and votes and multisig actions. All of this without receiving a wei in compensation for my time. Not even gas rebates.</p>
<p>Having GTC delegated to me does not pay me in any way for my time which is quite very limited. So no I don’t think it’s my, or any other steward’s duty to do <strong>anything</strong> unless we start getting paid and also have a contractual relation with the DAO.</p>
<p>I realize this is quite different to the view I had when I first started being a steward but I had seriously underestimated the amount of pro bono work this would require when the DAO was starting.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Amount of funds</strong></p>
<p>Now for the proposal itself. I also find it really hard to be asked to judge how much money other people should get from the DAO, how much their work is worth when all of this judgement on my and fellow delegates side is supposed to be pro bono.</p>
<p>For the amount of funds the salaries look high to me as a European but I understand probably are okay for American standards.</p>
<p><strong>Reserves</strong></p>
<p>For the reserves I also find it really weird a given workstream of the DAO would need any sort of reserves. So long as the DAO has funds, the workstreams would be funded by the DAO as long as they do their work.</p>
<p>Having reserves sounds like FDD wants to spin into its own organization completely which I find alarming. I think this may outline a politics and communication problem inside the Gitcoin DAO.</p>
<p>I would much rather prefer to see Gitcoin DAO as a whole figure out a way to make sure all its employees have no disruptions in their payments through a common and unified approach rather than have a single workstream have such big reserves.</p>
<p><strong>FDD Peformance Review</strong></p>
<p>I am always on and reading in the discord ocassionally and have read all the material provided here. It is my impression that FDD is doing a good job and is helping Gitcoin grants a lot. The ideas  pushed by <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle">@kyle</a> about having another customer too sound also interesting.</p>
<p>What I would also like to see though is a performance review of the FDD made by another workstream or DAO member. Since all the material I have read are actually made by FDD they could be biased. So would be nice to see an independent performance review.</p>
<p>This is more of a comment on all workstreams though, not just FDD. It would be nice to have some kind of formal review process to which all workstreams would fall under. And the result of this review would be created by a person/group external to the reviewed workstream and would be perhaps easier to read by the stewards who would know.</p>
<p>I am under the impression that FDD is doing a good job.</p>
<hr>
<p>In closing I have not yet made up my mind completely on how I will vote as there is some things I have doubts for as mentioned above.</p>

[Proposal] FDD Workstream Season 13 Budget Request
DisruptionJoe

            <p>The FDD proposal is now on <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0x93d337378cc8c6c507b88ebb518ddd57f772bb010b75cb9daaae03974eeacfdb" class="inline-onebox">Snapshot</a> here.</p>
<p>Before stewards vote, I’d like to offer a point of reconciliation in a hope to sway those pushing for a no vote. I’d like to offer a compromise to address the core reasons expressed for voting no after a nice heart to heart in Denver yesterday with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/krrisis">@krrisis</a> and a few shorter discussions with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle">@kyle</a> the past week.</p>
<p><strong>ASK - I’d like you to be ok with our 90 days of reserves on this budget and vote YES as is</strong></p>
<p>There isn’t a fundamental issue with the Season 13 budget at this point, but with the reserves.</p>
<p>The arguments against have not been about whether FDD is getting results and executing. They come from a place of concern with our rate of growth and the DAOs overall ability to assess the effectiveness of a workstream’s efforts. Combine this with the concern that the DAO as a whole hasn’t figured out how to prioritize budget between all of the workstreams.</p>
<p>I agree with these observations. I will address one at a time, then follow with my argument for the reserves.</p>
<p><strong>Compromise 1 - We address the core issue of budget growth and rate of budget growth by agreeing that “structured streams” have a capped rate of budget growth (w/ specific CSDO override mechanism if needed)</strong></p>
<p>During Season 13 we will work together to formulate a percentage cap to the allowable growth rate cap for structured streams. We will also formally set the requirements for being a “structured” or “semi-structured” stream and the benefits a workstream may receive for participating in CSDO governance.</p>
<p><strong>Compromise 2 - We will collaborate to improve the DAOs overall ability to assess the effectiveness of a workstream’s efforts</strong></p>
<p>The FDD Mandate Delivery squad is tasked with determining the effectiveness and health of FDD initiatives. While I believe each workstream should be able to track this on their own, it would be great to take the learnings from our effort which is needed sooner because of our mission critical functions, then collaborate to design a framework to be owned by DAOops in the future.</p>
<p>This could include spinning out this squad to DAOops for Season 14 or simply reducing these efforts from around 4% of FDD total budget to &lt; 1%.</p>
<p><strong>Compromise 3 -  We collaborate to figure out a framework to prioritize budget between all of the workstreams</strong></p>
<p>One steward, <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/tjayrush">@tjayrush</a> has suggested we put a % of total budget on all the budget requests. We did this within FDD as you can see on our <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1J8CZrd0hb60sSc3uDj1891urMwZwlrSGspA3xyrTOIA/edit?usp=sharing">FDD Season 13 Budget Proposal Details</a>, but couldn’t do it with the entire DAO.</p>
<p>We can collaborate on a framework for providing this context to the entire DAO in the future.</p>
<p>As for this budget proposal, FDD is only asking for 60-70k GTC for season 13 (depending on GTC price).  This is not the largest seasonal budget request, or the second largest. However, solving sybil resistance (ensuring each vote is a unique human) and grant eligibility (community curation of consent to participate) are the two of the most important problems for Gitcoin to solve.</p>
<p>Because of the importance of these efforts, it seems that our relative prioritization is reasonable for this season before we agree to the new framework.</p>
<p><strong>My argument on why reserves are reasonable</strong></p>
<p>I believe not having reserves is both operationally a potential problem, but also detrimental to contributors mental health and financial stability. I think we are all in agreement that the workstreams could still be held accountable even if they have more than 90 days of operating budget at a time.</p>
<p>My argument is that ALL workstreams should have at least 90 days of runway at a any given time. We shouldn’t back them into a corner.</p>
<p>With the current system, contributors can only plan expectations of an income for 90 days at the beginning of a season. At the end, they might only be able to plan a few weeks or days into the future. (Right now for example, most workstreams would be in the red if they actually executed and uses the budget they requested for Season 12.)</p>
<p>With my suggestion, even in the last days of the season, a structured workstream would benefit from having 90 days of financial stability at the end of each quarter rather than at the beginning.</p>
<p>Yes, it is an assumption that they will execute. I think this is reasonable as we can set the requirements for being a structured workstream to include a level of earning this trust. (Maybe after a first trial season, they get this right?)</p>
<p>I’d encourage us to assess whether this would be appropriate for all workstreams during the upcoming season and before s14 proposals as part of this compromise.</p>
<p>Thank you both for your attention, professionalism, and honest feedback.</p>

[Proposal] FDD Workstream Season 13 Budget Request
tjayrush

            <p>I’ve decided to vote yes on this proposal even though I have reservations. In particular, the increase in the budget given that the budget is being driven from the ground up is concerning.</p>
<p>I realize this is probably the only way for the budget to be driven, given the early nature of the process, but a bottom-up budget that increases at this rate, I am sure everyone would agree, is unsustainable.</p>
<p>In the future, I will probably vote against a budget increase of this size (for any of the streams) without a much clearer “from-the-top” feeling for how it fits into the larger DAO’s mission / planning.</p>
<p>EDITED: I should have said how amazed I am with Joe’s energy, his positive attitude, his attention to details, and the huge amount of work he’s already put in. Nothing I say above is reflective of my thoughts on Decentrazation Joe or any of the team.</p>

<p>This sentence implies the FDD gets supported for a couple reasons that are not related to mission-first activity of fraud detection &amp; defence.  This statement is unsettling on several levels.  Mostly it hints we are losing focus of the mission.  Funding public goods &amp; oss.  Is this really suggesting the workstream dedicated to protecting the funding is only supported because 1)fdd members want to get paid and 2) Stewards like Joe’s writing ?  Well I like to think people support the fdd because they don’t want funds going to bad actors.  The fact Joe is a good writer only helps communicate the granular details to voters.  This feels like somebody accusing an political party of gaining support only because they have a nice brochure.  The brochure is just a proxy for the platform and ideology.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FDD is the only workstream who has been ‘saving up’</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The talk around the FDD GR13 budget is illuminating.  I see issues similar to the issues at hand when considering numerous grant applications from 1 large Dao.  It is all about financial connection and accountability.  Are the sub-daos routing money back to the parent dao?  Are Gitcoin Dao workstreams routing funds to the greater Dao somehow?  How is profit shared from each parent &amp; sub dao?  Now these issues are confronting GC as we debate budgets.  I would like to know how much and by what manner Gitcoin GPG/LLC exerts control over those workstreams it funds.  I was fairly surprised to learn that not all workstreams get equal support from the core.</p>
<p>Kris said the support shown by FDD members somehow means there is a lack of non-workstream member support.  This is a reach imo.  Something about correlation not equal to causation comes to mind.  For Kris this translates into a reason he likely won’t support the budget.  Did I land in bizzaro world somehow?  Aren’t dedicated workstream participants a reason to increase budgets not decrease them?  Personally want I the most leaned-in contributors to get the most budget and power.</p>
<p>Some workstreams get direct funding from the GPG?  say what?!?  I had no idea.</p>
<p>Some workstreams actively manage their treasury to create revenue.  Nicely done! (but here comes the tax collector.  The benefits of great treasury management should be awarded mainly to the workstream that created it imo. I could see allocating 20% back to the parent dao maybe.)</p>
<p>Some workstreams are thinking of spinning off into an independent dao.  whoa.  Feels like this is quite a divisive idea.  Are we Gitcoin a nebulous group of linked mini-daos with narrow scopes?  Or are we Gitcoin Dao - Funder of OSS and its Developers?  I sure hope for the latter, but Ostrom seems to favor the former.  Please educate me on why this is better.<br>
Responsibility for innovation at Gitcoin is uncertain.  Nobody seems to know who should push the innovation envelope beyond MSC.  I think innovation is one of those org-wide topics that deserves org-wide guidance.  In the absence of wide-spread guidance this responsibility falls on each workstream.  I argue it is the workstream folks who are best suited to guide innovation within their stream’s mandate.  FDD should guide FDD innovation.  PGF should guide their own innovation.  And so on.  Would be great to get some input from the greater Steward group and GPG but until  then we got you covered.  The FDD has some innovation ideas evolved from many rounds of successful mission completion.  Please don’t cancel these goals.  It is too sudden and drastic imo.  If there is some dissent, let’s discuss and shift some of these goals as the group deems proper.  The suggestion to cut-off the innovation arm of the FDD comes without warning, without time to prepare for the transition and without thought of the FDD staff that are involved in these areas.  If anything, cut the weakest innovation ideas, not the program itself.  I’d love to see a Gitcoin survey about which areas of innovation are most favoured by the community.  There are likely innovative experiments happening in workstreams that we don’t even know about yet.</p>
<p>Above all, I want to heartily thank Kyle, Kris and Joe for their time detail and commitment to Gitcoin.  You folks demonstrate the ‘leaned-in’ behavior I try to mimic.  The energy you three are giving the program is so admirable.  Yes it is push-back, but that is what will make us lean and agile.  Thank you &lt;3.  Also thank you to all the other commenters and folks dedicated to prudent money management at Gitcoin.  We need you all.</p>

<p>I think you are underestimating our Stewards. Some might have skimmed it, but take <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/akrtws">@akrtws</a> for example. She is part of our multisig as a steward providing oversight of our workstream and is not a paid contributor of FDD. (FDD set ourselves up with a 4/7 multisig designed to represent our stakeholders and provide an additional layer of oversight which the other streams haven’t done.)</p>
<p>She participated in a 2 hour overview session giving very tough criticisms and then had multiple one on one discussions with myself and other contributors. After responding to her and other multisig keyholder critiques, we eventually got to this final request.</p>
<p>To say that she, or <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/bobjiang">@bobjiang</a> and other stewards are not fulfilling their duty if they support this budget request is not necessarily the case.</p>

</aside>
<p>FDD is not spinning itself out as a standalone DAO. We have no interest of doing that. We may incubate projects that end up having a broader application potential than our mandate in which case we would support them spinning out. A community data collective for sybil detection for example.</p>
<p>I am 100% focused on serving FDD’s mandate which is defending Gitcoin against threats to its legitimacy, credible neutrality, and sustainability.</p>
<p>I fundamentally disagree that reserves for one season, another 90 days, makes it so FDD isn’t accountable for its results. Additionally, I will be bringing a proposal to CSDO before next season to establish a norm around reserves for all workstreams.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, I’m a little shocked that you, as the person responsible for contributor experience, feel as though the way to achieve accountability is by putting contributors financial stability and mental safety at a higher risk than necessary. 90 days of extra funding is not going to strip workstreams of accountability imho.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree that DAOops should own this for GitcoinDAO as a whole, but each stream does need to manage its own internal governance. We are explicitly working to do this well. This is less than 4% of our total budget. Whether or not a workstream explicitly identifies these needs in their budget does not mean it isn’t executing and paying for them.</p>
<p>Secondly, our governance process says that after 5 days on the governance forum and 5 steward comments, the proposal should move to snapshot. Even after getting the required amount of comments, our proposal is still not on snapshot 5 days later. (I could post, but I’m trying to go along with some hard work by <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/pop">@Pop</a> to improve steward comms.)</p>
<p>The reason for this delay was cited as stewards requesting more time to review the proposals. No steward posted these requests on the governance forum or in the Stewards channel in Discord.  Now, I am NOT accusing anyone of wrongdoing, but you could see how with you being the only steward who has commented during this delay period, one could be see this as delaying the vote so you could post this critique.</p>
<p><strong>For this reason I think you should ABSTAIN from voting on this proposal.</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, it shows the need for multiple workstreams to be actively involved in governance.</p>

<p>How do you reconcile these two sentences? In one you state that we should not focus on becoming the most effective DAO, then you say that FDD should focus on streamlining our focus for simplicity and effectiveness.</p>

[Proposal] FDD Workstream Season 13 Budget Request
      

[Proposal] FDD Workstream Season 13 Budget Request
krrisis

            <p>Thank you for this massively detailed proposal Joe.</p>
<p>I think I’ve now (re)read all of the comments, plus also the comments under <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle">@kyle</a>’s <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/summary-s13-budget-proposal-recap-kyles-voter-guide/9856">voter guide</a>.</p>
<p>As always extremely impressed and inspired by the level of detail put in your proposals, I think the thoroughness of your approach &amp; transparency can and should be an inspiration for any DAO.</p>
<p>I’ve spent quite a few days on mulling over whether I should abstain from voting or vote no - the way it currently stands <strong>I will probably vote no on the current budget.</strong> The main reasons for this are 1) the <strong>reserves</strong> which are requested and 2) the <strong>investments in innovation and governance</strong> within this workstream, which increase complexity and imo reduces effectiveness, at least at this point in our DAO’s timeline.</p>
<p>When I read the comments here - except for Kyle’s, who went for a hardcore deep dive - I think it shows that many people are supportive for one of two reasons: either they are a part of FDD and for this reason might be biased and/or see things I am missing, or they are stewards who appreciate the thoroughness of the FDD proposal and for this reason are supportive of the proposal, without actually understanding in detail what you are proposing and why.<br>
It shows we still have a long way to go to incentivize Stewards to dive in and allocate enough time for these crucial decisions, and hopefully <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/pop">@Pop</a>’s <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-steward-council-formation-mandate/9843/2">council proposal (WIP)</a> will help on that level.<br>
Both of these observations are very subjective and I am sure might rub some people the wrong way. I for my part can honestly say that I do not understand all of it, and it is one of the many reasons I am/was hesitating to vote, I simply do not have the time available to dig even deeper.</p>
<p>However, because of the large amount being requested, reading kyle’s observations combined with my own observations of the workings of FDD as a daily and <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-dao-operations-workstream-budget-q1-2022/9488">full-time contributor</a> within the DAO, and especially point 1) &amp; 2) above I will probably vote no on this iteration of the budget.</p>
<p>Some more detail on my logic here:</p>
<p><strong>1) Reserves</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>we don’t want to be unable to perform due to political hiccups</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>FDD is the only workstream who has been ‘saving up’ and I think the argumentation shows we mainly need to work on getting rid of internal politics (which indeed do exist! and are very frustrating) and get better at DAOing. However, allowing these (enormous) reserves is counterproductive: it is basically saying that our governance mechanisms of allocating budgets are not working / cannot be trusted. To be honest I agree with that point <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> The answer however imo is not to keep doing this &amp; have funds ready to allow spinning out as a standalone DAO or to cease collaboration, but to work more on / invest more in the operations of the DAO as a whole, and improve our communication &amp; governance mechanisms, as we have one shared/joint mission.</p>
<p><strong>2) Innovation / Governance</strong></p>
<p>Working within the DAO Operations Workstream I can say that there is a lot we need to do when it comes to effective governance, transparency and incentivization, there’s room for massive amounts of improvement &amp; growth, and FDD has been leading the way here, because no one else was. However, I do not think these initiatives should be developed under FDD, they belong <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-dao-operations-workstream-budget-q1-2022/9488">mostly under DAOops</a>, which now exists and is slowly scaling.<br>
This is not a question of centralization, it is even the opposite to me, as DAO Operations was created to service shared needs of the entire DAO. With certain elements of this proposal we are actually working towards a centralization of power within one workstream, and I think we are too early in the process of our own DAO (and all DAOs) to move this fast. Personally I think it could endanger the focus on the mission of Gitcoin, <a href="https://gitcoin.co/mission">which is to build and fund public goods</a>, not to become the most effective DAO.<br>
Ideally one day we’ll be both.</p>
<p>I think the work of FDD is mission-critical, so I would vote 100% yes on a budget that is considerably reduced. I trust the calculations by Kyle make sense, which brings us to <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/summary-s13-budget-proposal-recap-kyles-voter-guide/9856/3">a budget around 35K GTC on top of what is already available.</a></p>
<p>I think this leaves plenty of room for innovation (also on topics of governance, eg the source council) and might be a signal for FDD to focus even more on its core mission, streamline for simplicity and effectiveness, and a signal for DAOops that it needs to really and urgently invest in better governance and incentivization modelling for the entirety of GitcoinDAO.</p>
<p>What you want to achieve within the boundaries of the budget that will remain - which is still around 50K GTC (!) counting the built-up reserves is still very ambitious.</p>

<p>It’s like having a fire dept. Unless your town is super small, you need one. Additionally, all the advancements made by the big ones will be open source and free for the smaller town fire departments to build upon.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I do believe every major city indeed needs its own fire department, and we have one, but we are not a big city just yet, we are a big name, but counting active (and effective) contributors, we are still a ‘baby DAO’, and we have already spent a lot of time on reducing internal politics aligning, in challenging times and a long-distance context, simplicity is key in order to continue on that path.</p>
<p>The vision for FDD is fantastic and I hope building a ‘sybil defense network for the metaverse’ is where we will arrive at. But let’s first make sure our city is thriving, viable &amp; regenerative, before its fire department becomes a city on itself.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: I hope this feedback is useful and is interpreted the way it is intended: some constructive thoughts to help us achieve both our medium &amp; long term goals, without stifling innovation or demotivating you or other contributors. I believe in moonshots and I believe even more in the need for a decentralized world, but I’ve also first-hand seen the risks &amp; failures of bringing too many layers of complexity too soon.</p>
<p>I will not have the time to respond to comments on this in the way that Kyle has done above and under <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/summary-s13-budget-proposal-recap-kyles-voter-guide/9856">his summary</a> because of Ethdenver and a number of other reasons.

<p>We imagine a future in which the GIA will be self funded with a grant on Gitcoin and the reviewers will be incetivised that way and maybe create their own sub DAO hybrid, idk</p>
<p>I appreciate the time and thought you have give to our beloved FDD btw, these are very good conversations to have and they could lead to very constructive things.</p>
<p>During GR12 we accomplished a lot here at the FDD(haha, I’m part of the stream, how could I not be biased), we actually delivered and defended the DAO while maintaining credible neutrality. We experimented and decentralized all of the squads and even the core structure that we used in GR12 and evolved to this format for GR13. The OS that Joe presented is really an innovation and I think this is quite “unique” in GItcoin DAO.  We have also been the home of research related to descentralization, reward systems and governance systems.</p>

<p>i didn’t say it costs gas to create a grant… the “fraud tax” that you mentioned is in reference to gas costs for contributions &amp; the splitting of funds into separate wallets…in order for you to donate to any grant it costs gas, not only that but sybil accounts have to split their money to other wallets somehow. how else would they do this without paying gas?</p>

</aside>
<p>i’m not sure what you mean by “programmatic reviews”. but it’s basically just taking the criteria that human reviewers usually base their decisions off of, turn them into criteria with “pass” or “fail” buttons for each one, which makes it easier for humans to review faster, more consistently, and with lower barrier to entry.</p>
<p>it’s basically just a nicer google forms setup curated for the grant review process. alongside this, there is also all of the usual grant review processes that existed before, hence the larger budget, we just rebranded it all to “GIA”.</p>
<p>your space pen/pencil joke is still lacking a sense of reality with respect to GIA/FDD-policy. GR12 was great, and our human reviewers learned a lot, but their path was a little inefficient. a closer analogy would be that we found our way home from school, but walked an extra 2 miles due to some inefficient path choices. now, were leveraging our experience to take turns that get us home quicker.</p>
<p>this was used for our GR12 pilot:<br>

<p>————————<br>
my recommendation for you is to seek context before making very impactful budgetary decisions. this is partially FDD’s fault as a workstream, and it’s something that myself and others are trying to push towards communicating context better. maybe try to participate a little more, especially when it seems like things don’t make sense.</p>

[Proposal] FDD Workstream Season 13 Budget Request
maerg

            <p>Once again, there is a great discussion on another FDD proposal; which is consistent with FDDs values to provide an immense amount of transparency to their operations.</p>
<p><strong>I am supportive of this proposal.</strong><br>
FDD is leading the efforts of progressive decentralization within the Gitcoin DAO community.<br>
FDD provides a great amount of Workstream structure for the other Workstreams to follow.</p>
<p>I agree with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/disruptionjoe">@DisruptionJoe</a> here;</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>a proven track record of not abusing the reserves in the past</li>
<li>$70k in treasury management gains last season (more than the entire DAO combined)</li>
<li>High transparency - Perhaps the most transparency of any workstream (DAOops, which uses our system or maybe moonshot, but it is onchain rather than human readable)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>But also I think what <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle">@kyle</a> mentions here is incredibly important. I think there is a need to have a detailed conversation on Workstream treasury management moving forward. I think FDDs practices are proven healthy for the Gitcoin DAO in general, and there should be a learning, trial &amp; error process for all the workstreams to implement and improve what FDD puts on the table as an example.</p>

<p>I understand we differ here. No other WS is requesting this, and this tells me it is not a DAO-wide norm, but something unique to FDD. I am down to chat about this at CSDO and see if we want to adopt a new standard like this in the future.</p>

<p>this is another example where we are building and scaling without stopping to evaluate how to solve the problem from first principles. For example, have we considered requiring 25 DAI to be staked per new grant request to help increase the fraud tax on this process?

<p>staking in the process will have no more of an effect than an increased gas price. it’s an interesting idea, but ultimately a sybil attacker already has to front a large amount for gas. although, it would be worth simulating the affects of such a mechanism. i will keep this in mind as we progress with the matrix (red team) squad.</p>

</aside>
<p>exactly what is duplicative? the data storage layer is part of ground control, the function of which has been <em>pushed off for a very long time</em>.</p>
<p>also, DAO Ops has proven to be too coarse to actually have a tangible impact in FDD… bubble-up emergence of organization is more affective in both the short and long term (isn’t this what the DAO wants to facilitate…?) pragmatism (natural selection) rules, not downward imposed idealistic solutions.</p>

<p>GIA seems like the wrong solution to the problem, but I would leave that $75K budget intact with the hopes of us partnering with GPG to build in a staking model in GR14, or another software based hurdle (recognizing a change for GR13 is likely too aggressive).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>do you know what the GIA even is? it’s goal is to decentralize and cut costs in the long term. maybe we aren’t communicating it’s function properly (<a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/david_dyor">@David_Dyor</a> and i just discussed writing up an article to sum everything up), but simply dismissing it as the “wrong solution” seems naive…</p>

<p>Sybil Defenders budget seems pretty heavy, but I am not an expert in how to cut there.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>i do somewhat agree. i have been vocal about my discontent with the sybil problem and relying on DID/sybil as a crutch. we had <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-vision-for-a-pluralistic-civilizational-scale-infrastructure-for-funding-public-goods/9503/10">an enlightening exchange with glen weyl (QF paper author) about this</a>.</p>
<p>however i still think your reasoning isn’t very well thought out. the double-paying you are referring to is the growing pains of offboarding this responsibility onto the DAO. <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/omnianalytics">@omnianalytics</a> is running the initiative to offload our sybil ML process partially onto the community (open source) in collaboration with the data storage layer squad that I lead, which will alleviate a lot of funding in the future.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This assumes that in S14, we can reduce costs as the “double payment” for BSCI and Community run models goes away, the GIA work is hopefully greatly reduced (if GPG can help build staking into grant creation or some other software deterrent to the deluge of new spammy grants), and DAO Ops continues to support and fund work that FDD relies on (DevOps, Consulting, Accounting, etc.)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>again… staking is not a very well thought out solution, slashing GIA will only harm the ecosystem and make the review process:</p>
<ol>
<li>take significantly longer</li>
<li>require a good deal of human training/inconsistent grant reviews</li>
<li>cost more to pay for human expert grant reviews</li>
<li>the same amount of centralized (if not – more)</li>
<li>inhibit our ability to do finer grained data analysis of the grant-reviewal process</li>

            <p>Great discussion going on here that is answering questions for many.  Thank you Kyle for challenging the fdd to be fully accountable to the the community and ensuring the excess gets trimmed. It is pushback like that which make for an accurate and lean budget.  Every workstream should be trying to provide and solicit feedback like this imo.  I have a few thoughts and comments provided below.  Looking forward to seeing you around and sharing the latest fdd news.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, have we considered requiring 25 DAI to be staked per new grant request to help increase the fraud tax on this process?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes we have considered it.  The idea first arose when thinking about how to hold folks accountable for ‘bad’ or exploitative behaviour as dao members.  This got expanded to ecosystem participants.  By taking a stake from new grant applicants (AND potentially EVERY dao member) we now have an ability to incentivize and shape behaviors within the dao.  But carrying out these types of thought experiments has a cost.  It seems like the FDD is being told “No you are not meant to be innovating.  Your budget is inflated because of un-needed  R&amp;D” while in the very next breath we are being asked “where is the innovation?”</p>
<p>And although such discussions about innovation happen regularly we are mostly focused on carrying out the mission as inherited from Gitcoin inc.  We simply lack the people needed to successfully complete the mission while conducting major R &amp; D.  But we are continuously growing and filling out gaps in our range of sme.  The targeted strategy sessions guided us as a team toward filtering out the weak results from our future goals.</p>
<p>The fact FDD has been a great steward of its budgets demonstrates competence and responsibility.  This should be reason to increase the FDD budget not decrease it.  The FDD is good with its treasury and they are eager to enlarge the mission focus.  I want to see the FDD continue to grow and improve.  It was said PGF might be the heart and soul of Gitcoin.  Ouch.  Well maybe that would make the FDD the liver?  We filter out the junk?</p>
<p>Either way, it is hard for me to label any one group as the ‘heart’ of Gitcoin.  It is more of a vibe or a philosophy.  But I do know the FDD team is stronger than ever, and ready to carry out the Gitcoin mission.</p>
<p>Full support for this budget.   And a sweet dCompass quest.</p>
<p>Joe is a public ‘great’ (nice one Ben) and we are living in the proof.  The Dao is maturing nicely.  Membership is growing and the folks i’m seeing are very qualified.</p>
<p>Full support for this budget.  <em>Bias disclaimer:  I am part of this crew.</em></p>
