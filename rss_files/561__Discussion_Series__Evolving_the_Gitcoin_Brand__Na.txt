https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-series-evolving-the-gitcoin-brand-naming-our-protocols-products/12500
    # TLDR

### In the last Gitcoin Community Call of 2022, we had a community discussion around naming our protocols and the products we’re building on top of them (or, the dApps being integrated with them that will be used by program managers, builders/project owners, and donors. Now that we are gearing up to actually launch the protocols, it’s time to give them final names, so we're looking for feedback on our top contenders.

### The presentation from this session can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18MjIG2LY0Jop3QTmQRgomRogEH9ZtSDpYeCB2sc9fhE/edit#slide=id.g1b17276766e_0_465) - and has some helpful additional context

### Why we’re here:

* As Gitcoin continues to evolve, we’re taking the opportunity to examine our brand (across different expressions (from visual to verbal to experiential).
* We’re looking for feedback from the community on the work being done across workstreams and led by MMM. **This post is about naming, and aims to gather feedback on final names being considered for:**
  * The set of dApps running on our protocols, working name **Grants Suite**, latest name **Grants Stack**
  * Our protocol that enables groups to pool and allocate funds to support their collective goals, currently called **Grants Protocol**
  * Our protocol that empowers project owners to build a project profile, grow their reputation and apply for funding, currently called **Project Protocol**
* So far, there have been three other posts in this series:
  * An explanation of key definitions like Brand and Brand Strategy then walks through the foundational work leading up to the synthesis of the Brand Strategy, which can be found [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-series-evolving-the-gitcoin-brand-introduction-overview/12164).
  * A post soliciting feedback on Brand Vision, Brand Mission and Brand Values, which can be found [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-series-evolving-the-gitcoin-brand-mission-vision-values/12255/6).
  * A post soliciting feedback on our Brand Personality, Voice & Tone, which can be found [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-series-evolving-the-gitcoin-brand-brand-personality-brand-voice-brand-tone/12316/2).

### Specifically, we’d love your feedback on:

* **Approach**: How we’ve approached the naming process and the philosophy behind naming selection
* **Top Selects:** The short list of names in the running for Grants Protocol and Project Protocol
* **Anything Missing:** Names you like that you think we’ve missed
* And, if you have time, take a look at the **current naming brainstorm** [here](https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/Protocol-DApps-Naming-OPEN-2a67f09df86348988b30e1ed45a2af15)
* **We are aiming to align on final names by end of next week, Jan 13 - although this is not a hard and fast deadline, we’d greatly appreciate if you left feedback by EOD Jan 12!**

### Anything else?

* The **current naming brainstorm** can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/Protocol-DApps-Naming-OPEN-2a67f09df86348988b30e1ed45a2af15) and is open for input, but we ask that you please leave feedback on the governance forum
* In addition to discussion and feedback here, we welcome additional discussion feedback in the #brand-pod channel in the Discord.

# Defining our Approach To Naming

What goes into developing a successful product naming strategy?

First and foremost, it's important to understand the **target audienc**e for the product. The name should appeal to and make sense for this group.

It's also important to consider the product's **positioning** within the market and the overall brand.

In addition to considering the target audience, positioning, and overall brand image, it's also important to consider the **brand's mission, vision, values, and personality** when developing a product naming strategy - hence why naming has come as a later stage.

**In summary, our criteria for deciding on a name looks like this:**

* **Audience Aligned:** The name will resonate with the target audience.
* **Value Prop Aligned:** The name should effectively communicate the product’s value proposition.
* **Positioning Aligned:** The name fits the overall product positioning within the market and within the overall brand (e.g., harmonizes/does not conflict with the brand name or other product names)
* **Vision Aligned:** The name should align with the brand's long-term goals and help to bring the vision to life
* **Mission Aligned:** The name should align with the brand's mission and purpose
* **Values Aligned**: The name should reflect the brand's beliefs and principles, and should appeal to people who share those values.
* **Personality Aligned**: The name should fit within the overall tone and aesthetic of the brand, and should effectively communicate the brand's personality.

We also outlined some secondary creative considerations to gut check ourselves once we landed on top names, which included:

* **Cohesiveness:** Names that feel like a “set.”
* **Independence:** Names that can standalone and feel just as strong as when used together
* **Pronunciation:** Easy across languages
* **Ownable:** Not infringing on names of other products/protocols in our space

And specifically, one more consideration for the protocols:

* **Openness:** Protocol names that give a sense of flexibility, customizability, and possibility
* **No Use of Protocol:** Protocol names that don’t need to have “Protocol” in them or following them (e.g., we call Lens, Lens - not always Lens Protocol)

# Types of Names

There are several different types of names to consider when naming a product.

![|720x268](upload://k5ClcWWvIurtutwsm0Jk8SWdNh6.png)

* **Descriptive names** clearly and directly describe the product and its function, such as "Sunscreen Lotion" or "Quick-Dry Towel." These types of names can be useful for new and innovative products, as they help the consumer understand what the product does right away. However, they can be limiting and may not allow for much brand personality.
* On the other end of the spectrum are **invented or abstract names**, which are more creative and memorable but may be harder for the consumer to understand. Examples include "Nike" and "Apple." These types of names allow for more brand personality and can be effective for established brands, but may not be as effective for new products as they may be harder for the consumer to understand.
* Another option is to use a **combination of bot**h, such as "Hair Food" or "Life Water." These types of names provide a hint at the product's function while also allowing for some creative branding.

**Other Considerations**

**Product vs. Brand Name:** Another important consideration when developing a product naming strategy is how the brand and product names fit together. A strong brand name can be a powerful asset, and the product name should complement and support the brand name rather than overshadowing it.

For example, if the brand name is more evocative and memorable, the product name may be more functional and descriptive to clearly communicate the product's value and purpose. On the other hand, **if the brand name is more functional and descriptive, the product name may be more creative and memorable to add personality and stand out in the market.**

It's also important to consider **how the product name will fit within the overall brand name and product portfolio.** The product name should fit within the naming system and structure established by the brand, and should not conflict with any other products within the portfolio.

It's also important to consider **the product's potential expansion and how the name will fit within the brand's overall product portfolio.** The name should fit within the brand's overall messaging and aesthetic, and should not conflict with any other products within the portfolio.

This is where **brand and product architecture come into play**. A strong brand architecture helps to clearly define the relationship between products within a portfolio and how they fit within the overall brand. This can include creating a naming system, such as using a specific word or phrase in all product names, or using a specific naming structure (e.g. all names starting with the letter "S").

# Naming Grants Stack, formerly known as Grants Suite

**This brings us to our first name: The set of dApps running on our protocols, working name Grants Suite.**

Grants Stack is the first-ever solution connecting grants program managers, donors, and project owners to launch, participate, and scale community-powered grants programs. It enables a streamlined process from program deployment to application management to funds allocation, encourages donor discovery and support of projects, and empowers builder participation and reputation building.

**Most recently, we began socializing Grants Stack as the new and updated name. Why? Let’s check against our criteria.**

* **Audience Aligned:** The name will resonate with the target audience - **CHECK**
* **Value Prop Aligned:** The name should effectively communicate the product’s value proposition. - **CHECK**
* **Positioning Aligned:** The name fits the overall product positioning within the market and within the overall brand (e.g., harmonizes/does not conflict with the brand name or other product names) - **CHECK**
* **Vision Aligned**: The name should align with the brand's long-term goals and help to bring the vision to life - **CHECK**
* **Mission Aligned:** The name should align with the brand's mission and purpose - **CHECK**
* **Values Aligned**: The name should reflect the brand's beliefs and principles, and should appeal to people who share those values. - **CHECK**
* **Personality Aligned**: The name should fit within the overall tone and aesthetic of the brand, and should effectively communicate the brand's personality. - **CHECK**
* **Pronunciation:** Easy - **CHECK**
* **Ownable**: No one else in our space currently using it; while it’s not trademarkable, it’s highly descriptive, so less important here - **CHECK**

For the first half of these, here’s what we looked at:

* **Audience**: Our primary target audience for this set of tools is program managers; the tools will also be used by builders/project owners and donors, but the program managers will be a main driver in getting them to use - thus keeping GRANTS in the name is valuable
* **Value Prop**: The value proposition for this set of tools of course varies by audience, but for our core audience, program managers, the value is that this is the first comprehensive solution that enables them to create and scale a program, plus engage/encourage donors and empower project leaders - thus STACK makes sense as a descriptor for these tools
* **Positioning:** Similar to the value proposition, we’re positioning this as the only end to end solution, and this name signals the comprehensiveness of this set of tools; we also want this name to signal intuitiveness, reliability, impact, so keeping the name direct and descriptive helps us achieve this

For more reasoning on the second half, take a look back at past posts about Mission, Vision, Values and Personality and you’ll see how this name fits with those as well.

You may be wondering what happened to previous names: Grants Manager, Grants Explorer, and Grants Hub. Grants Stack is comprised of several dApps built on top of our new protocols plus the Passport integration. These names were for those individual dApps. For now, we’ve aligned to not name the individual dApps, but instead speak to their functionality in the context of the Grants Stack (Manager, Explorer and Builder.) We will no longer be referring to the individual dApp names (although it’s likely just out of habit those names will continue to come up - but we’ll be socializing a robust glossary soon that will reinforce the transition away from these.)

You might also be wondering why we don’t mention our new protocols - or why they aren’t part of the naming of the Grants Stack. We’ve aligned on not going too far into the underlying tech powering these dApps, as that will be part of the protocol marketing strategy, which is more focused on ecosystem partners and developers at this stage. For this reason, we are thinking about the Grants Stack name separately from the protocol names.

More will be shared around this thinking in a very near future governance post about Grants Stack Marketing.

Again, we’re encouraging feedback here - would love all thoughts on the Grants Stack name.

# Naming Grants Protocol

**This brings us to our second name: our protocol that enables groups to pool and allocate funds to support their collective goals, currently called Grants Protocol.**

As a reminder, this protocol is an open, permissionless protocol that enables and scales community-led funding systems by allowing groups to pool resources and build funding mechanisms that are uniquely tailored to their needs. It will allow for more efficient, democratic distribution of funds through a variety of mechanisms in the long term. For now, our primary audience is developers who want to build on the protocol. Grants Protocol powers two main functions of the Grants Stack - the Manager and Explorer functions.

We kicked off the naming process with a cross-workstream brainstorming session, which looked like this:

![|720x475](upload://mxkeHXSTDxQxnS9VUplqtHRd7Cq.png)

We then opened up additional brainstorming prior to our Community Call naming session.

Over the holidays, we gave community members the opportunity to add to this brainstorm here, and then cast a vote.

The short list of names for Grants Protocol came down to:

* **Alo Protocol: Evocative**; Alo means feed, rear, cherish, educate, sustain in Latin and is also short for “allocate”
* **Allocate Protocol:** Descriptive; tied to core functionality of the protocol which is helping to allocate funds to communities building shared needs
* **Stream Protocol:** Evocative; stream suggests a flow of capital but also ties into the more nature-inspired elements of our brands like biomimicry and mycelial networks
* **Pollen Protocol:** Evocative; similar to stream, pollen suggest pollination, essential to germination and growth similar to funding for community projects and also ties to the nature-inspired elements of our brand
* **Plurality Protocol:** A blend between descriptive and evocative; helps describe our pluralistic tool that is the protocol and simultaneously signals our intention to showcase many and ties into our overall mission and vision

To be clear, there were not an overwhelming number of votes. But it’s time to name these protocols, because they are launching.

So here, I encourage you to go back to our criteria and evaluate these names against those for yourself.

At first glance, most pass the criteria. The key concerns I have are:

* Alo being latin vs. just using Allo which comes from the English
* Allocate being too on the nose
* Stream sounding like it relates to a streaming/music service
* Pollen already being used for a DeFi protocol
* Plurality losing its impact if not paired with Protocol after it
* Descriptive vs. Evocative naming in general - is one better than the other for encouraging devs to build? There are certainly different opinions

Given that Alo has the most votes, I am encouraging us to consider Alo vs. Allo.

I also encourage you to consider this as part the Gitcoin protocol portfolio, which includes Passport and will also include whatever we name Project Protocol.

Rather than running down the list of criteria and evaluation here, will let you do that on your own and leave feedback in the comments section.

# Naming Project Protocol

**This brings us to our third name: our protocol that empowers project owners to build a project profile, grow their reputation and apply for funding, currently called Project Protocol**

As a reminder, this a decentralized registry of projects designed to empower project owners to grow their online reputation, demonstrate impact and connect with funding to bring their vision to life - all with sovereign ownership of their data. It acts as a project’s single home where project owners can integrate their most up-to-date information to easily access resources they need to thrive. Concurrently, the protocol can act as a repository in which funders can source and validate trustworthy, impactful projects that will help grow their ecosystem. For now, our primary audience is developers who want to build on the protocol. Grants Protocol powers a main function of the Grants Stack - the Builder function (previously known as Grants Hub.)

Project Protocol was part of the same process.

![|696x622](upload://ccHalJ6vG1t2J7g0q3UTS5cAuW9.png)

**The short list of names for Project Protocol came down to:**

* **Node [Protocol]:** Evocative; In botany, the part of a plant stem from which one or more leaves emerge; in tech, a point at which lines or pathways intersect or branch; a central or connecting point; alludes to the protocol proposition as this being a hub empowering project owners to create a single profile they can then use to establish reputation
* **Seed [Protocol]:** Evocative; in botany, the embryonic stage of the plant life cycle, suggesting a starting point from which everything blooms; alludes to the value proposition of being an essential starting point for project growth
*  **Base [Protocol]:** Descriptive: a conceptual structure or entity on which something draws or depends, a foundational structure; ties into the core functionality of the protocol serving as a hub for projects

Interestingly, none of these were originally followed with “Protocol” in the original brainstorm. There were also many other descriptive names that had a couple of votes, like Project Hub Protocol and Project Registry.

**Again, I encourage you to go back to our criteria and evaluate these names against those for yourself.**

At first glance, most pass the criteria. The key concern I have is Seed being owned by our friends at Seed Club. Additionally, considering the common association between seed and capital (e.g., seed funding), it feels to me like a better fit for our Grants Protocol. But regardless, I’d worry about us using it. As with Grants Protocol, I’m also still wondering about the Descriptive vs. Evocative question.

Here it again becomes important to consider this name alongside our other protocols, and to consider the aforementioned proposed names for Grants Protocol as well as our existing Passport.

As before, rather than running down the list of criteria and evaluation here, will let you do that on your own and leave feedback in the comments section.

# Next Steps

**Are the names here? I’m not sure.** Personally, I would love to see more options and a robust discussion here. We already have Passport - it’s simultaneously evocative and descriptive. It’s not a literal passport - but the name alludes to what it does, while also describing it as a tool.

Does Allo do that? Does Node do that? No. Names that would align with Passport would be things like Wallet or Bank, Hub or Home.

If we go with a latin name for one, should they all be Latin? Honestly, it probably doesn’t matter - we don’t need to be rigid.

The point of this post is to lay out the considerations and the criteria so you can evaluate and give feedback for us to consider as we evaluate next steps. We will likely not have a vote here on the forum, but again, feedback here will help determine that.

**We are aiming to align on final names by end of next week, Jan 13 - although this is not a hard and fast deadline, we’d greatly appreciate if you left feedback by EOD Jan 12!**

ALSO! You might be wondering when we’ll be sharing the most up to date information on Grants Stack and the other protocols - this will be shared in forthcoming governance posts in the next week.

# Share your feedback!

**We are aiming to align on final names by end of next week, Jan 13 - although this is not a hard and fast deadline, we’d greatly appreciate if you left feedback by EOD Jan 12!**

# Looking for additional context? Here’s a quick reminder of how we got here and our objectives of this work

After months of foundational work that included reviewing past iterations of our mission and vision, speaking with different community members and thought leaders, surveying stakeholder audiences completed, and coming back together to synthesize, we started to distill key pieces of our Brand Strategy (as a reminder, you can learn more about Brand and Brand Strategy in the last governance post in this series, [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-series-evolving-the-gitcoin-brand-introduction-overview/12164).)

The Brand Strategy is not meant to be overly prescriptive. Rather, it aims to offer a framework as well as a set of tools that should give contributors and the community a clear sense of direction. It also helps to inform design development and decisions.

Our intent is to develop a Brand Strategy that builds upon our existing Brand Purpose, creating a cohesive Brand Narrative - giving us more clarity around key strategic elements and considerations that can inform the evolution of our visual identity.

In its entirety, the Brand Strategy will define vision, mission, core principles, and strategic approaches for the foreseeable future (until another revision is deemed necessary by the community). The aim is to align the DAO around a set of common values and objectives so we can collectively do a better job in allocating resources, setting priorities, executing, and evolving towards a shared “North Star.”

alexalombardo

            <p>Hey everyone! As some of you may have heard, after much discussion around this feedback, MMM and GPC aligned on two final names: <strong>Grants Stack</strong> (for the set of dApps that act as the interface(s) for our protocols) and <strong>Allo Protocol</strong> (for Grants Protocol.)</p>
<p>We feel these names are <strong>mission aligned</strong>, <strong>positioning aligned,</strong> <strong>audience aligned</strong>, and <strong>values aligned</strong>. Additionally, both are <strong>easy to pronounce</strong>, to <strong>read/write</strong>, and in the case of Allo, is <strong>ownable</strong> if we choose to trademark it in the future (since Google has abandoned theirs.)</p>
<p>Next up, I want to share some additional background on the selection of <strong>Allo Protocol</strong>** specifically. Beyond aligning with our original naming criteria, this name adequately addresses many of the points made here around function and brand.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Function Forward/Descriptive:</strong> It is a direct shorthand for allocate or allocation; thus it directly communicates the primary function, the distribution (resources or duties) for a particular purpose (this is the definition of allocation, and the definition of allocate is TO distribute resources or duties for a particular purpose); we will be dialing up the use of the word allocation in other marketing materials including the marketing brief to ensure this correlation is crystal clear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mission/Vision/Worldbuilding:</strong> Allo and the concept of allocate/allocation ties into our overall mission of empowering the funding/building of shared needs; additionally, it connects to our overarching vision for a better world; if we think about it in the context of existing names, it also complements Passport well (passport being your passport to this world, and allocation being the way you get the funds you need to build what you need to get there) - so in this sense it still maps to the Quadratic Lands meme while simultaneously not undermining the biomemetic magic concept we’re exploring as the evolved brand direction (more info will be shared this week on the brand evolution work)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We felt it was important to give this protocol a name separate from Gitcoin, since the Gitcoin brand is already so much bigger in mission, vision and product landscape vs. that of this particular protocol.</p>
<p>That said, we do intend to leverage the credibility and equity of the Gitcoin name across all of our protocols - some of this will be accomplished through certain shared aspects of our overarching Gitcoin brand identity, but will also be done with intentional copy (e.g., saying Gitcoin Allo Protocol when introducing it for the first time, or eventually saying Allo Protocol by Gitcoin - again, more to come here as we finesse these details)</p>
<p>Next up we are working on a <strong>glossary of terms</strong> that will further clarify naming and copy conventions. We will also be sharing updated product information for the <strong>Grants Stack</strong> and <strong>Allo Protocol</strong>.</p>
<p>You might be wondering - what happened to <strong>Project Protocol?</strong> For now, as the protocol is in its infancy, it will continue to live almost as part of <strong>Allo Protocol</strong> until it is ready to be spun out (I welcome <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/nategosselin">@nategosselin</a>, <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/michelle_ma">@michelle_ma</a>, <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle">@kyle</a>, <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kevin.olsen">@kevin.olsen</a> to elaborate here!)</p>
<p>Moving forward, we hope to leave even more time for discussion and consideration around things like names and greatly appreciate your continued input!</p>

            <p>So to summarize, the distinction between the two</p>
<p>Grants Protocol: (assuming the grants rounds will be run here)<br>
A place for pooling resources + community-allocated funding to support projects</p>
<p>vs</p>
<p>Project Protocol:<br>
A place where owners store their project information, build reputation, &amp; apply to various funding rounds</p>
<p>To me, the two products described above are both software which directly compliment each other in the same vertical–decentralized, community-oriented funding in web3.</p>
<p>A similar comparison to Alphabet’s software offerings could be Google Pay (payment system) vs Google Drive (file storage). They can interact, stand alone, but both still contain Google in the same because they both serve the web-based software vertical.</p>
<p>Looking at the slide deck, I can see the argument for Alphabet’s Platform Branding structure, but please remember the company was called Google until 2015, when <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/081115/why-google-became-alphabet.asp#:~:text=As%20a%20parent%20company%2C%20Alphabet,income%20streams%20from%20various%20subsidiaries." rel="noopener nofollow ugc">they began acquiring different companies in order to expand their brand across untouched verticals</a>.</p>
<p>However, even in 2023, if you take a look at Google’s product offerings, <a href="https://about.google/products/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">the most recognized/popular apps on here all have G or Google in the name</a>. We can see that the product names directly appeal to user recognition of Google’s historical reputation by explicitly including Google or G before the function–Gmail, GSuite, Google Maps–and it has been instrumental in each product’s smooth adoption.</p>
<p>Also note the other sub brands under Alphabet occupy extremely distinct verticals–ex: Calico - biotech,  Verily - research, Google - software, Nest - hardware, GV - ventures.</p>
<p>It took us years to develop the Gitcoin Grants Protocol, and even longer to create a uniquely positive-sum reputation in this chaotic space. Although I have no doubt we have a great roadmap of incoming products, we should first  focus on making this current product suite as successful as possible, not trying to prepare for future products that haven’t even been made yet. As someone who interacts frequently with builders in this space (&amp; I’m sure many contributors relate to this experience), the way people’s face light up when you mention working with Gitcoin <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/star_struck.png?v=12" title=":star_struck:" class="emoji" alt=":star_struck:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/heart_eyes.png?v=12" title=":heart_eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":heart_eyes:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> feels incredible and makes me really proud to represent this DAO!</p>
<p>Although Gitcoin has existed in the ecosystem for a considerable bit of time, zooming out, we are still incredibly young in our business stage having been founded in 2017. Would warn against imitating the actions of these web2 titans who have been going through many business cycles, product launches, and acquisition since the 90’s/00’s.</p>
<p>It would be a shame if premature branding additions diluted the Gitcoin brand, because we have been the forerunners in decentralized funding space. Definitely an OG blue chip brand in web3 funding at this point. Many projects/teams in this space will jump at the opportunity to use Gitcoin-branded, created, tested, &amp; approved software. The branded house structure like Adobe’s or Google’s native apps makes the most sense right now given our product suite offerings + current reputation at this time.</p>
<p>But also noticed we already lowkey have a Platform Brand structure with Schelling Point (distinctly different vertical–irl conference event) and supermodular? both not explicitly mentioning Gitcoin in the name (although frequently interacting w/ Gitcoin communities &amp; causes). Although these web2 brand structures are great examples for us to learn and draw inspiration from, we don’t need to imitate. Gitcoin is a unique, recognizable brand name that has plenty of mileage left IMHO.</p>

[Discussion Series] Evolving the Gitcoin Brand: Naming our Protocols & Products
alexalombardo

            <p>As we move from being an Impact DAO to an Impact and Protocol DAO, our product roadmap will continue to evolve.</p>
<p>With these protocols being intertwined but also able to standalone (and have more funding mechanisms than QF and go beyond just grants,) the thinking was around giving them distictive names and identtities .</p>
<p>If you take a look at the original post, Grants Protocol is all about pooling resources and community allocated funding, whereas Project Protocol is more a project hub where project owners can store information, build reputation and apply to rounds. While we will likely not fully “market” Project Protocol at this early stage in time, there is a potential future where this will be an entirely separate protocol with many other applications beyond being part of running a grants program, and therefore we have been exploring giving it its own name.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, with this new name that will be decided upon–will that entail new branding? I wonder if that would be the best use of resources, vs improving on the microsite / interviewing / fine-tuning our current brand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This work is already underway and encourage you to take a look at the docs/links cited in the original post to follow along with the brand evolution work</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I worry that a new name will confuse partners–are we offering a new product? What is the value-add of this new name, and what is the purpose to separate it from our well-established Gitcoin brand?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gitcoin the brand will still very much be a container for these other “products” - our protocols and programs - in the same way Adobe or, for example, is a container for their sub-brands/products.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we’re trying to use this to help name the product suite like Round Manager, Grants Hub, Explorer–my two cents would be to keep Gitcoin and add flair to the product names, like Gitcoin Bibliotheque, Gitcoin Kontrol Center, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’re not seeking to name anything beyond Grants Stack, Grants Protocol and Project Protocol currently.</p>
<p>Appreciate your further suggestions regarding names - feel free to add them into the Notion <a href="https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/Protocol-DApps-Naming-OPEN-2a67f09df86348988b30e1ed45a2af15" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a></p>

<p>Thanks very much for the reply. So can you help me imagine out how I would describe this to grantees. They would go to Alo to set up their grants and Node would be where donors go to donate?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of this will be shared as part of the forthcoming marketing updates around Grants Stack and Protocols.</p>
<p>Additionally, there will be a glossary circulated for further clarification in upcoming weeks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the Round Managers would be using Node to make decisions about which grants are in the round? No distinct name to differentiate the back end? I suppose in a sense they could think of it as the admin panel for their round even though its actually a different site?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the front end side of things, Round Managers, Donors and Project Builders are all engaging with Grants Stack, which is the interface(s) built on the protocols. The domain names will likely not include protocol names. We will need to sort the back end out with GPC.</p>
<p>Would the tweet to potential donors be go the the Gitcoin Node page for the climate round here: node. gitcoin. co/climate (or whatever it is) ?</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Again, this will be further sorted once names are selected, but the protocol name does not need to be in the domain (for example, we currently have <a href="http://grantshub.gitcoin.co" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">grantshub.gitcoin.co</a> - grants hub is the dApp built on what we have been calling Project Protocol)</p>
<p>We will share updates on the domain names soon.</p>

            <p>Is there a reason we’re trying to separate the Gitcoin brand from the new grants protocol with this new name?</p>
<p>We are offering the same thing as we have in the past-- a quadratic-funding mechanism – just properly decentralized into a protocol product rather than manually running thru our team on cGrants. It’s doing the exact same thing as we were, but automated.</p>
<p>To me, this is a confusing step to take. I can understand in branding situations like Lens separating from Aave, so that they could take their respective spaces in socialfi and defi. Those are two completely different products in who occupy different web3 verticals.</p>
<p>If someone could explain the need for the separation of Gitcoin and “Base/Project/Alo/etc.” [Protocol] it would definitely help me contribute more meaningfully to this naming discussion.</p>
<p>Also, with this new name that will be decided upon–will that entail new branding? I wonder if that would be the best use of resources, vs improving on the microsite / interviewing / fine-tuning our current brand.</p>

            <p>I like Base too. Although it kinda reminds me a bit too much of Basecamp which is a pretty popular scheduling tool (as well as a company that does a lot of content creation about remote working and coordination). So we would need to somehow navigate that.</p>
<p>My primary thing here really is just being clear. I hate to be negative (especially as a Canadian… sorry). Just a bit worried about how we communicate this clearly to community members. Often things sound and feel different when you start trying to explain it to a potential user of the tools.</p>

            <p>Thanks for all the work that has been put into this discussion.</p>
<p>I think Grants Stack is great.</p>
<p>I think my favorite of what I have read is <strong>Base</strong> for the Project Protocol. I go to my Base to strategize and prepare as a grantee.</p>
<p>Base also makes me think of a Basecamp. That took my mind to an <strong>Expedition</strong>.  Groups pool and allocate funds into an Expedition and Grantees start at the Base(camp) and go on Expeditions.</p>
<p>Other thoughts along this line of thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Campaign (for all the D&amp;D players)</li>
<li>Mission</li>
<li>Adventure</li>
<li>Voyage</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I want to add to what Ben voiced above. We need to think about how this is described in public. Currently, in the Climate Alpha Round, we have a lot of confusion about the Hub and Explorer and what each is for. Grantees go and set up a grant and assume they are done and aren’t trained yet to think now I need to take this grant and apply to the ______ Grant Round Protocol. The names are important but they play heavily into how we describe the overall Grants Stack to the public.</p>

            <p>Great thoughts here - we will DEFINITELY be having one liners/headlines for the Stack and the Protocols.</p>
<p>With regard to Grants Hub/Grants Explorer - we won’t be using these names anymore, per my initial note. We will be referring to the different functions within the Grants Stack - but it will all be Grants Stack.</p>
<p>See info from my original post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may be wondering what happened to previous names: Grants Manager, Grants Explorer, and Grants Hub. Grants Stack is comprised of several dApps built on top of our new protocols plus the Passport integration. These names were for those individual dApps. For now, we’ve aligned to not name the individual dApps, but instead speak to their functionality in the context of the Grants Stack (Manager, Explorer and Builder.) We will no longer be referring to the individual dApp names (although it’s likely just out of habit those names will continue to come up - but we’ll be socializing a robust glossary soon that will reinforce the transition away from these.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You might also be wondering why we don’t mention our new protocols - or why they aren’t part of the naming of the Grants Stack. We’ve aligned on not going too far into the underlying tech powering these dApps, as that will be part of the protocol marketing strategy, which is more focused on ecosystem partners and developers at this stage. For this reason, we are thinking about the Grants Stack name separately from the protocol names.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In terms of domain names and navigation, we will look to amend these so it feels cohesive. Additionally, the visuals will also be cohesive across Grants Stack, so it will feel like a seamless experience. This will evolve much more once we are out of Alpha Rounds.</p>
<p>Additionally, the marketing of the Grants Protocol will be mainly directed at developers. In terms of how we message this to the end user, it will be more like “Grants Stack - built on our open, permissionless, modular protocols” and then the specifics about the Protocols can be accessed on our website, where devs can also access docs.</p>
<p>Hope this helps clarify.</p>

            <p>I’m wondering if we might want to use a creative name followed by a descriptive name to reduce confusion. For example Alo - The Gitcoin Grants Home Base. Or something like that which does a better job of describing what it does for the users.</p>
<p>I’m finding that grantees are already getting pretty confused between grants hub and grants explorer. Im worried we are going to have so many names and some of them not a clear description of the functionality that it will lead to even more confusion.</p>
<p>Not going to the same web page to create a grant that you do to apply to a round or donate to a round is going to have a learning curve for sure.</p>
<p>I wonder how these decisions will play themselves out in terms of domain names and the flow of traffic between things.</p>
<p>I’m a bit confused about which names are being changed and which are not.</p>
<p>Is Grants Hub still grants hub? Grants Explorer? Round Manager?</p>
<p>I see 3 proposed names here: Grants Stack (replacing grants suit), Alo (replacing grants protocol),  and Node replacing (project protocol).</p>
<p>Is the intention for these protocol names to all be public facing? Are the names for the protocols different than the names of the individual tools (and their associated domain names) within these protocols?</p>
<p>This honestly feels more confusing as opposed to easier to understand.</p>
<p>When describing this to grantees or donors on a twitter space what will they need to know what will we say. Go to grants hub to create your grant and then apply to the round in explorer? Donate to the round in explorer? Find opportunities to get involved in a round… somewhere?</p>
<p>As a round manager what do I need to know? Manage the round in round manager? Support grantees onboarding in grants hub and explorer?</p>
<p>The protocols are the overarching infrastructure connecting these pieces together into a cohesive whole. I get that and I’m excited about it. Maybe we are saying as a round manager you will have access to all the tools in the Gitcoin Grants Stack and these are connected using the Alo protocol and the Node protocol? Something like that?</p>
<p>Just trying to imagine how I will share information about these new names with our 3 different audiences and what they will need to know to participate.</p>

            <p>I like the name Grants Stack for sure.</p>
<p>Alo may confuse people a bit given the Google Allo product that they were pushing pretty hard in the last couple years before the ended it. <a href="https://allo.google.com/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://allo.google.com/</a></p>
<p>A bit of an up hill fight in terms of SEO. Also possibly a confusing spelling thing.</p>
<p>I agree with Kevin that names like Node that have other meanings to devs may create confusion. “If you confuse you lose”. Words to live by.</p>
<p>I will add more re the other names when I have a bit more time.</p>

            <p>I like the idea of using a physical metaphors as the basis of the protocol names, to provide a basis for similar metaphors that can be used throughout UX writing to make the functionality of the product easier to understand, like “stamp” for Passport.</p>
<p>Taking into account <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/birdsoar">@birdsoar</a> ’s Gitcoin Design Matrix, I think it’s important to lean towards more futuristic names in order to encourage action as Alexa suggested, since Grants Stack requires a lot of coordination, organizing, and governance  to implement.</p>
<p>Adding onto the suggestions for infrastructure &amp; action-related words mentioned by Alexa:</p>
<p>Grants Protocol</p>
<ul>
<li>I like allo and stream, but allo is close to Alo Yoga and Stream is close to Superfluid Streams</li>
<li>+1 to Arbor and Copia from previous suggestions</li>
<li>Other suggestions
<ul>
<li>Circulate / Circularity</li>
<li>Causa
<ul>
<li>Part of the word for chance in Catalan</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Backer</li>
<li>Commons</li>
<li>Cord
<ul>
<li>Reference to tying together community needs, leadership, and builders</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Project Protocol</p>
<ul>
<li>+1 to Node Protocol due to its descriptive nature and, out of the original proposals, it best reflects the aspect of connection between builders and program owners / ecosystem leaders that Project Protocol allows</li>
<li>Other suggestions:
<ul>
<li>Pulse
<ul>
<li>Reference to project protocol as a form of community intelligence for program managers, a way to keep a pulse on what the community wants</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Evolve</li>
<li>Compass (also the name of a real estate company)
<ul>
<li>Reference to project protocol as a way for builders to figure out the right direction for their projects to grow</li>

            <p>Wow. Blown away by the level of thought, detail and overall effort that has gone into this. I feel like I just earned a degree in marketing.</p>
<p>I love Grant Stack. Clear and concise.</p>
<p>I don’t like Alo based on my previous roles in web3. It rings like Allocation for VCs, private, strategic rounds. Many in the space might make the same connection. We’d have to do lots of storytelling to deliver the growth and development story of <strong>Alō</strong>.</p>

[Discussion Series] Evolving the Gitcoin Brand: Naming our Protocols & Products
birdsoar

            <p>Hi everyone, it’s great to see so much discussion happening around names. I’ve been leaning into autonomy on this particular subject, and want to float ideas as our discussion evolves.</p>
<p>There are some excellent points above around creating compelling names in parallel to some of our close collaborators. I agree with that approach. Names can be unique, descriptive, and playful or serious (depending on context). Achieving all of this in one word is possible, and where we probably want to land.</p>
<p>Before diving into to specific names, I’m thinking through this conceptually and want to share ideas around how we can leverage the evolving brand as a framework.</p>
<p>To me, Quadratic Lands is solely a community-building piece of lore. Although the mechanism of QF is deeply rooted in our product suite, the lands themselves are about <em>being a utopia</em>. In contrast, our products and protocols are about providing the structure and support required to make that utopia come true.</p>
<p>If we look at this from the lens of the evolving brand visuals that our designs reflect, we already have a framework for making conceptual brand decisions:</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/4/4b46356e619913a7914accb00c498309ad1fd0ca.jpeg" data-download-href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/4b46356e619913a7914accb00c498309ad1fd0ca" title="31"><img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/4/4b46356e619913a7914accb00c498309ad1fd0ca_2_690x388.jpeg" alt="31" data-base62-sha1="aJUemTBA1FAubYKK5h1M7icqtRg" width="690" height="388" srcset="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/4/4b46356e619913a7914accb00c498309ad1fd0ca_2_690x388.jpeg, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/4/4b46356e619913a7914accb00c498309ad1fd0ca_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/4/4b46356e619913a7914accb00c498309ad1fd0ca_2_1380x776.jpeg 2x" data-dominant-color="FAFAF9"></a></div><p></p>
<p>I acknowledge that this is a work in progress, and iirc <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/etovardesign">@Etovardesign</a> has ideas for how to translate this framework with a product focus.</p>
<p>Still, it’s worth filtering the name options through this framework to see where things land - is the name futuristic? optimistic? earth-aligned? regenerative? etc. All of this helps us relate with the biomemetic magic theme.</p>

<p>Something that <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation">@ceresstation</a> suggested in a DM is to rework the way we use “aqueduct” (as I know that was a product we tried but I think are officially sunsetting</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I dont think we have decided to sunset Aquaducts… I think we just didnt actually get them off the ground yet (though we have some commitments for Aqueducts that may materialize).</p>
<p>The original Gitcoin Aqueduct was described and built to solve the Uniswap problem - “How might we convince Uniswap to donate 5% of their treasury to public goods for Gitcoin Grantees?” The solution was go back in time and have them commit before their treasury was worth billions (Though Badger did this, and then backed out of the deal… which is whole other story). The thinking was to find a simple and easy way that DAO/protocols could commit 5% of their treasury early in their project lifecycle and have those stream to a matching pool (technically two) to be used for public goods.</p>
<p>So, an aqueduct helps direct some % of funds to a public goods matching pool that grow’s that ecosystem and Public goods more broadly.</p>
<p>I really the idea of working QL back into the narrative. The message was always so powerful. Grant’s stack also really resonates given its simplicity and optionality. it makes me want to learn more… “Oooh! whats in the grants stack? does it have funding? Does it have a direct grants program? etc.”</p>
<p>As for each of the protocols, I am rather impartial on what we call the protocols themselves (and have been fine with Grants Protocol (with round manager, and grants explorer as our first dApps), Project Protocol (with Grants Hub as the dApp)</p>

<p>I agree!</p>
<p>On a somewhat related note:</p>
<p>I like the idea of a fruit bearing tree…which is a visual we’ve used before to communicate what it is we’re doing.</p>
<p>Just spent some time looking into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_tree" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">World Tree</a> (which is a concept replicated across many cultures) which could be cool.</p>
<p>Arbor Protocol</p>
<p>Also like Orchard.<br>
Unfortunately Fountain is already taken…i think that would have been a good one. Garden is also taken. Coincidentally, DeFi protocol communities seem to really like nature lol.</p>

my mind went to some of the primary flora in the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_Gardens_of_Babylon" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">hanging gardens of babylon</a>” , eg:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Olive</a> (<em>Olea europaea</em>)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quince" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Quince</a> (<em>Cydonia oblonga</em>)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrus_communis" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Common pear</a> (<em>Pyrus communis</em>)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fig" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Fig</a> (<em>Ficus carica</em>)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almond" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Almond</a> (<em>Prunus dulcis</em>)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitis_vinifera" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Common grape vine</a> (<em>Vitis vinifera</em>)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_palm" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Date palm</a> (<em>Phoenix dactylifera</em>)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamarix_aphylla" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Athel tamarisk</a> (<em>Tamarix aphylla</em>)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistacia_atlantica" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Mt. Atlas mastic tree</a> (<em>Pistacia atlantica</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>names like <em>Olea</em>, <em>Quince</em>, <em>Pyrus</em>, <em>Ficus</em>, <em>Phoenix</em>, <em>Vitis</em> are some of the ones that stand out to me!</p>

            <p>I really love this QL framework as an anchor point for the naming — it feels like it opens up a lot of design possibilities.</p>
<p>If we go this route, though, I think we should try to steer more towards solarpunk / future cities / biome-style names as opposed to terms that feel more like industrial infrastructure.</p>
<p>Grants protocol as a place that resources / nourishes feels super powerful. The food-oriented names are jumping out at me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fountain</li>
<li>Spring</li>
<li>Garden</li>
<li>Larder</li>
<li>Provisions</li>
<li>Orchard</li>
</ul>
<p>Loving this new direction overall!</p>
