https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-are-the-grants-alpha-rounds-going/12501
    I like synthesizing information, so I put together this summary of the alpha rounds from [this post](https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/announcing-the-gitcoin-alpha-tests) and dune dashboards @ccerv1 put together.

# Past Rounds
| Project  |  Dates | Matching Pool | Crowdfund Donations | Crowdfund Unique Donors  | Dune Dashboard  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  UNICEF | Dec 9 - 21, 2022  | 50 ETH  | 67.52Îž + $14,788 DAI  | 15,507 |  [dune](https://dune.com/cerv1/gitcoin-unicef) |
| Fantom  | Dec 12, 2022 - Jan 2, 2023 | 125,000 FTM  | 294,299 FTM  | 16,344 |  [dune](https://dune.com/bravenoob21/fantom-gitcoin-grants-round-1) |
