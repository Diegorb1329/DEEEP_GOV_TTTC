## Key Financial Insights September

* **Total personnel costs**, including full-time team members, part-time support, and external consultants, amounted to $458,243. This represents an increase from the previous month's expenses of $448,490. The rise is attributed to a few positions that were not budgeted at the DAO level, as well as the additional costs associated with processing these positions through Deel.

* **Software & Subscriptions**: $10,250. This reflects a reduction of $10,864 from last month. However, it is slightly over budget due to an underestimation of AWS costs, which is currently under review and may be corrected.
* **Miscellaneous**: $2,004 - Coaching expenses.

## Budget Vs. Actuals

![|476x295](upload://6HYAVJEQ4xn1FJmiTpCVHgkTJoy.png "Chart")

In September, we noted an unspent amount of $52,711 from our budget, which is a positive sign of our financial health. This conservative approach helps ensure we can cover our monthly expenses.

**Breakdown by business unit / workstream:**

The restructuring of the **DAO** (formerly known as **Ecosystem Collective**) led to forming a small team focused on delivering results.
The expenses of this business unit totaled $40,448 in September, $19k above budget (the overspend is attributed to an unbudgeted HC position, as well as additional costs associated with processing this cost through Deel). See below the cost breakdown:
Headcount: $38,312
Software & Subscriptions: $2,136

![|596x369](upload://nygyLEkHZjn8dPZxurxNNBrkO7V.png "Chart")

* January and February represent MMM workstream performance.

**Grants Lab** business unit's expenses totaled $430,049 in September, $72k below budget (primarily due to 2 open positions and lower consultant and software expenses). See below the cost breakdown:
Headcount: $266,201
Other Consultants: $153,730
