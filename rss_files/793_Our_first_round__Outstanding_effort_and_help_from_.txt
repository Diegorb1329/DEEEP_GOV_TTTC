Our first round. Outstanding effort and help from LATAM
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/our-first-round-outstanding-effort-and-help-from-latam/17608
    **Two different opportunities**

TLDR; We launched a gitcoin round sponsored by Talent Protocol focused on Mexican startups.

**Introduction:**

Gitcoin funding rounds are now an experience that we have mastered in Mexico, however we have very few projects that are in it and we would love to be recognized as the first approach to build an ecosystem of Grants, with the funds raised in [Talent Protocol](https://beta.talentprotocol.com/home).

**Objectives and Scope:**

Talent Protocol is a tool for builders, entrepreneurs and thinkers in the ecosystem, which today has given the opportunity to hack, travel and also build robust applications and experiences within the countries where there have been hackathons organized by ETH global. I consider that this experience is every day more important and necessary to know and have the first crypto event, which sometimes can change your life. That is why the union thought with Gitcoin, which is a resilient team that has been in the ecosystem for many years, creating opportunities and funding projects.

Timeline and Planning:

Phase 1: First we designed and planned the round (Week 1) We used the Gitcoin Grant Stack: https://www.gitcoin.co/, this was the first approach that we had  from Talent Protocol. 

And then i published a little guideline to set and deploy the round. 

![](upload://774RTXdescj79Do3ONz0k980luq.jpeg)
1. First you have to set the Round, in which chain you are going to deploy. So, we will use Optimism, since it’s the best and most influential chain in which we have been working in Nación Bankless.

2. - The Grant has been deployed and signed:

![](upload://p5LbXz1gfitrqrCIos2cs1y5Fqa.jpeg)
3.- The Round started in 26th december through the 07 january of 2024. This round accepted applications between the 14th december to the 21th of december.

4.- The round used DAI, i've migrated TUSD from ethereum to Optimism, and then swapped it for DAI, the funds and make a top cap of 25% for one project. This round won’t have a minimum donation threshold and also we will need a Gitcoin Passport.

https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/10/0x6d28322989d76ccd181bcd767b15fda5bdb26bbf

**Phase 2:**

Reviewing applications (Week 2) This week we reviewed the applications and make sure that they comply with the necessary characteristics to be funded.

**Phase 3:**

Testing and Deployment (Week 3) Conduct marketing campaigns on Twitter, YouTube and within the Bankless Nation Telegram group to coordinate projects and evaluate whether it is possible to increase the funding round.

**Phase 4:**

The round starded on December 26 through 07th January, we had two weeks of donations to raise more funds for the community.

**I had a very great experience**

After an exciting couple of weeks. Since the start of the Talent Protocol voting, I have been building and creating more friendships among the talents that have been in the ecosystem.

**What i’ve done:**

1.- We took the Grant to initiate the promotion of this round with twitter spaces and community sharing:

After the end of the round i was very excited because the experience was marvelous, since the community helped to raise more funds than we expected.

In this link you can interact with the round to see the projects https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/

![](upload://kl5LvVvuMj0g8CprcXHfnxWTnYZ.jpeg)

- The round finalized in January 7th of 2024, after the reviewing process and then i've funded the contract with 1000 DAI to disburse the payment to the community and we need to be sure that they have all the rules on going and continuing working. This is the first Mexican Round and Talent Protocol gave the funds to this initiative, and I think that the next round is going to be huge and I can help Protocol to ask for more funds for more rounds.

https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x180b87bbb98a386118c38998c6f1ffd92e2553c1b280a3510281c1eb2163cb81

- Create more rounds for Talent Protocol, and use this experience to get funds to help more people and get funds.

**My Learnings**
All I can say is it was fantastic. How much? Unimaginable, so much that now I can't stop doing it, really helping the community through crowdfunding is fascinating, from this round came accommodation for hackathons, paying for venues for events, support for a podcast, support for a Mexican swap, even the possibility of doing collective art in Mexico City, plus it allowed me to meet wonderful people and lovely people. 

What was missing?
We can never make everyone happy, there were projects that did not sign the second transactions to be able to participate in the round and some that did not even know about it, but we believe that for the next rounds a good experience will follow so that this will not happen again and they will be ready for round 20.

And what's next?
Well now, we will have a round in which 11 communities have come together, which will run on Gitcoin with the [Arbitrum program](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-300k-arbitrum-matching-fest-for-running-rounds-on-arbitrum-one/16940). That's right, as you are reading this, expect our report soon and thank you for your time.
And we are very grateful for @ZER8 your time and patience. Now we just have to start enjoying the experiences that the community gives us day by day.

<p><strong>Learnings</strong>:<br>
Community just rocks, we had a very cool experience doing this matching and crowdfunding for several communities, now we are stronger and working together as a bigger entity that look for the benefit of public good and applications.<br>
<strong>Deliverables</strong><br>
-The vast majority of our grantees continue working in their apps, we are aware that the money that we reached isn’s enough to scale but was the first step to get into the process. Here are the links of the apps that are in development:<br>

5.- MesoReefDAO x NerdsLabs didn’t deliver any advance or update. <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/robioreefeco">@robioreefeco</a></p>
<p>For me and my team was an amazing experience but also with a bitter taste with one of the grantees that didn’t deliver what they promised. I hope that this information works for anyone interested in this applications that are also doing a great job and making waves in the GG21 stage.<br>
We are looking forward to make more rounds to help the people achieve their goals and continue growing within the community. Maybe or next rounds it’s going to be… Art? Public Goods? DeFi? ReFi? DeSci?, why? Because we are always imaging a better and more sustainable world, and the game changers live in ourselves.</p>

            <p>Sure I think that could be possible.</p>
<p>I know that <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/sejalrekhan">@sejalrekhan</a> and I are planning to do a revamp of the information here and update as right now it is more a MVP versus what we would consider a true “V1 Final”.  If okay with you maybe we put a pin in this for a few weeks to a month and I think over that time we will be able to get the portal to a place that is V1 and ready for translation.</p>
<p>Additionally we will need to ensure that we have a process around change management as we expect that we will continuously update this documentation over time.</p>
<p>Very much appreciate the interest and support!</p>

<li>The round finalized in January 7th of 2024, after the reviewing process and then i’ve funded the contract with 1000 DAI to disburse the payment to the community and we need to be sure that they have all the rules on going and continuing working. This is the first Mexican Round and Talent Protocol gave the funds to this initiative, and I think that the next round is going to be huge and I can help Protocol to ask for more funds for more rounds.</li>

<ul>
<li>Create more rounds for Talent Protocol, and use this experience to get funds to help more people and get funds.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Learnings</strong><br>
All I can say is it was fantastic. How much? Unimaginable, so much that now I can’t stop doing it, really helping the community through crowdfunding is fascinating, from this round came accommodation for hackathons, paying for venues for events, support for a podcast, support for a Mexican swap, even the possibility of doing collective art in Mexico City, plus it allowed me to meet wonderful people and lovely people.</p>
<p>What was missing?<br>
We can never make everyone happy, there were projects that did not sign the second transactions to be able to participate in the round and some that did not even know about it, but we believe that for the next rounds a good experience will follow so that this will not happen again and they will be ready for round 20.</p>
<p>And what’s next?<br>
Well now, we will have a round in which 11 communities have come together, which will run on Gitcoin with the <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-300k-arbitrum-matching-fest-for-running-rounds-on-arbitrum-one/16940">Arbitrum program</a>. That’s right, as you are reading this, expect our report soon and thank you for your time.<br>
And we are very grateful for <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/zer8">@ZER8</a> your time and patience. Now we just have to start enjoying the experiences that the community gives us day by day.</p>
