**Building context and scaling up processes with a new DAO workstream?**

* @CoachJonathan proposes a [DAO infrastructural mechanisms workstream](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-dao-infra-workstream/16732) with a lean team to assist with task execution (1 part-time Workstream Lead and a few part-time contributors) in order to maintain key processes for Gitcoin (that either don’t easily fall within the current workstream structure or can be done more effectively/efficiently within a single, focused workstream).

**Reducing friction on GCPs (Gitcoin Community Proposals) and DAO onboarding**

* The Allo workstream proposes [managing Season 20's GCPs on Allo v2](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/temp-check-managing-s20-gcps-on-allo-v2-repost/16726), aiming to streamline community involvement, seed ideas, and trial microgrants as an Allo use-case. This initiative presented by @nategosselin is budgeted at $75k, and it involves building an intuitive front-end app allowing GCP submissions, approvals by designated stewards, and transparent status tracking.

**Quadratic Avengers Training Pilot Cohort**

* @sejalrekhan from Green Pill Network announced the new [Gitcoin's Round Manager Training Pilot Cohort](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/announcing-the-launch-of-round-managers-training-pilot-cohort/16724) to bootstrap Gitcoin Grants adoption and impact by training external entities. Participants will not only gain skills to manage rounds, become[ Quadratic Avengers](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-the-quadratic-avengers/16684), and receive a POAP or other NFT to commemorate the experience, but they also may become service providers. This emphasis on education promises a more inclusive, knowledgeable future for Gitcoin and the wider Web3 community.

**Get ready for S20 & Beyond…**

S20 is all about a more nuanced direction as outlined in the comprehensive [Governance Roadmap ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/governance-roadmap-s19-20-beyond/16645)proposed by @deltajuliet and @CoachJonathan. Gitcoin plans to enhance transparency and accountability by emphasizing community-led decision-making, through new governance initiatives such as:

* Updated [documentation repository](https://gitcoin-1.gitbook.io/gitcoin-governance-manual/) for all things governance.
* Comms cadence ossified and increased.
* Roll out PIP (Passport) and AIP (Allo) initiative.
* Roll out expanded Gitcoin Grants governance initiative.
* Rollout of Passport gated governance forum (and solutions to include those who cannot afford to own GTC).
* Explorations of election-based roles at Gitcoin.
* Research DAO2DAO governance opportunities.
* Monthly Steward onboarding calls.

**We can fund public goods regardless of whether the red team or the blue team is in power.**

* Credible neutrality is pivotal in public goods funding amid diverse community values. Gitcoin Grants embraced this diversity by becoming a DAO, allowing the community to shape itself and the protocols being developed. Controversies arise due to varied beliefs, but Gitcoin's approach enables forking programs, ensuring inclusivity, product emergence, protocol amalgamation, and genuine decentralization. Dive deeper with @owocki ‘s insights on [credible neutrality within the memetic tribes of our polarized world](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/credible-neutrality-in-the-gitcoin-ecosystem/16743).

**Governing Allo v2**

* The second version of Allo will be going live on main net soon. When it does, the Gitcoin community will have a new set of responsibilities: governing a protocol. This has been a long time in the making and @0xZakk is excited to share what this means for our community, check out his latest [Overview of new governance responsibilities and opportunities for GTC holders.](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/governing-allo-v2-overview-of-new-governance-responsibilities-and-opportunities-for-gtc-holders/16591)

## What’s new?

*Gitcoin is [redefining its guiding principles](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-community-feedback-on-gitcoin-s-essential-intents-for-2023-2024/16657) to navigate the complexities of decentralized governance and product development. These Essential Intents (EIs) work synergistically, creating a virtuous cycle. Gitcoin aims for short-term stabilized operations and long-term decentralization, striving to become a model for DAO sustainability and excellence by focusing on 3 interconnected pillars:*

1. **Network Effects** – Maximizing ecosystem growth through product adoption. The focus is on community initiatives, partnerships, and cross-workstream collaborations.

2. **Community First** – Cultivating a thriving community internally and externally, emphasizing active participation, effective governance, and Gitcoin's platform adoption. Programs like Gitcoin Grants, community events, and educational content are central.

3. **Financial Longevity** – Ensuring Gitcoin's economic health and longevity through efficient budget allocation, ROI-driven investments, and transparent financial reporting. This pillar supports sustained growth and innovation.

# 🎯 **Goals**

* **Allo + Grants Stack** – Drive $1M in total individual contributions, with at least 50% of matching pool funds coming from new donations.

* **Passport** – Strive for 75%+ of Donors to authenticate their identity using Passport, with a score of 20+.

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Financial Longevity</strong> – Ensuring Gitcoin’s economic health and longevity through efficient budget allocation, ROI-driven investments, and transparent financial reporting. This pillar supports sustained growth and innovation.</p>
