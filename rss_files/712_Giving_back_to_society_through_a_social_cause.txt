Giving back to society through a social cause
wizardjuan

            <p>Hello - I‚Äôm new to the community here and grateful to be here. I‚Äôm very excited to participate in discussions around the civic application of DLT both technologically and how it can incentivize behavior socially.</p>
<p>The New Inquiry used to run a project called Bail Bloc - a browser based monero miner that anyone could run - and used the proceeds to bail folks out of jail in the US. A very practical application. We could revive this project or appropriate it for other social causes.</p>

            <p>povery and hunger are consequence of financial / monetary system. IMHO first goal is to remove central banks and financial institutions power. Everything else follows</p>

            <p>A process that scales better may be to help each country/region/interest group to set up and run their own education and voting systems - I‚Äôd be keen to help setup and develop such a framework - to help localized communities understand quadratic voting, how onboarding can work and how it may apply to their area, case studies on how Gitcoin grants has been working, basics on digital currencies etc.</p>
<p>Then the community by all means can vote to allocate seed monies to establish a local group based on this template and/or help them with the technical means to get established‚Ä¶I think this could be a LOT more scalable and reduce the amount of voting required to allocate funds.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm Fairly new here - if someone who knows the ropes would like to help me think this through in more detail and give me pointers on how to write up a proposal let me know‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been wanting to do something like this for a while</p>

            <p>‚ÄòLow‚Äô is relative in all these regards. Low is better than none and of course the more sophisticated the education, the higher the bounties and income can be as the students will by then have skills they can deploy.</p>

            <p>Good point <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/haywyer">@haywyer</a> there would need to be some kind of balancing system. I guess to start with (speaking very broadly) could we assume that the bounty value would correlate with the regional education levels? I.e. areas with poor education = lower income = lower bounties are still attractive?</p>

            <p>I think it depends on the education level required to compete for the bounty as compared to the level of education in the region (as well as technology/web availability). If the bounty itself incentivizes education that can provide access to further bounties that‚Äôs ideal. Maybe whole courses should be set up this way.</p>

            <p>I definitely think the community should have a big focus on social and environmental causes. Perhaps some funding can go to traditional organizations/projects, and I also really like the idea of supporting the development of and education in regards to smart contract/blockchain technologies and the positive change they can create. For example, smart contract crop insurance can more cheaply protect farmers in the case of extreme weather. Also, smart contracts could provide financial incentives for individuals or groups to protect a forest like in the recent initiative by Chainlink.</p>
