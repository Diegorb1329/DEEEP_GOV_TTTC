[Proposal] Ratify the Results of Grants Round 14 and Formally Request the Community Multisig Holders to Payout Matching Allocations
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-ratify-the-results-of-grants-round-14-and-formally-request-the-community-multisig-holders-to-payout-matching-allocations/11038
    We ask our Community Stewards to ratify the GR14 payout amounts as being correct, fair, and abiding to community norms, including the judgments and sanctions made by the Fraud Detection & Defense workstream.

The full list of final results & payout amounts can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dS7RI3LnkJHbYCZC3upFk8FxuJb7CKb8dHAPsLx-dn4/edit?usp=sharing).

We would like to suggest voting on Snapshot to begin on Tuesday, July 5th in advance of payouts being made on Friday, July 15th.

# Options to vote on:

1. Ratify the round results

You ratify the results as reported by the Public Goods Funding & Fraud Detection & Defense workstreams and request the keyholders of the community multisig to payout funds according to the GR14 final payout amounts through the non-custodial GR14 deployment contract.

2. Request further deliberation

You do not ratify the results and request key holders of the community multi-sig wallet to delay payment until further notice.

## TLDR from the [GR14 Post](https://gitcoin.co/blog/gr14-results/):

* Grants Round 14 (GR14) ran from June 8-23, 2022

* $4.9M will be distributed to public goods as part of the round, of which $3.2M came from the combined matching pools and $1.7M was contributed by the community.

* Record-breaking community participation with over 44,000 contributors making just shy of 600,000 contributions to over 1,250 grants

* GR14 featured 18 rounds:
  * The main round

  * 14 Ecosystem rounds: Aurora, Celo, ENS, EthInfra, Lootverse, Mask, OpenGaming, Polygon, ProtocolLabs, Radicle, TheGraph, Unlock, ZKTech, Oakland

  * Three cause rounds: Climate Solutions, Advocacy and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)

* In GR14, we continued on the same main pool structure as GR12 and GR13 â€“ in GR12, the community chose to pilot a single pool approach with a 2.5% maximum cap for the main round rather than a category-based setup and we continued this through GR13 and GR14. 


FDDâ€™s Governance Brief for an overview of sybil detection will be out soon, stay tuned.

    The Fraud Detection &amp; Defense workstream (FDD) aims to minimize the impact of fraud on our community. In this post, we highlight the quantitative data behind GR14 and the qualitative decisions made. We also describe the reasoning behind any subjective judgments along with making recommendations to the Grants Operations team and Stewards for new policy revisions to match changing circumstances.
