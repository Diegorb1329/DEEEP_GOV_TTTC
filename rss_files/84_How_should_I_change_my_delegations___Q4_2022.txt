How should I change my delegations? [Q4 2022]
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-should-i-change-my-delegations-q4-2022/11542
    can't believe its "that time" again!  i think i saw somewhere that budgeting for S16 starts in early October, so i'm starting a thread to discuss my Q4 2022 delegations in advance of that.

medium/long term, i'd love to decentralize my GTC voting power among more community members.  [here is my post on that.](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-should-i-change-my-delegations-q3-2022/11132/5).

short term, 
1. because of [my disaffiliation](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/passing-the-torch/10971/2) i am not aware of what up & coming talent there is in the DAO.  thus far i've not been getting a ton of inbound on [this form](https://forms.gle/6dkw2P9ybvvepznA6) so my plan to decentralize my delegations is somewhat stalled.
1. because of (1), i plan to mostly keep my [Q3 2022](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-should-i-change-my-delegations-q3-2022/11132) delegations in tact, but may make small changes to tweak here & there.  
2. id love to learn more about the up & coming talent in the DAO. please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/6dkw2P9ybvvepznA6) if you have a recommendation to make.
2. i'll also likely delegate more to @J9leger from @annika because Annika is out for a few months.  I plan to reverse that change when Annika returns.

# feedback welcome

i would like to solicit feedback from you all about how i should change my delegations for S16/S17.  

pls come to [my office hours](bit.ly/owockiOH) or fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/6dkw2P9ybvvepznA6) if you have feedback for me (anon responses ok).  or if you can comment below as long as your comment meets the [forum guidelines and code of conduct](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/forum-guidelines-and-code-of-conduct/758/163).

<p>a few notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>the transfer to <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/j9leger">@J9leger</a> is temporary while <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/annika">@annika</a> is out; ill likely revert it back when annika returns.</li>
<li>i remain interested in decentralizing my delegations further.  you can start to see that in the reductions to kyle/kris + the increases to nate/chase/azeem/ben‚Ä¶ but i need more recommendations to be able to fully decentralize my <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-should-i-change-my-delegations-q3-2022/11132/5">delegation decentralization goal</a>
</li>
<li>please fill out <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-should-i-change-my-delegations-q3-2022/11132/5">this form</a> if you have suggestions for whom i should delegate to!</li>
<li>im v excited for grants 2 + gitcoin passport.  woooo decentralization + modularlity!</li>
