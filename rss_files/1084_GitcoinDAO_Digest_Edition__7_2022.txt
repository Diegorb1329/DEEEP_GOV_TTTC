## [üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Workstream Discussion](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/workstream-discussion/9)

* Tracking for Grants and Bounties have been set up to identify overlap between the two products.

### üíô [Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Fraud-Detection-Defense-2bde13c0b8e74fda81435d94e49e2703)

* This week began a series of workshops to teach 3 DAO contributors to run the Anti-Sybil Operational Process so the DAO can take over work previously done by Blockscience.

* An app was built for human evaluations of Sybil accounts allowing us to better protect the process from vulnerabilities and allow us to improve on inter-reviewer reliability.

* The Grant Review Team is going to the backup plan of scaling grants reviews as the Gitcoin Holdings team needs more time to assess legal implications of integrating data to our GIA software built for this purpose.

* Gitcoin GR13 is just around the corner, a new Grants Verification Score has been implemented to help eliminate bad actors and ensure that funding is more proportionately matched to trusted contributors. Learn more in our [blog post](https://gitcoin.co/blog/trust-bonus).
