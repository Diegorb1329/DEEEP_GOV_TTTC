Knowledge Transfer: Gitcoin Grants Wall of Love
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/knowledge-transfer-gitcoin-grants-wall-of-love/11569
    At Messari Mainnet this year, a Gitcoin contributor recently asked me where the "wall of love" for grants went, and asked if there was any plans to bring it back.  So I am typing this post up to answer as much of that question as I can publicly.

# What was the Wall of Love?

## Input

Back in Gitcoin Grants 4-6, there used to be a "comment" feature on the grants checkout page, wherein in addition to leaving some funds for each grant, you could leave a comment of encouragement for the grant owner.

For Grants round 5-6, there was the ability to prefill these comments with basic messages like
- "üí™ keep up the great work"
- "üòç love the mission of your project"
- "üôå Great Job"
- "üëç i appreciate you"
- Custom messages you input.

I can't find a screenshot of this UI anywhere, so youll all have to just imagine what it looked like.

## Output

The results of such input from contributor were then displayed on the grant's "wall", right above the newsfeed.  Here are a few sample "Wall of Love"s

# Summary

As you can see above, the wall of love was a feature [that allowed](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1516734601334607874) "social capital" to flow alongside the "financial capital" in Gitcoin Grants.

Users were prompted to input a message for each grant owner upon checkout, which was used to generate a wall of love on each grant. 

Most wall of love comments were short prefilled comments, but there was a long tail of comments that were custom and sometimes a bit more thoughtful.

If anyone contributing to GitcoinDAO, who has metabase access, wants to see the wall of love for a grant, they can do so [here](https://metabase.gitcoin.co/question/1244?grant_id=416).

The wall of love was deprecated due to the churn and turmoil of the [Great Bear and Great Reset of 2020](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-great-bear-the-great-reset-the-great-revival/9855).

Most of the DAO contributors involved in Gitcoin today were not around for the Wall of Love. This post is pureful for informational purposes and knowledge transfer purposes.

            <p>Great way to encourage more interaction between grantees and donors. Creating meaningful connections between every level of participation is something we should constantly improve.</p>
