I just released a post on twitter entitled [Transcending the  Individualism & Collectivist Divide](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1458541350211575808) making the case that there is a large opportunity to create alignment between these Individualist/Collectivist communities with web3 (and thereby move past the differences with views on public goods funding).

TLDR of the talk

1. Individualists/Collectivists do not agree how to organize society.
2. These disagreements were amplified by the nation-state era.
3. We can bridge this divide with web3.
