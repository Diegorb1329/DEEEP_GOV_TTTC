https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/citizens-forward-llm-rfp-pathway-2-open-innovation/17980
    tl;dr: This RFP is shared as part of the recently launched [Citizens Forward](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gitcoin-s-citizen-grants-program/17470#citizens-forward-26) program. The program seeks to involve the Gitcoin community in assisting with pre-defined projects through Request for Proposals (RFPs). You can find more information about the program on the portal [here](https://gitcoin.notion.site/52bb700932924eeb9c2fef9f04951a68?pvs=25). If you‚Äôre interested in applying, you may submit your application on Grants Stack before the submission deadline (see section 5 for details).

## 1. RFP Objective:

We aim to develop a system that not only simplifies the discovery of public goods but also personalizes the experience for users, fostering greater engagement, transparency, and accessibility. This initiative is central to our mission, embodying our dedication to supporting public goods through innovative technological integration.

This objective is divided into two separate RFPs. Pathway 2, this post, focuses on open innovation and creative uses of LLMs. To submit applications for Pathway 1 focusing on specific LLM-enabled features for grant discovery, click [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/citizens-forward-llm-rfp-pathway-1-specific-deliverable/17979).

## 2. Pathway 2: Open Innovation

In recognizing the vast potential of LLM technology, we invite proposals under our Open Innovation pathway. This segment of the RFP is dedicated to groundbreaking ideas that push the boundaries of what's possible in grants discovery and management. We are looking for unique, creative uses of LLMs that can offer fresh perspectives and solutions to existing challenges, enhancing the accessibility, efficiency, and impact of discovering public goods.

### Vision for Innovation

            <p>Looks great! A new standalone post on this might get the topic in front of the right audience.

            <p>Yes of course!</p>
<p>My thinking is that a Passport CLI would give users and devs direct access to core functionalities of Passport without having to write their own scripts or apps to interact with the API.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the benefits of a Passport CLI would be:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>An enhanced dev experience:</strong> would allow devs to quickly test and interact with Passport without the overhead of writing their own code. Speeds up development cycles and prototyping. Access to core functionalities via the CLI would also lower the barrier to entry for devs new to the Passport ecosystem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automation and integration:</strong> the CLI can be integrated into scripts, CI/CD pipelines and other automation tools, providing devs a standardized way to automate interactions with Passport.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accessibility and inclusivity:</strong> CLI tools can be more accessible to users with visual impairments, as they can be used with screen readers more effectively than webapps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Differentiates the Passport ecosystem:</strong> having a suite of command-line tools can differentiate the Passport ecosystem from competitors, making it more attractive to devs and users seeking user- and dev-friendly platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Potential to reduce support queries:</strong> A CLI can help reduce support queries related to using the API by providing standardized ways to perform common tasks, which would lower support hours and costs currently provided by the Passport team and open source contributors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, I see the CLI as a valuable tool to extend Gitcoin Passport‚Äôs capabilities, in ways that are aligned with developers‚Äô workflows and needs.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm pulling a bit from <a href="https://passportxyz.notion.site/Gitcoin-Passport-Citizens-Round-3-dac1312b53034fbebfe32ef353321275" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this page on the Passport Notion site for Citizens Round #3</a>, which lists some suggested projects by the Gitcoin Passport team that would qualify a Citizen for retro funding.</p>
<p>As for me, I‚Äôm a dev with ~2 years experience who has mostly worked with React, Typescript, and Node. I‚Äôve been following Passport with interest since 2022, when I worked in the MMM workstream as the Gitcoin Digest newsletter editor and as a content writer.</p>
<p>I would love to build something that is useful to devs and users in the ecosystem <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
