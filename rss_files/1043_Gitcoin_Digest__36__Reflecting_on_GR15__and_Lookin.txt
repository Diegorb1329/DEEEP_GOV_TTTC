## Reflecting on GR15, and Beginning Strategic Planning for S16

This week, GitcoinDAO workstreams analyzed and contemplated the results and impact of Grants Round 15. Workstreams worked internally to assess their performance during GR15, and together, to think about where Gitcoin Grants is headed, and how best to get there.

**High-level, here’s what’s happening in the DAO this week:**

* **We are in the process of having DAO stewards ratify the matching allocations for GR15.** The next step is a Snapshot vote. [Read the proposal here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-ratify-the-results-of-grants-round-15-and-formally-request-the-community-multisig-holders-to-payout-matching-allocations/11593).

* **Moonshot Collective has [proposed to merge](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-ratify-the-results-of-grants-round-15-and-formally-request-the-community-multisig-holders-to-payout-matching-allocations/11593) with the Gitcoin Product Collective workstream(GPC),** to increase capacity and align all Gitcoin product work under one workstream.
* **We just launched our inaugural Open Data Science Hackathon.** It runs from 10/3 - 10/31. You still have time to apply! [Learn more here](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/datascience/?). You can also listen to [the ODS Hackathon Q&A Twitter Space](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1MnxnpqXqdYGO) hosted by [Lani](https://twitter.com/lanitrock), from earlier today.

**Also , [ETH Bogotá](https://bogota.ethglobal.com/), [Dev Con Bogota](https://devcon.org/), and [Schelling Point](https://schellingpoint.gitcoin.co/) are fast approaching.** ETH Bogota runs from 10/7 - 10/9, Dev Con runs from 10/11 - 10/14, and Schelling Point runs all day on 10/10.

## ☑️ From the Governance Forum

* **[“[Proposal] Ratify the Results of Grants Round 15…”, by Janine
](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-ratify-the-results-of-grants-round-15-and-formally-request-the-community-multisig-holders-to-payout-matching-allocations/11593)**
Janine posted this proposal in the forum requesting that community Stewards ratify the payout matching allocations, and greenlight the payment of grant funds to grantees. There are two options to vote on for the proposal: 1) “Ratify the round results”, and 2) Request further deliberation. From Janine: “We would like to suggest voting on Snapshot to begin on Wednesday, October 5th in advance of payouts being made on Friday, October 14th.”

  **Request for Comment:** If you are a Steward, [please have a look at this post](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-ratify-the-results-of-grants-round-15-and-formally-request-the-community-multisig-holders-to-payout-matching-allocations/11593), and leave comments and questions. Stay tuned for the Snapshot vote!

* “[**The Future of Moonshot Collective”, by michaelgreen06**
](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-future-of-moonshot-collective/11604)
With the consent of the Gitcoin Product Collective(GPC) workstream, the Moonshot Collective(MC) workstream has decided to merge with the GPC workstream. michaelgreen06 reviews MC’s origins, and the reasons it was founded, and why MC has chosen to merge with GPC. The tl;dr is that MC was formed during a bull cycle, and, per michaelgreen06, “when the bear market hit we…had to shift our focus to advancing the DAO’s essential intents”. As part of GPC, MC will increase GPC’s ability to improve and ship Gitcoin protocols such as Gitcoin Passport, Round Manager, and Grants Hub.

  **Request for Comment:** michaelgreen06 has requested feedback on MC’s proposal to merge with GPC. [Reply to the post here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-future-of-moonshot-collective/11604#what-do-you-think-9).

* [**“GR15 Fraud Analysis”, by Disruption Joe**
](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gr15-fraud-analysis/11609)
From Joe: “[This post] highlight[s] the quantitative data behind GR15 and the qualitative decisions made”. This post gives the fraud-tracking statistics for each round in GR15. It also explains FDD’s rationale for subjective decisions that have been made in addressing potential fraud that occurred during GR15.

* [**“Linking discourse handle to your ETH address”, by mmurthy**
](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/linking-discourse-handle-to-your-eth-address/10557/6)
[mmurthy](https://twitter.com/mvmurthy/status/1466083781618581504), founder of the DAO metrics dApp, [Karma](https://www.showkarma.xyz/dao/delegates/ens), posted in the governance forum to let Stewards know that they can connect their Discourse/governance forum handle to their ETH address. Doing this will show the Steward’s governance forum activity on [daostewards.xyz](https://www.daostewards.xyz/).

  If you’re a Gitcoin Steward and this appeals to you, you can [post your ETH address in the post replies here](https://www.daostewards.xyz/).

The Open Data Science Hackathon is an open data science hackathon to support public goods, led by GitcoinDAO’s FDD workstream. The hackathon aims to nurture an open data science community to play a crucial role in defending and growing web3 and open approaches to innovation. The ODS Hackathon has roots in the Sybil defense research that the FDD workstream has been doing over multiple grants rounds. FDD seeks to create a community to decentralize the Sybil defense work they’ve been doing with fellow Sybil Slayers, Human Hackers, and Dune Detectives.

   The hackathon started yesterday, 10/3, and runs until 10/31. There’s still time to join! [Learn more here.](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/datascience/onboard)

</a></strong><br>
Janine posted this proposal in the forum requesting that community Stewards ratify the payout matching allocations, and greenlight the payment of grant funds to grantees. There are two options to vote on for the proposal: 1) “Ratify the round results”, and 2) Request further deliberation. From Janine: “We would like to suggest voting on Snapshot to begin on Wednesday, October 5th in advance of payouts being made on Friday, October 14th.”</p>
<p><strong>Request for Comment:</strong> If you are a Steward, <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-ratify-the-results-of-grants-round-15-and-formally-request-the-community-multisig-holders-to-payout-matching-allocations/11593">please have a look at this post</a>, and leave comments and questions.

<p>“<a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-future-of-moonshot-collective/11604"><strong>The Future of Moonshot Collective”, by michaelgreen06</strong><br>
</a><br>
With the consent of the Gitcoin Product Collective(GPC) workstream, the Moonshot Collective(MC) workstream has decided to merge with the GPC workstream. michaelgreen06 reviews MC’s origins, and the reasons it was founded, and why MC has chosen to merge with GPC. The tl;dr is that MC was formed during a bull cycle, and, per michaelgreen06, “when the bear market hit we…had to shift our focus to advancing the DAO’s essential intents”. As part of GPC, MC will increase GPC’s ability to improve and ship Gitcoin protocols such as Gitcoin Passport, Round Manager, and Grants Hub.</p>
<p><strong>Request for Comment:</strong> michaelgreen06 has requested feedback on MC’s proposal to merge with GPC. <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-future-of-moonshot-collective/11604#what-do-you-think-9">Reply to the post here</a>.</p>

</a><br>
The Open Data Science Hackathon is an open data science hackathon to support public goods, led by GitcoinDAO’s FDD workstream. The hackathon aims to nurture an open data science community to play a crucial role in defending and growing web3 and open approaches to innovation. The ODS Hackathon has roots in the Sybil defense research that the FDD workstream has been doing over multiple grants rounds. FDD seeks to create a community to decentralize the Sybil defense work they’ve been doing with fellow Sybil Slayers, Human Hackers, and Dune Detectives.</p>
<p>The hackathon started yesterday, 10/3, and runs until 10/31. There’s still time to join! <a href="https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/datascience/onboard" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Learn more here.</a></p>
