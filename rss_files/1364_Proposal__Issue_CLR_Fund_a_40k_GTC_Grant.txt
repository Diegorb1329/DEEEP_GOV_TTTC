https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-issue-clr-fund-a-40k-gtc-grant/8240
    # Summary

![image968|690x200](upload://ff4iGjXIBygmR6LBz7VFBbWzZ8r.png)


This proposal, if passed, would issue a grant of 40k GTC (0.008% of the GTC treasury) to CLR.Fund, a project with a similar mission as Gitcoin (fund public goods) but with a complementary product.

Disclaimer: This proposal was co-authored/reviewed by @austingriffith , @auryn, @owocki and myself.

# Abstract

CLR.Fund is another prominent Quadratic Funding project in the Ethereum ecosystem with a mission/ethos that is similar to Gitcoin. This proposal issues them a grant, which solves for the near term the funding of CLR.Fund.

Secondarily, this proposal if passed would

1. Extend [previous friendly contact between Kevin Owocki and Auryn MacMillian](https://twitter.com/nanexcool/status/1383481998417678342) to formally affirm that Gitcoin & CLRFund are friendly projects built around similar missions.
2. Change the narrative created by other competitive projects working on the same domain. That is the misguided belief that we must have sharp elbows - boxing each other out from each other‚Äôs users and demonstrate loud social media clap-backs.
3. It is possible that the goodwill between the two projects could be extended into a formal integration or partnership one day - especially with the [Decentralize Gitcoin workstream](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-suggestion-decentralize-gitcoin/180) gaining speed.
4. By pushing new tech and solutions on top of QF (such as MACI), CLR.Fund can act as a testbed/testnet for future gitcoin features and visa-versa.

# Motivation

Gitcoin‚Äôs mission is to build & fund the open web. Gitcoin has done that in a few ways, Ethical Ads, Hackathons, Grants, and KERNEL.

Gitcoin Grants is a [prominent pillar](https://gitcoin.co/results) of the Gitcoin ecosystem, and momentum from Gitcoin Grants has been extended to many similar QF projects - recently [Downtown Stimulus](http://twitter.com/dtstimulus) and [FundOSS](http://twitter.com/_fundoss) were driven by the Gitcoin team. Outside of the Gitcoin team, CLRfund, RXC Voice, and Build Guild have been shipped by other teams in the ecosystem.

Similarly to CLR.Fund, Gitcoin Grants is reliant on [Quadratic Funding](https://wtfisqf.com/). A mechanism for ‚Äúthe mathemtically optimal democratic funding of public goods.‚Äù Although QF is very powerful, there are a number of problems with QF - scaling it involves solving thorny governance problems - Sybil resistance and collusion resistance are prominent examples. The exploration of this design space is a public good to all QF projects - insofar as the learnings advance all QF projects towards their missions.

For this reason - It is our assertion that CLR.Fund‚Äôs implementation of Quadratic Funding is complementary to Gitcoin. Most notably, in the following ways.

* It is pushing forward MACI.
* It is pushing forward sybil resistance & collusion resistance.
* It is funding public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem.
* It is iterative and increasingly effectively proven itself, having run [7 rounds so far](https://blog.clr.fund/).
* Gitcoin Grants has [funded CLR.Fund](https://gitcoin.co/grants/524/clrfund) $33k in the past.
* The CLR.Fund has taken UI/design inspiration from Gitcoin Grants, and extended them to their decentralized QF protocol.
* Given that Gitcoin‚Äôs existing Grants product is centralized, and work to decentralize is ongoing, a partnership with CLRFund could be a fruitful way to accelerate the decentralization of Gitcoin Grants - and also to make Quadratic Funding in the Ethereum ecosystem more anti-fragile (similar to how there are many client implementations of ETH2).

# Specification

This proposal if passed would transfer 40k GTC to `0xadca3cF41e2e2517F1862b3CA18E8beF561EEded` - the address specified in the [CLR Fund Governance Doc](https://github.com/clrfund/governance) as the contributor funds address.

This grant is a no strings attached gesture to the CLR.Fund team. It is possible the two projects may formally work together in the future, but not a requirement for the dispersal of funds.

# Benefits

See ‚ÄúMotivation‚Äù section above.

# Drawbacks

40k GTC would be removed from the treasury.

            <p>Hi Auryn. Firstly, I want to reiterate that my expectations here are for ALL proposals to gitcoin, not just yours. It‚Äôs about setting standards for the future.</p>
<p>The information you have provided in a few different comments is helpful, however, I don‚Äôt think anyone should have to go digging through the comments to get the details of what money is going to be spent on. I would like to see this information up front in the original proposal.</p>
<p>I would also expect it to be presented in a way that makes a clear link from the funding to the inputs to the outcomes. So your goal is to produce XYZ product, that will take XY hours of time from XYZ type of staff @ $XY rate + $$ other costs, therefor out financial needs are $$$. As opposed to, $40K sounds good, here‚Äôs roughly what we can do with it.</p>

            <p>I want to voice some concerns about the proposal. I like CLR and would like to see them funded. However $40K is a lot of money to be giving away without any type of concrete budget for past/future expenses and deliverables. I would like to set a standard for the content of proposals so as stewards, we can be better informed in making decisions about who and what to fund. I don‚Äôt think this proposal meets that standard and so I wil be voting no. If the proposers can put together a more detailed breakdown of why the request is for $40K in particular, I would be happy to support.</p>

            <p>Hey folks - just giving my 2 gwei that I‚Äôll be supporting this proposal.</p>
<p>Over the past ~6 months I‚Äôve been leading a team part-time that is building on the work of the clr.fund with the end goal of running a funding round for Eth2 public goods. You can find our work on GitHub at ethereum/clrfund, which we plan to merge back into the clr.fund monorepo to benefit all future clr.fund instances. We‚Äôve been working closely with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/auryn">@auryn</a> &amp; the clr.fund team throughout. I‚Äôve been impressed with the quality of their team members &amp; their passion for their mission. I‚Äôm confident they‚Äôll make great use of these funds to continue to push this space forward.</p>

            <p>I love this idea, specifically the thought that collaboration and the sharing of ideas can flow between teams. CLR.fund is further ahead in MACI and thinking through nested matching pools while Gitcoin is further ahead in scale.</p>
<p>Could we set the expectation that each team connect every two weeks to share current work and brainstorm on learnings and roadmaps a bit? The DOT and KSM analogy sounds wonderful given how tightly those groups collaborate.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/auryn">@auryn</a> - Would you be open to a sync every two weeks (or whoever is doing the building) to ensure both teams can learn from experiences of the others? When Gitcoin launches the dGrants protocol, the learning will be invaluable from the CLR.fund side to make sure we are offering complimentary experiences.</p>

<p>My understanding of this proposal is that it is less about specific future deliverables and more an acknowledgement of past work pushing the Quadratic Funding and Ethereum Public goods space forward.

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Hi. I am overall supportive of the effort clr.fund is doing but I do wonder why we need a separate proposal to acknowledge the past effort. The normal Gitcoin round should fulfil that purpose.</p>
<p>If we pass a proposal without set goals, targets, and deliverables, it may be very difficult to assess the effectiveness of the value delivered. I do suggest changing the format to the ‚ÄúBudget proposal‚Äù type.</p>

<p>Yeah, I have no qualms with this at all. Perhaps some vesting schedule with a clawback option for the Gitcoin DAO would be a good way to put people‚Äôs mind at ease. Above I mentioned that, at the current value, this could cover one year of costs for two devs and a PM, plus some misc. expenses. So perhaps vesting it continuously over the course of a year, or in four discrete tranches, would make sense.</p>
<p>As much as I‚Äôm confident that we could be trusted to do it on a handshake, we have a variety of great tools available to us to eliminate the need for trust, so we may as well make use of them.</p>

            <p>Retroactive funding for the win. I would absolutely support this proposal.</p>
<p>CLR.fund has made huge contributions to the QF space and supporting basically the only ‚Äúcompetitor‚Äù is exactly the right vibe.</p>
<p>We are all allies in the public goods space.</p>
<p>I will vote for this without any reservations.</p>
<p>That said, I think it would be in the best interest of GTC to see some vesting requirements in basically all of these large grants‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think they have to be even on chain‚Ä¶ just a friendly understanding that the holdings would only be liquidated at a certain rate‚Ä¶ And definitely would not be ‚Äúdiversified‚Äù upon receipt.</p>
<p>Honestly, with this team I don‚Äôt even think it would need to be said, they are crypto savvy, understand token economics, and have a culture of making win-win deals‚Ä¶ I assume they will hodl the GTC unless they need it. That said‚Ä¶ it would prob be cool to be explicit about that in all big grants that don‚Äôt have any milestones.</p>

            <p>In more concrete terms, at the current GTC value, this would give us the capacity to hire ~2 full-time developers and a full-time product manager for the next year, which would radically increase the rate that we can ship the features mentioned above. The other place that some small portion of the funding may be used is to cover infrastructure costs for running the coordinator, since computing the ZKPs can be pretty demanding.</p>
<p>There is some variability to how far this funding will get us, since we would obviously not intend to cash it out immediately.  Ideal case, we could find folks who want to be paid in GTC so there is no need to convert it at all. Otherwise, we would need to convert some portion of periodically (say monthly or quarterly) to cover dev costs.</p>

<p>For (1) I think it‚Äôs a good question. Auryn went into a bit more detail in his response but perhaps a more official breakdown of costs and a timeline could help alleviate some of the people‚Äôs concerns here as the amount is indeed rather big.</p>

            <p>2 questions arise in my mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>how the funds would be spent?</li>
<li>how this investment would benefit the Gitcoin community?</li>
</ol>

            <p>Good question, I also wonder if something like stream or vesting/time lock would make such grants more flexible?</p>

            <p>Clr.Fund , desde sus inicios a estado ayudando a proyectos con muy poco volumen 500 usd 100 usd sucede que en algunos paises es mas importante comer que tener financiamiento.</p>
<p>Sin duda apoyaria esta alternativa demostrando que realiza un trabajo etico para la comunidad , si la comunidad se guia por lo que ve y no le gusta la financiacion bajen los fondos a 35K pero sin duda son grupos que no hay que dejarlos solos por un click de distancia.</p>

            <p>Hi Simona! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wave.png?v=10" title=":wave:" class="emoji" alt=":wave:"></p>
<p>Yeah, this is a really valid question.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll start by acknowledging my obvious bias in this vote. Given that bias, I‚Äôll abstain from casting a vote. Anyone that wants to vote on this and has delegated to me should delegate to someone else for this proposal.</p>
<p>My understanding of this proposal is that it is less about specific future deliverables and more an acknowledgement of past work pushing the Quadratic Funding and Ethereum Public goods space forward. So I‚Äôd be inclined to view it in the same spirit of the <a href="https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Retroactive Public Goods funding post</a> that Optimism recently published. In other words, this would be the Gitcoin DAO explicitly saying <em>‚Äúwe value the contributions you have made to the QF space and want to align our future efforts towards funding Ethereum‚Äôs public goods‚Äù</em>.</p>
<p>That said, I do think there are specific deliverables that we are already planned and would be beneficial to the Gitcoin DAO, that could be much more easily achieved given this extra funding.<br>
Specifically, we are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Building a production ready decentralized QF protocol, with baked in Sybil and collusion resistance, that can scale to billions of users.</li>
<li>Making it easy for anyone to deploy their own instance of the clrfund to fund whatever public goods they want, including both the contracts and the app.</li>
<li>Building in a modular and extensible way so that instances of clrfund can choose the governance, Sybil resistance, and recipient registry solutions that best suit their community and use-case.</li>
</ol>
<p>This funding would allow some of our contributors to focus on this full-time, along with bringing new talent in (likely from the Gitcoin community via bounties).</p>
<p>One important thing for the Gitcoin DAO to consider is if/how this fits with the <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/decentralize-gitcoin-workstream-budget-request/8121">decentralize grants</a> workstream.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt think this will bring any help to the community. No matter what cooperation you say in the future, there is no promise. The funds of the treasury cannot be misused in this way. Unless CLR makes a commitment in specific cooperation and giving back to the community</p>

            <p>Agreed. I think that the things that were discussed in Twitter as per my post above can and should be formulated more formally in a post in this topic.</p>

            <p>I‚Äôd definitely love to see some concrete plans <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/auryn">@auryn</a> &amp; clr fund would have with the funds? It‚Äôs then easier to maybe setup some milestones or identify concrete benefits deriving from this disbursement of funds</p>
