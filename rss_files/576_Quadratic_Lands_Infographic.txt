    Back when GitcoinDAO launched, the governance token distribution experience was called "[Quadratic Lands](https://quadraticlands.com/)."

We could have dryly named today‚Äôs launch ‚ÄúGovernance Token Distribution Center‚Äù, but we didn‚Äôt.  *Quadratic Lands* üåà was conceived as a meme for a place where community goods are well funded with non-coercive market-based mechanisms + digital democracy reigns. 

I wanted to let everyone know that [SuperModular](https://supermodular.xyz/), which still maintains [https://store.gitcoin.co/](https://store.gitcoin.co/), dropped a new item on the store today - **the Quadratic Lands Treasure Map Infographic.**

Here it is.

This treasure map is meant to be a celebration of the journey that Gitcoin has been on from 2017-2022.
