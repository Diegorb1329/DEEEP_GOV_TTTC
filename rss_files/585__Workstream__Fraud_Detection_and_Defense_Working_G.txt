**Gitcoin was under attack...**

**With the weapons of knowledge, many from the ecosystem came to defend...**

**They built a machine learning algorithm to flag fraud‚Ä¶**

**But algorithms must be tuned to serve the needs of the community, else we risk punishing the innocent...**

**And now, the Gitcoin Galaxy needs your help to decide friend or foe... the best of machine learning with the social discretion of humans, to restore peace and justice to the Quadratic Lands of the Gitcoin galaxy...**

# About the workstream

The Anti-Fraud & Collusion Detection working group is analyzing Gitcoin data to explore mechanism design solutions for Sybil-Resistance.

# Origins of this initiative

After GG Round 6, Gitcoin leaders reached out to [BlockScience](https://block.science/) to engage in modelling and simulation work to examine the quadratic funding system for attack vectors, and how to defend them to create a more resilient system. That work opened the opportunity for a multi-disciplinary research initiative and discussions around the algorithmic governance design of the grants sybil and collusion-detection ecosystem. The research group was formed out of an #OpenScience collaboration between Gitcoin, BlockScience, [Token Engineering Academy](https://tokenengineeringcommunity.github.io/website/) & [Token Engineering Commons](https://tecommons.org/) Labs, which ran an eight week study of grants data. You can read more in this [notion library](https://www.notion.so/blockscience/Gitcoin-Modelling-Co-Lab-TL-DR-Public-4e115525dbc0430289bb78d60ad79a04) of the Co-Lab.

This work will now be carried forward in this workstream, and will take the initiative through the next steps of the process - getting the stewards up to speed on the work that has been done so far, and empowering them with computer-aided policymaking tools. With these tools, they will provide critical feedback to help decide on appropriate boundaries and values in line with the Gitcoin community. Stewards will help to build appropriate governance processes and manage modifications, community feedback integration and other needs as they arise to improve fraud and collusion prevention.

# Workstream Ops

The workstream has two pipelines:

**1. ML/Data Science**

**2. Governance Education**

The initial workstream team is made up of members of the BlockScience and Gitcoin teams, and stewards will be invited to participate.

# The Rollout

The two pipeline teams are working side by side to develop the technical frameworks and two educational workshops that will begin to further decentralize decision making in governance of gitcoin grants in relation to anti-fraud and collusion detection. There are several choices that need to be made i.e whether to tune the algorithm for sensitivity - to widen its scope (more false positives), or narrow its lens for specificity (less positives get flagged) and how to handle edge cases. For the process, we will work with sample data to see how this works in reality, and transition from ‚Äúthe spirit of the law‚Äù to the ‚Äúletter of the law‚Äù in application and policy making.

We have sketched out the initial discovery process and what we will need to determine to get this initiative off the ground:

* Define the mandate  
* Education of Stewards
* First Policy Considerations
* Defining the appeals process
* Defining the sanctions process
* Establishing processes to modify the processes
* Defining KPIs and feedback loops
* Defining operations considerations

# The Road Ahead

![|413x237](upload://jlhBLdKt2XHkfK2XgC22oZUbn4q.png)
*‚ÄúThe Boston #TE Party‚Äù - #TokenEngineering*

Most algorithms that affect our lives are black boxed, and we have no say over the policy decisions or tuning of systems we engage with every day. This is among the first initiatives in history to empower collective decision making in [computer-aided governance](https://medium.com/block-science/computer-aided-governance-cag-a-revolution-in-automated-decision-support-systems-9faa009e57a2).

The road ahead is long, and we are charting new territory, but together, with the light of knowledge and taking conscious steps, we can build towards a grants system of the people, by the people (with algorithmic assistance), and for the people.

            <p>Hey, is this workstream still active?</p>
<p>The team over at GoodDollar would like to get in touch with you. We like your Passport initiative, and would like to be part of it. Our G$ Wallet works as a form of self sovereign identity, and we recently built functionality to ‚ÄúSign in with GoodDollar‚Äù so users can easily register to services that work with G$s. Each one of our 400k+ claimers have been individually verified as a unique human being through biometric 3D face verification with 1:125M false positives and less than 1% false negatives. Photos are not stored, so there is no honeypot. As such, our solution could act as a very good spam/bot prevention, much more useful than Google/Facebook/Twitter. We would be honored to be included alongside BrightID, Idena and PoH to help GitCoin validate unique-human registrations <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p>Hi all! Why aren‚Äôt you using biometric authentication technology to protect against fraud? There is an excellent project Humanode, which allows you to identify a person by biometric characteristics with a certain frequency. In my opinion, this is an excellent tool for protecting against multi-accounts. You can consider the possibility of cooperation with Humanode.</p>

            <p>Greetings humans! I wanted to create a workstream on Moving to the price of forgery, but just noticed this one. Think it‚Äôs better to publish here.</p>
<h1>
<a name="moving-to-the-price-of-forgery-turning-gitcoin-into-identity-provider-1" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#moving-to-the-price-of-forgery-turning-gitcoin-into-identity-provider-1"></a>Moving to the price of forgery + turning gitcoin into identity provider.</h1>
<h2>
<a name="quality-control-of-human-verification-methods-2" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#quality-control-of-human-verification-methods-2"></a>Quality control of human verification methods</h2>
<p>(or the way we assign trust bonuses to verification methods)</p>
<p>Systems like Proof of Humanity, Bright ID, Idena, POAP and ENS are already doing an amazing job in moving towards a no-bots future. Yet there‚Äôs room for improvement. Which is better quality control and a fairer trust bonus for each method as a result.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/adamscochran">@Adamscochran</a> <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/establishing-a-new-process-for-identify-verification-scoring-and-removing-troubled-id-methods/7506">proposed</a> to create a standard assessment procedure for new (and existing) methods. The procedure is incredibly detailed and exhaustive. It can describe literally any existing verification method quantitatively. Yet as well as the current procedure it is‚Ä¶</p>
<p><strong>‚Ä¶subjective.</strong> we cannot predict the ingenuity of malicious actors. There‚Äôs no way we can think of all the exploits for a particular verification method. And there‚Äôs no simple way we can tell the method was exploited. An exploited verification method + exploited quality control algorithm is a Trojan horse for a bot army. So the first problem is the high risk to be a step behind malicious actors.</p>
<p><strong>‚Ä¶and speculative.</strong> See how <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/adamscochran">@Adamscochran</a> scored Idena. It is so low that Idena would be kicked out of the approved methods. I‚Äôd disagree with that. I love Idena and most probably would propose a different scoring for it or probably would demand to reconsider weights in scoring parameters. But we cannot really determine which weights or scores are right. Thus the second problem is the lack of objective measurement. Without it, we leave room for political games, biased opinions, and unproductive disputes (same as disputes on religion, politics, vaccines;)).</p>
<h2>
<a name="how-price-of-forgery-works-3" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#how-price-of-forgery-works-3"></a>How price of forgery works</h2>
<p>The solution to both of the problems described is the price of forgery concept.</p>
<p>The main idea is that the user score is valued in dollars and the user can grab these dollars at any time. After that, the user‚Äôs ID is deleted forever. The procedure is called ‚Äúexplosion‚Äù in Upala terms (we invented the concept and building the protocol implementing it). I‚Äôll use the term further.</p>
<p>With the price of forgery approach, we don‚Äôt have to rely on any assumptions about any verification method. The market will drive the scoring of each method to its price of forgery organically. We also get an assurance for future exploits. If a method got hacked we would see it immediately through an increased explosion rate. That would mean the method should be fixed, or its score should be decreased.</p>
<ul>
<li>See more on <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/price-of-forgery-digital-identity-measuring-human-uniqueness-score-in-dollars/8328" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">the price of forgery in this article on EthResearch</a>
</li>
<li>See what we are <a href="https://www.notion.so/UPALA-DASHBOARD-a46d88209ecb4a4cabf1560acc8673a2" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">up to in Upala</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="how-gitcoin-may-benefit-4" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#how-gitcoin-may-benefit-4"></a>How Gitcoin may benefit</h2>
<p>Price of forgery gives the ability to quality control human verification methods with market forces. It is unbiased, precise, and responsive to new exploits. For the verification methods It would mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fairer trust bonuses</li>
<li>Automated, transparent, and ongoing quality control</li>
<li>Incentive for third parties to bring new verification methods or invent new ones</li>
</ul>
<p>The benefits from shifting to the price of forgery go a bit further than ‚Äújust‚Äù quality control. Gitcoin has tremendous data on interactions on the platform. It is then possible to aggregate scores from multiple sources for a single user (which trust bonuses do), and also append an additional trust bonus to award ‚Äúproper‚Äù internal interaction. That would benefit users and will help assess own algorithms (help understand better what the ‚Äúproper‚Äù behavior is).</p>
<p>And even further. With all that data and algorithms measured with the price of forgery Gitcoin may start providing its own digested scores to other DApps and earn on that (Upala protocol allows to do that). Due to the high user base, it may become a starting point for a decentralized identity system of the future.</p>

<a name="work-done-next-steps-and-coordination-5" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#work-done-next-steps-and-coordination-5"></a>Work done, next steps, and coordination</h2>
<p>You can track progress on developing the price of forgery protocol here (looking for contributors by the way - we‚Äôve got Ampere-hours!).</p>
<p>I had a talk with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a> about the price of forgery back in September 2020. Then described integration in this <a href="https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/issues/7888" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">github issue</a>. I learned recently that Gitcoin is continuing on the idea - <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/establishing-a-new-process-for-identify-verification-scoring-and-removing-troubled-id-methods/7506/2">thread</a>. So seems like the Upala‚Äôs price of forgery concept is already approved. Though I haven‚Äôt had any conversation with the gitcoin team on this and I don‚Äôt see any coordination. As Gitcoin is decentralized now I thought it is a good idea to start the discussion here.</p>

            <p>We may not be able to totally eliminate these unwholesome practices, but we can make it too expensive so that it becomes less unprofitable. the use of BrightID and other such verification will go a long way to solve the problem.</p>

  <p>It began with a call‚Ä¶


Gitcoin was under attack‚Ä¶


With the weapons of knowledge, many from the ecosystem came to defend‚Ä¶


They built a machine learning algorithm to flag fraud‚Ä¶


But algorithms must be tuned to serve the needs of the community,...</p>
