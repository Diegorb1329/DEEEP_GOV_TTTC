**üëâ Key actions for this week:**

1. Please provide your feedback [on the workstream budget proposals](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/governance-proposals/5). Discussion has been [extended to May 10th](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/season-13-2-1-4-30-aligning-the-workstream-budgets-to-make-life-easier-for-the-stewards/9738/11) with Snapshot proposals going live on May 11th.
2. GitcoinDAO‚Äôs anniversary is right around the corner! We‚Äôre requesting [your input](https://pol.is/3r2ajtjve2) on what to include in our year-in-review! If you‚Äôve been a workstream contributor we would also appreciate if you could fill out [this quick survey](https://dvsvwyompza.typeform.com/to/s5s1J428)

## üî• Hot Topics:

* The [GitcoinDAO Governance Process V3](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-dao-governance-process-v3/10358/) is the source of truth for details on how the DAO is governed. It outlines the roles and responsibilities of contributors, delegates, and stewards. It describes the processes used to move proposals through different stages so they can be agreed on and executed. This includes how new and existing workstreams can be funded. The process also includes details about the role of the CSDO (Cross Stream DAO Ops) as a coordination layer among workstreams to discuss, review, and ratify DAO-wide initiatives.

* [Joe](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/disruptionjoe/summary) shares a [Data Analysis for Season 14 Budget Proposals](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/data-analysis-for-season-14-budget-proposals/10456) which compares season 14 to 13 in terms of each workstream's budget and requested amount. The data analysis highlights that PGF, MMM, and DAO Ops workstreams are asking for more funding than season 13 while FDD, MC, and dCompass are asking for less.

* Owocki shares a [S14 Voter Guide Template ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-voter-guide-template/10488)to encourage intersubjective consensus through stewards clearly articulating what they are voting for and why.

* [Vivek](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/vivek/summary) amends the [S14 KERNEL Budget Request](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-amended-kernel-budget-request/10444) by lowering the funding request from $900k to $576k USD (a 36% reduction). This change is following [specific feedback](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-amended-kernel-budget-request/10444/10) from [@ceresstation](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation/summary)and [Linda](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/linda/summary).

* The [Season 14 Budget Request for dCompass](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-dcompass-budget-request/10412/6) by [Huxwell](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/huxwell/summary) features [questions](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-dcompass-budget-request/10412/6) from [QZ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/fishbiscuit/summary) about how the funds from last quarter can carry over to cover most of the requested budget. The workstream only needs an additional 3.5k GTC to meet its S14 budget request.

* The [budget request for decentralizing Gitcoin Kudos](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-decentralize-gitcoin-kudos-budget-request/10442/) has [questions](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-decentralize-gitcoin-kudos-budget-request/10442/2) from [Simona](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/pop/summary) and [Joe](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/disruptionjoe/summary) about the background of the proposed team and the need for soulbound NFTs. [@ceresstation](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation/summary) [agrees](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-decentralize-gitcoin-kudos-budget-request/10442/9) with [Joe](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/disruptionjoe/summary) about wanting to know how this fits into Gitcoin‚Äôs product roadmap for Grants 2.0.

* [The overton window for Grants 2.0 ‚è≥ ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-overton-window-for-grants-2-0/10461) by [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary) discusses how there is a window of time for [Grants 2.0](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-2-0/9981) to come into existence and that window is closing. We have a lot of (friendly) competition for market share that has more velocity than us yet we have way more resources than our competition.

* [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary) requests proposals for [ImpactDAO Category Creation](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/impactdao-category-creation-proposals-wanted/10500) and [Impact Certificates](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/impact-certificates-proposals-wanted/10499). Creating ImpactDAO as a category means amplifying understanding of what an ImpactDAO is and helping ImpactDAOs be successful. Impact Certificates create legitimacy around who has created impact for social good and ‚Äúcould get really powerful if we were able to create buy pressure for Impact Certificates‚Äù

* [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary) shares his [Practical Pluralism Essay Draft](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/practical-pluralism-essay-draft-req-for-feedback/10462/) and requests feedback. Pluralism is the understanding that diversity within a given context generally results in better outcomes. For the Ethereum ecosystem to be antifragile, we need technological diversity of clients, RPC nodes, funding mechanisms and cultural diversity of people, communities, opinions.

* [8 Ideas for DAO Work @ Maximum Coordination ‚Ñ¢](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/8-ideas-for-dao-work-maximum-coordination/10483) by [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary) explores how we can improve workstream budgeting, structure, and coordination. Three of the eight featured ideas (thinner workstreams, subDAOs, Orca pods) focus on creating smaller groups to allocate funding to. Another three of the eight (conviction voting, Coordinape, higher fidelity voting) focus on creating more granular governance processes for how to determine where funds should flow.

## [üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Workstream Discussion](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/workstream-discussion/9)

### [üå± Public Goods Funding](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Public-Goods-4ccd579f433c4dff9d8952314468d6e8)

* In our [season 14 budget request](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-public-goods-funding-budget-request/10443), [Linda](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/linda/summary) and [Simona](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/pop/summary) [ask for details](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-public-goods-funding-budget-request/10443) around why the budget amount for the Public Library is as high as $90k USD for one season. [QZ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/fishbiscuit/summary) [explains this is the same amount](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-public-goods-funding-budget-request/10443/3) as last season and the library is also the primary source for onboarding new contributors.
[Kyle](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle/summary) [suggests](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-public-goods-funding-budget-request/10443/5) a 45% budget reduction from 160k GTC to 88.75k GTC [@ceresstation](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation/summary) [responds](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-public-goods-funding-budget-request/10443/7) that it‚Äôs bad principle to restrict the budget because it went unspent, the DAO workstream is gaining employees from holdings, the safe could be updated, and they are already taking the bear market into mind.

### [üöÄ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-prototyping-workstream-moonshot-budget-request-q4-2021/8785) [Moonshot Collective](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Moonshot-Collective-ffa78f44a0de412cb607f9b69d3a376f)

* In the collective‚Äôs [season 14 budget request](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-moonshot-collective-budget-request/10446/2), [Kyle](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle/summary) shares [his sentiment](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-moonshot-collective-budget-request/10446) that the budget should be reduced by 19.2% from 103.7K GTC to 83.8K. [QEDK](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/qedk/summary) [points out](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-moonshot-collective-budget-request/10446/3) that Moonshot‚Äôs mission is to be more than a prototyping workstream, it is to further public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole (such as by having contributors who are involved with regen projects like the Citizen House and Token Collective). [Joe](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/disruptionjoe/summary) [recommends](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-moonshot-collective-budget-request/10446/5) focusing on finding solutions for problems faced by other workstreams at GitcoinDAO.

* Do not miss this very special episode of the [Green Pill Podcast](https://availableon.com/greenpill) hosted by [Kevin Owocki](https://twitter.com/owocki)! In [this episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqe8xel9hsA), Kevin is joined by [Phoebe Tikkel](https://twitter.com/solarpunk_girl?s=20&t=bXKL_f2KXubdkFBcdW6xYA) (aka Solarpunk Girl) who is the founder of [Moral Imaginations](https://www.moralimaginations.com/), an organization using collective imagination tooling to make a more harmonious world.

### [üíô Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Fraud-Detection-Defense-2bde13c0b8e74fda81435d94e49e2703)

* FDD‚Äôs [season 14 budget request](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-fdd-season-14-budget-request/10448/2) includes comments where several community members express their gratitude and excitement for FDD while looking forward to greater inter-squad cohesion. [QZ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/fishbiscuit/summary) [asks for additional focus](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-fdd-season-14-budget-request/10448/13) on Grants Policy communication, removal of FDD storytelling, and more inter-WS discussions. [Joe](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/disruptionjoe/summary) [responds that](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-fdd-season-14-budget-request/10448/16) much of this highlights the need for increased communication, which storytellers can do.
[Kyle](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle/summary) [suggests a 43% budget reduction](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-fdd-season-14-budget-request/10448/25) from 118K GTC to 67K and says ‚ÄúGitcoin seems to be paying for the education and advancement of a number of ideas - Sybil DAO, Most of ‚ÄòEvolution‚Äô, Catalyst, etc. without any discernible increase in value being delivered back to the DAO.‚Äù [Joe](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/disruptionjoe/summary) [points out FDD‚Äôs role](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-fdd-season-14-budget-request/10448/27) in solving problems which existentially affect Gitcoin‚Äôs future, that quadratic funding does not work without sybil resistance, and FDD‚Äôs focus on creating a decentralized protocol.

* [Mandates delivery report (open for feedback) ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/mandates-delivery-report-open-for-feedback/10470)by [kishoraditya](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kishoraditya/summary) explores how to create metrics for processes within DAOs. These metrics focus on evaluating FDD core teams and/or functions such as Grants Investigation Agency, Sybil, and Project Management. The metrics were drafted through creating feedback loops with relevant SMEs to ensure high trust in the system.

* The Rewards Modeling squad‚Äôs [OKR Report](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gia-rewards-okr-report/10438) provides a solution for the community to not only own the [Grants 2.0](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/grants-2-0-is-how-we-scale-our-impact/10015) infrastructure but also the structures which allow communities to meaningfully access it. According to [Disruption Joe](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/disruptionjoe/summary), we should ‚Äúnot only build the resource allocation infrastructure of the future with [Grants 2.0](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/grants-2-0-is-how-we-scale-our-impact/10015), but ensure there are onramps for all voices to be heard.‚Äù This system would allow for anyone to participate in moderating for grant eligibility, sybil users, and any other subjective decisions the community needs to make. If we don't want content moderation to be censored by a large company or single point of failure, we need to decentralize the inputs to the system.

### [üé® Merch, Memes & Marketing](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Merch-Memes-and-Marketing-60cc693f0fe14be1879a05587922c8a3)

* The MMM [season 14 budget proposal](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-memes-merch-marketing-budget-request/10440/2) has [questions ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-memes-merch-marketing-budget-request/10440/2)from [Simona](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/pop/summary) regarding if PR/Comms from YAP Global are needed. [Kyle](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle/summary) shares [his sentiment](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-memes-merch-marketing-budget-request/10440/4) that MMM should reduce budget by 21% from 167.7K to 132.5K GTC in order to cut out ‚Äúnice-to-haves‚Äù. [Joe](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/disruptionjoe/summary) supports the current budget but [points out](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-memes-merch-marketing-budget-request/10440/9) a lack of clear, measurable metrics.
Sean [updates the budget proposal](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-memes-merch-marketing-budget-request/10440/10) to reduce the funding request by 9% from $923k to $841k USD by eliminating virtual events funding and decreasing the funding request for Content, Brand, and Ops substreams.

* [Memepalooza 8](https://twitter.com/GitcoinDAO/status/1521155860625604609) is happening this Friday from 6 to 8 PM UTC. We‚Äôll be memeing on all things web3 & public goods in our discord with our friends from [Prime DAO](http://prime.xyz/) and [CultDAO](https://cultdao.io/). [You won‚Äôt wanna miss this](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/eventedit/copy/MmI0MWQ2aWljazlmMTRtcXJiN3Nrb3FnNmkgY184YWJuZ2thY292cjZ0NGpncXZrZWRiaW5vMEBn/ZnJlZEBnaXRjb2luLmNv?sf=true)!

### [‚òÄÔ∏è DAO Operations](https://gitcoin.notion.site/DAO-Ops-84f425e281ae49579a2b4acf0bad5dd5)

* [Kyle](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle/summary) [proposes a 4% budget reduction](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-dao-operations-s14-budget-request/10447/6) from 115K to 110K GTC in [our season 14 budget](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-dao-operations-s14-budget-request/10447/2). [Joe](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/disruptionjoe/summary) [asks for outcome definitions](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-dao-operations-s14-budget-request/10447/8) which focus on connection to problems faced by DAO Ops customers (other workstreams) and more clearly defined success metrics.
Jodi [responds with a proposal](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-dao-operations-s14-budget-request/10447/11) to remove specific-to-accounting reserves and reduce professional development budget by 50% to lower the overall workstream budget by 5.4k GTC. She [goes on to discuss](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s14-proposal-dao-operations-s14-budget-request/10447/15) how the workstream arrived at our OKRs, how we prioritize work, and how we attach accountability to people.

* On our [weekly CSDO call](https://www.notion.so/CSDO-Cross-Stream-DAO-Ops-30-801e1ed81193477c89da444df542475e) we decided to extend the time workstreams have before their budgets go to Snapshot, create an extra steward council call for budget discussion, and test a new [Gitcoin Conflict Resolution Policy](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Gitcoin-Conflict-Resolution-Policy-d4c7a0c937884f53a05bdc83e09314a7) within the DAO Ops workstream.

* In [Treasury Diversification Working Group Updates](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/treasury-diversification-working-group-updates-thread/10231/9), [Kyle](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle/summary) discusses the potential for a bear market and Gitcoin‚Äôs role as the light that fuels the ecosystem. Because of that, Gitcoin needs to ‚Äúreally focus on the core thesis that we are a protocol DAO with great impact (funding for public goods).‚Äù The post takes the stance that Gitcoin budgets have grown faster than protocol development and we should consider new ways for us to continue to fund ourselves.

* We are hiring! We are still looking for a qualified [Support Lead.](https://twitter.com/GitcoinDAO/status/1511043414317584384?s=20&t=Xs18hYXcltlTH658zdlzLA) We also just put up a new role for someone to join us as a [Community Management Lead!](https://twitter.com/GitcoinDAO/status/1521575840080879617)

<p>The <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-dao-governance-process-v3/10358/">GitcoinDAO Governance Process V3</a> is the source of truth for details on how the DAO is governed. It outlines the roles and responsibilities of contributors, delegates, and stewards. It describes the processes used to move proposals through different stages so they can be agreed on and executed. This includes how new and existing workstreams can be funded. The process also includes details about the role of the CSDO (Cross Stream DAO Ops) as a coordination layer among workstreams to discuss, review, and ratify DAO-wide initiatives.</p>
