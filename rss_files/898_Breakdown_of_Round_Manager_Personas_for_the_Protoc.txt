Breakdown of Round Manager Personas for the Protocol
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/breakdown-of-round-manager-personas-for-the-protocol/11775
    Our current planning initiatives are trending toward lumping three distinct personas into one. We are currently using the term ‚ÄúRound Owner‚Äù or ‚ÄúRound Manager‚Äù as our catch-all bucket for personas that interact with a matching pool and/or the round manager interface. This post is intended to spark conversation around the clearly different interest & incentives for each persona in the Round Manager value chain. 

## This is an initial attempt at breaking down these personas.

Here is the [Miro link](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPJc88tc=/?share_link_id=755374366478) (edit - Gitcoin team & comment - everyone else)

The protocol will incentivize ‚ÄúRound Operators‚Äù to solicit ‚ÄúEcosystem Owners‚Äù who in turn have obligations to the provider of the matching pool funds.

### Things we can say about Ecosystem Owners

* They are interested in building the community round over round
* Finding funding is their primary objective to exist
* They may work for a Lead Match Pool Funder
* Are likely very motivated by the CAUSE or ECOSYSTEM they support
* May have to act as the round operator until their ecosystem is large enough

### Things we can say about Round Operators

* Their primary focus is executing flawless end to end operations during a round
* They are not concerned with finding matching pool funders
* Many ecosystems will hire Gitcoin to operate their rounds

## Conclusion

It would be great to have the conversation continue here and in the [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPJc88tc=/?share_link_id=755374366478)!
