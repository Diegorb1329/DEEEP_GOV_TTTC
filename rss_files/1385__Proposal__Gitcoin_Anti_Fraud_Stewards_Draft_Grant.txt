[Proposal] Gitcoin Anti-Fraud Stewards Draft Grant Proposal
David_Dyor

            <p>Yes these questions are great.  Thanks for the feedback,</p>
<p>There are many criteria including names, websites, wallets and social media accounts.  Usually the entire application is scrutinized and links get followed.  We try to get a sense of the applicant.  When a team is made of OG, OG1, OG2, and there is no additional information the grant is typically flagged or denied.</p>

  <p>It began with a callâ€¦


Gitcoin was under attackâ€¦


With the weapons of knowledge, many from the ecosystem came to defendâ€¦


They built a machine learning algorithm to flag fraudâ€¦


But algorithms must be tuned to serve the needs of the community,...</p>

            <p>For example, during a recent hackathon, I think one of the sponsors committed fraud by not awarding the bounty, relying on friendly language and vague requirements.  20 submissions for the prize were all rejected with no clear explanation.</p>

            <p>Hello <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/david_dyor">@David_Dyor</a>! Thank you for the proposal.</p>
<p>I have some questions about the doc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shaping the future of anti sybil: Work in gamifying the approvals process, working with other DAOs to provide heads up about users found to colluding</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How do you identify a user in this case? Thatâ€™s the entire problem of sybil. Itâ€™s just an ethereum address. They just abandon it and make another one. So what user data would you forward to other DAOs?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Operational functions of fraud detection</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That section needs better formatting and re-wording a bit. I found it quite hard to read and understand. At least split the subsections into their own paragraphs.</p>
<hr>
<p>All in all if this is for a grant in the gitcoin builds gitcoin category I think this is a really good idea. Would be interested to learn more about the processes you plan to follow but that is offtopic to the proposal here.</p>
