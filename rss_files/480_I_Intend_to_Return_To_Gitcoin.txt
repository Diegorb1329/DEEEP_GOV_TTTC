https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/i-intend-to-return-to-gitcoin/16452
    *(Note: This thread assumes you're familiar with my history with Gitcoin.  But for those of you who arent, I'm Kevin Owocki, co-founder of Gitcoin and was active in the project 2017-2022 until [Passing the Torch](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/passing-the-torch/10971))*

Last week I announced that Supermodular would now become Buildbox and I would be leaving the company. Details on that [here](https://community.supermodular.xyz/t/supermodular-buidlbox/502/2).

So what‚Äôs next?

I intend to work on Gitcoin.

Not forever, and not in the role I was in in the past. I am still figuring out in what form I can contribute productively to Gitcoin at this stage.

I will be having conversations with people who work in, around what needs to be done and where I can help out with various people associated with the DAO.

I count these groups as the primary Constituents of the DAO

* Contributors
* Users
* Stewards
* Partners
* Developers
* Really anyone who cares about Gitcoin and has skin in the game to show it.

Over the last few months, I have heard variously from different people who think that things are going great for Gitcoin, and also from people who think they are going poorly. There are those who think that the market has passed Gitcoin by, and also those who think that there are new stronger foundations for the future.

I have heard various takes on me possibly returning from ‚ÄúKevin we really need you back.‚Äù and ‚ÄúA founder leaving can be hard.‚Äù to ‚ÄúKevin you're a bull in a china shop.‚Äù or ‚ÄúKevin needs to decentralize his delegations‚Äù or ‚Äúbecome more conscious in leadership‚Äù.

There are people who think that Allo is the next hot thing for Gitcoin, who think Passport is the next hot thing for Gitcoin, who think PGN is the next hot thing, and who think Grants Stack is the next hot thing.

I am hoping that through synthesis between these varying groups, I can find a way to provide value to the DAO. Perhaps I could be a network catalyst insofar as I‚Äôd providing synthesis between different groups.

I‚Äôd also be interested in helping documenting/articulate the path forwards for the DAO bottoms-up by working with these varied stakeholders.

I‚Äôll be figuring it out over the coming weeks.

If you have feedback or want to chat, DM me on discord Owocki#1337 or telegram owocki.

            <p>I think you can help in keeping Gitcoins brand values and integrity intact, the current core didn‚Äôt even care to think Shell would damage the Gitcoin brand. And after all the backlash they still did not listen to the community, and Shell is still in‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Also a bit suspicious the Shell decision happened right after you left, I‚Äôm sure a corporate <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/male_detective.png?v=12" title=":male_detective:" class="emoji" alt=":male_detective:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> would bring some interesting results.</p>
<p>Anyway point is we don‚Äôt need wallstreet business mentality in here, we need people who build a better world.</p>
