    ## Gitcoin DAO 2025 Builder and Event Strategy - Expand Builder Engagement and Strengthen Global Presence

### TL;DR

The true strength of Gitcoin lies in its vibrant community of builders. To ensure the long-term resilience of the ecosystem, we are developing systems to recognize, retain, and empower our builder community. This approach creates a mutually beneficial dynamicâ€”a win-win-winâ€”for Gitcoin, our partners, and the builders themselves. By leveraging our expertise and community connections, we aim to solidify our position as leaders in grants and public goods funding.

Reflecting on 2024, we recognized that a stronger presence at mission-aligned events fosters deeper relationships and strengthens our community. Feedback from builders and ecosystem partners underscored the value of engaging directly at these gatherings. As we move into the new year, Gitcoin is committed to implementing a more impactful and strategic events plan to build connections, amplify engagement, and nurture the ecosystem.
