    **Treasury Diversification Working Group Update - 2/19/2022**

**Update from Last Week**
This week, our focus was on reaching out to potential strategic partners. There should be more to share next week as we begin having initial conversations!

* Reached out to DAOs, VCs, and other potential candidates to have them fill out our interest form.


**Plan for This Week**

* Process any form submissions
* Begin to have initial calls with partners
* Continue to clarify terms of the partnership (e.g. vesting schedule, etc.)
* Share any conflicts of interest (as defined in our Ethics Policy in [forum post 2 ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/treasury-diversification-part-ii-welcoming-strategic-partners/9825)).


**Asks from the Community**
Our focus is still on reaching out to potential strategic partners to have initial conversations.

With that in mind, if youâ€™d like to recommend a candidate strategic partner, please leave a comment on the second forum post or contact a member of the working group. If you have other questions or feedback, please feel free to leave a comment on this thread!
