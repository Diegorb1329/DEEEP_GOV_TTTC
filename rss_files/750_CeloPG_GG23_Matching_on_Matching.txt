https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/celopg-gg23-matching-on-matching/20104
    ### Round Selection

As part of the [CeloPG Season 0](https://forum.celo.org/t/budget-request-celopg-season-0/10125), CeloPG initiated a ‚Äò[matching on matching](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg23-community-rounds-eligibility-criteria/19924/2?u=montymerlin)‚Äô program with up to $25k available across GG23 community rounds that choose to run on Celo. This initiative aims to empower impactful grant rounds, facilitate collaboration, and support the growth of the Celo ecosystem.

After evaluating each application submitted to the [GG23 Applications Grantship](https://gg23.grantships.com/applications) and engaging with various round operator leads, CeloPG would like to offer support to the following rounds (pending the deployment of the round on Celo network, and other round-specific agreements).

### Future Potential

* **Code 3 Clubs**: While not passing eligibility for this round, we connected the team with Celo Africa DAO and look forward to future collaborations.
* **Token Engineering the Superchain Retro Round**: Round is running on Optimism. With the [CEL2 launch scheduled for March 26th](https://forum.celo.org/t/returning-home-to-ethereum-the-launch-of-celo-l2-mainnet/10466) we would be excited to explore future collaboration opportunities with TEC.
* **Gitcoin Grants Garden üå±**: Excited about the launch of the [Gardens v2](https://app.gardens.fund/gardens). While not currently deployed on Celo, we‚Äôre eager to explore future potential here.
* **CeLatam**: Exploring potential for a Celo focused Latin America funding program in future rounds.

If you are planning a future funding round or have other ideas for collaboration with CeloPG, please reach out to @MontyMerlin or @Luukdao.

### CeloPG x Regen Coordination x Ethereum Localism

In addition to this matching on matching program, CeloPG also allocated a $10k budget to support the [Regen Coordination ImpactQF](https://gg23.grantships.com/view-draft/0x2377bfa0777c385f4d3fdee97d1a65228f836da67ea6f0db96235870ac5cdc82-0) round. With this post, this support has now been extended to ReFi Mediterranean, Regen Rio de Janeiro, and Zazelenimo Split Urban Greening. This growing collaboration marks the expanding roots of a transformative movement‚Äî‚ÄòEthereum Localism‚Äô.

Ethereum Localism refers to the use of Web3 tools and infrastructure to empower local communities, municipalities, and bioregions, enabling decentralized funding flows, civic innovation, and regenerative economics. By supporting these initial localized funding rounds, we aim to lay the groundwork for a larger, decentralized network of local communities and projects empowered by aligned methodologies and Ethereum infrastructure. If successful, these pilots will not only demonstrate the potential of Web3-powered local economies, but also catalyze broader investment and adoption of Ethereum-based solutions in real-world communities.
