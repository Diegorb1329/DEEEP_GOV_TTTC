## üî• Hot Topics:

* [Schelling Point Amsterdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9VttmSNYRs&list=PLvTrX8LNPbPlLNcFPuWiac3W19cUSaKFF) was hosted on April 21st at the Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky. We loved seeing you there, making memories together, and planning our solarpunk future. Check out the [agenda with information](https://schellingpoint.gitcoin.co/#agenda) about the [recorded talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9VttmSNYRs&list=PLvTrX8LNPbPlLNcFPuWiac3W19cUSaKFF), workshops, and unconference sessions.

* [Scott](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation) announced the start of [Constructing a Mutual Grants Committee](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/constructing-a-mutual-grants-committee/10347) to formalize the process behind mutual grant agreements. Stewards and members of the Public Goods Funding Workstream are invited to join the working group. [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary) [raised a question](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/constructing-a-mutual-grants-committee/10347/7) about if the committee will also consider agreements between the DAO and Workstreams which may spin-out to go independent.

* [Fred](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/Fred) [shared](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/data-science-gitcoindao/10088/11) a new [dashboard](https://dune.com/ivanmolto/GitcoinDAO:-The-case-for-Governor-Alpha) from the MMM Workstream that deep dives into the GitcoinDAO Governor Alpha setup filled with some interesting metrics and information.

* [Puncar](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/puncar-dev/s') gives an [update](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-forum-improvement-project/10314/4) on the [Gitcoin Forum Improvement Project](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-forum-improvement-project/10314), coalescing a vision for the forum as ‚Äúan organized, easy-to-navigate active community space where people post their well-thought ideas to get feedback and build a consensus that lasts over time‚Äù. This would include using high-level categories and role-tagging (e.g community, Stewards, etc.) to minimize complexity and maximize the reader‚Äôs ability to find relevant threads.

## [üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Workstream Discussion](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/workstream-discussion/9)

### [üå± Public Goods Funding](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Public-Goods-4ccd579f433c4dff9d8952314468d6e8)

* We are actively working on a [framework for mutual grants](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/constructing-a-mutual-grants-committee/10347) (token swaps) to help ensure we are acting as effective metagovernance stewards.

* [Annika](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/annika) shares some preliminary details for [GR14 Round Structure & Future of the Main Round](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gr14-round-structure-future-of-the-main-round/10391) to get community input. With [Grants 2.0](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-2-0/9981) coming soon to enable anyone to spin up their own QF round, the Public Goods Funding Workstream recommends not changing the main round and instead spinning up a Gitcoin-led Ethereum infrastructure round. The Workstream also recommends Stewards to ratify Gitcoin-led rounds, and plans on more clearly defining platform eligibility criteria.

* We are working on our Season 14 budget proposal and planning to go live next week. While doing so, we are also setting goals for ourselves 12-18 months in advance. The Workstream is especially focused on minimizing the effect of sybil attacks on Gitcoin Grants, improving the quality of data inputs and processes, and empowering contributors to help FDD sustainably deliver on outcomes.

* We want to re-review the entire set of active grants in preparation for Grants 2.0, run three simulations to optimize our review system, and lower the cost per review by at least 50%.

* We have several exciting new developments in the works to improve our operational process and increase the amount of content we‚Äôre creating. This includes a grantee showcase, website migration, and marketing automation platform.

### [‚òÄÔ∏è DAO Operations](https://gitcoin.notion.site/DAO-Ops-84f425e281ae49579a2b4acf0bad5dd5)

* We are hiring! We need a [Hiring Manager](https://twitter.com/GitcoinDAO/status/1509185588599083014?s=20&t=Xs18hYXcltlTH658zdlzLA), and [Support Lead](https://twitter.com/GitcoinDAO/status/1511043414317584384?s=20&t=Xs18hYXcltlTH658zdlzLA).
