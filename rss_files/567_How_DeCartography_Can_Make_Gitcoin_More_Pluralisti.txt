I felt that the concept of "**[Plurality](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/plurality-technology-for-collaborative-diversity-and-democracy/)**" is one of "gouvernementalit√©", including [Pol.is](https://pol.is/) which scales deliberations with digital democracy, Twitter's [Community Notes](https://twitter.github.io/communitynotes/) which was mentioned in the talk, and other histories.

The concept of "governing technology" was proposed by Michel Foucault and is understood as the art of government or governmental rationality.

We find this in modern times as well, Bruce Schneier, a leading expert in the field of information security, has been using the term "Public-Interest Technology" a lot since around 2019.

The "myth" that code is the answer and that technology is politically neutral was widespread, especially in Silicon Valley, and there was a strong aversion to getting involved in politics, but at the beginning of the Obama administration in the US, the manifesto "Government as a Platform" was put forth, and later Tim In September 2009, Jennifer Palka founded Code for America, a non-profit organization that sends IT engineers to local governments across the United States.

**We are currently working on [DeCartography](https://decartography.github.io/docs/), a social diversity protocol to realize a "Plurality World".**

  DeCartography is one of the computational oracles that provide "multidimensional social diversity" between wallet addresses based on on-chain activity on Ethereum.

-  Developers using this oracle can use GraphQL to obtain the multidimensional relationship values between a given wallet address and other wallet addresses or groups (which are lists of wallet addresses).

  - The data used to generate the social graph is determined by the crowdworker. Crowdworkers are rewarded by solving commonsense problems displayed on the platform.

-   The goal is to collect ratings subjectively from each crowdworker and use the "wisdom of crowds" to provide a social graph that is as close to objective as possible.

Proof-of-work, one of the consensus algorithms employed in Bitcoin, etc., in which a large number of nodes allocate a specific cost to become validators to provide a specific function, is a representation (report, vote) based on the premise of 1Person, 1ID 

"people's democratic common sense" represented by 1Person, 1ID as the node of each validator? That is where the experiment begins.

Existing distributed oracles on Ethereum, such as [Augur](https://augur.net/) and [Chainlink](https://chain.link/)" distribute validators based on tokens, but what if we incorporate Meta-Decentralized, Meta-diversity (a concept I created) indicators in the distribution of the validators?
 
I think that would eliminate cases like Chainlink Whale 'Oldwhite' Used More Than 150 Wallets to Avoid Staking Limits.

For example, if the people furthest away from the "Social Distance" reported the same answers as validators, it would pretty much avoid collusion and filter bubbles in the democratic process.

Adapting this to Quadratic Funding, which inherently has the vulnerability of collusion, one could say that ["50 actually independent thinkers are worth more than 1000 NPCs who all consume the same media and vote the same way"](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1580313964067508224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) can be realized.

As a precedent, there is also a precedent in other areas, such as [TruthCoin](https://www.truthcoin.info/)" which creates an oracle based on peer prediction methods in the Bitcoin sidechain.

### proof of (human) work
DeCartography itself can also use the data, although it is self-referential.
Specifically, DeCartography's consensus algorithm itself is inherently at risk of 51% attack, but DeCartography, a Social Divercity Oralce, can use its own data to diversify verifiers.

<p>Governmentality is a concept first developed by the French philosopher Michel Foucault in the later years of his life, roughly between 1977 and his death in 1984, particularly in his lectures at the Coll√®ge de France during this time.
 Governmentality can be understood as:
 Governmentality may also be understood as:
 Peter Miller, Nikolas Rose and Mitchell Dean, among other scholars, have elaborated on the notion of governmentality.
