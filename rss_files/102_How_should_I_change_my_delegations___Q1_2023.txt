How should I change my delegations? [Q1 2023]
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-should-i-change-my-delegations-q1-2023/12693
    by request, i'm starting a thread to present my Q1 2023 delegations.

*(for those of you dont know me, im [kevin owocki](https://twitter.com/owocki) - one of the original cofounders of Gitcoin.  i started Gitcoin in my basement and (along with early hires) took it from nothing to a brand that Joe Lubin/Vitalik Buterin have endorsed with $50mm+ in GMV.  to embrace decentralization of leadership, i [disaffiliated from the DAO's leadership](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/passing-the-torch/10971) last summer.  if you check out [my discourse profile](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary) or [public speaking history](https://owocki.com/public-speaking) you can learn more about me.)*

here are my delegations as they currently stand

![del|307x500](upload://cD52UfIm50TRebP16Urq2lykDS.png)


medium/long term, i'd love to decentralize my GTC voting power among more community members.   my goal is to get each delegatee below 10% of my delegations. [here is my post on that.](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-should-i-change-my-delegations-q3-2022/11132/5).

short term, 
1. i delegated heavily to janine, kyle, olsen, and griff because Gitcoin is in a place of change into a protocolDAO and i see these people actively helping create clarity there.
1. i delegated to griff because I admire what Giveth has done in the space, especially how quickly they iterate, and i'd welcome his presence stewarding Gitcoin. 
1. because of [my disaffiliation](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/passing-the-torch/10971/2) i am not aware of what up & coming talent there is in the DAO.  thus far i've not been getting a ton of inbound on [this form](https://forms.gle/vCvnJfh8N3n52BBH7) so my plan to decentralize my delegations is somewhat stalled.
2. id love to learn more about the up & coming talent in the DAO. please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/vCvnJfh8N3n52BBH7) if you have a recommendation to make.

            <p>I would love to see <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/shawn16400">@shawn16400</a> on this delegation list. He is doing incredible work on the organizational side of GitcoinDAO, really trying to progress this experiment in decentralized organizing and create fair and transparent community governance.</p>
