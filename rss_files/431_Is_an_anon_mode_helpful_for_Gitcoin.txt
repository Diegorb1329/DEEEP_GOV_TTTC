    I have been researching how DAOs make decisions and I am curious about **anonymity**. Since this feature is possible on [discourse](https://meta.discourse.org/t/use-anonymous-mode-to-reply-or-create-topics/240039) and is [easy to enable](https://meta.discourse.org/t/enable-and-configure-anonymous-mode/155638):
1. Have we considered enabling it here
2. If yes, why, if not, why not?

My thesis is that optional anonymity would allow users to communicate candidly without needing to create a throwaway account, and would love your feedback on this.

            <p>Could be of great benefit in filtering applicants - let‚Äôs say if there was an anon time during the review period where the community could point out inconsistencies and where the grant review process should be focused to ensure a more even outcome.</p>

            <p>TBH that‚Äôs something we figured could happen. I have always thought that a reputation system (like stackoverflow) would be useful in gating certain features. (So you are not allowed to post until you lurk/ upvote, then comment for a while)</p>
<p>Of course, that would mean someone needing to create a proposal on Gitcoin would first need to ‚Äògrind‚Äô for a bit, or have accumulated Karma in some other way</p>

            <p>If you‚Äôre referring to anonymous commenting in Discourse, the main reason we don‚Äôt do this is because of bots and spam.</p>
<p>That said, I do see the advantage of both 1) anonymous comments and 2) anonymous, private voting (not just shielded voting, but hiding of the final tally as well and just returning a y/n pass).</p>
<p>I‚Äôm currently working with a group called Fractal on 2).</p>
<p>If you have any suggestions on 1) that would minimize bot/spam action, please let me know. I‚Äôm happy to run some experiments to see if this feature gets used often and creates more productive conversations.</p>
