Proposal: $GTC-Backed Economy
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gtc-backed-economy/8033
    As a first foray into treasury management in collaboration with the #workstream-discussion:public-goods-funding we stewards, @Yalor, @androolloyd @Pop , @HelloShreyas & @AcceleratedCapital propose partnering with the [ICHI](https://www.ichi.org/) community to create $oneGTC: 

## A stablecoin to accelerate the funding of Gitcoin DAO.

# Why

$oneGTC will provide the GitcoinDAO with a toolset for generating greater resources that can go towards digital public goods. It will enable a significantly increased value for $GTC token and greater economic freedom for the contributors of the DAO. By using the ICHI system we are able to unlock the value of the token treasury, allowing us to retain more value within our ecosystem and decrease the sell pressure for our workstream contributors.

* Having a stable token for the GitcoinDAO allows us to fund work streams with certainty, instead of being victims to market fluctuation.

* Using $oneGTC as our preferred token instead of market selling $GTC will lead to retaining more value within the Gitcoin ecosystem (see chart)

* A success of this experiment will lead the way to other open-source projects unlocking the value of their scarce assets, Gitcoin should lead the way in empowering communities and helping them unlock their treasury.

# What:

Following other top projects like Filecoin and 1INCH, we propose partnering with ICHI to build $oneGTC, a stablecoin minted with a mix of $USDC and $GTC.

* $oneGTC is a native stablecoin for funding the ongoing operation of the Gitcoin DAO, as well as rewarding contributors new to the Gitcoin ecosystem.
* ICHI has built the only stablecoin design to be governed by a specific crypto community.
* GitcoinDAO will govern the $oneGTC treasury, and can apply any strategies it likes to grow it‚Äôs collateral, or decide to incentivise activities using it‚Äôs earnings.
* Allocate the next 45,000 GTC outlined[ here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/public-goods-funding-workstream-budget-request/7993) to bootstrap the $oneGTC treasury, with an additional $100k worth of tokens to provide liquidity for the pools, matched by $100k worth of ICHI rewards for LP‚Äôs from the ICHI community.

* [Join an ICHI <> Gitcoin Telegram discussion group ](https://t.me/joinchat/Ke8Vv4Cnfjk1ZDY8)

**Proposal Stage**: ‚úÖ

**Initial Target**:üéØ - The first step to delivering this is to get consensus on the value of this proposal, we require a clear signal via snapshot from the token holders to show their support for this treasury scheme. Once approved the ICHI team can deliver the token treasury in 7 business days. 

**Budget**:üè¶There is no additional budget required to deliver this proposal, we propose using [45,000 GTC allocated to workstreams](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/public-goods-funding-workstream-budget-request/7993) to bootstrap the oneGTC treasury, with $100k in $ICHI provided by the ICHI community to reward liquidity providers who add USDC to the pools. 

**Plan and Timeline**:üè≠ See plan above, timeline is 10-14 days from treasury deposit. 

**Individual/s Responsible**:üëñ We are partnering with the ICHI community a few of whom include: 

* @Lior 
* @37 Aces, Chief Technical Officer 
* @masanobufukuoka, Farmer
* Samuel Mendenhall, core dev
* Vladimir Stemkovski, core dev
* Kobayashi, ecosystem
* Ethan Lehman, community

All ICHI team can be found [here](https://snapshot.org/#/ichi.eth). 

Ultimately they will be responsible for delivering the working treasury scheme and token, and @Yalor & @androolloyd will be responsible for overseeing the work being done and ensuring that it is delivered on-time and within the existing scope outlined above. 

This proposal will be open for discussion for 2 weeks leading up to the next Gitcoin Stewards Call August 2nd, a corresponding snapshot can be found below: 

## [oneGTC - snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/Qmf8du3yfvYvFsXRDQHfUMvafFBAMWb2ujC6KjWQZ8Mqky)  Open Monday July 26th - August 3rd. 

Thank you for engaging with this proposal, even if you just give us your stamp of approval it means a lot. We are here to serve the DAO and hope through the creation of oneGTC to ensure a longer lasting and more sustainable treasury for years to come ü•Ç

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/lefterisjp">@lefterisjp</a> , sorry to read that is your vote, but I do want to emphasize one point as I see it gained some people‚Äôs concern -</p>
<p>My personal believe is that in DeFi and crypto in general, there cannot be rent seeking fees as a general rule, as it‚Äôs always possible to fork and reduce the fee to the minimum.</p>
<p>That is why the way I look at it is that the purpose in the fee model is to ensure alignment of interests between the projects - if Gitcoin won‚Äôt gain value from $oneGTC - neither does ICHI , and as such the goal is to get to an equilibrium of value add and fair split. This was one of the things I like about ICHI and what made me propose it to the Gitcoin community in the first place.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm Looking forward continue this conversation in the future!</p>

            <p>Thanks for all the great questions. To reiterate Lior‚Äôs comment: the idea behind the fee model is to align the incentives in the system. The fees are designed to reflect a share of yield, and would not impact a loan to treasury from the Gitcoin community. These fees would also not put the stability of the stablecoins at risk.</p>

            <p>Hey fellow gitcoin community members.</p>
<p>After the call yesterday and after careful consideration I am going to vote No for this paritcular proposal.</p>
<p>The reasons are similar to what was mentioned in the call and above in the post by other stewards. I believe it‚Äôs too early in the process to consider creating a gitcoin specific stablecoin while a normal and more established stablecoin would probably serve us better.</p>
<p>Even though I appreciate all the work the ICHI community put in the proposal, before looking at this proposal I had not heard of them and I am not really convinced our goals would, at this point be completely aligned. Especially considering the fact that they have their own community to consider first and they have the ability to have a management and a performance fee on top. The 2/20 mentioned above.</p>
<p>I think perhaps we can reconsider in the future with a proposal to do this as an experiment. Such a proposal would be to not just mint oneGTC but also to fund a specific project that wants to be funded with oneGTC as opposed to GTC. With such a proposal the whole work of deciding who to fund with oneGTC and who with GTC would be taken off our hands which is good as that would mean less work. And any proposal should mention and have a commitment from the ICHI team to disable/not enable any fees on top.</p>

<p>People use money to either spend or save it - those who plan to spend it, would do so in both cases, but those who save, will now hold an asset that:</p>

<p>The vision is that at scale, people can do more stuff with $oneGTC - they can pay for contributors in the Gitcoin platform, donate to projects, create income service agreements bonds etc‚Ä¶</p>
<p>the more utility ‚Äî&gt; the less people immediately sell it cause they can use it and get benefits for prefering the protocol native stablecoin over others</p>
<p>In turn - the protocol can encourage people prefer it‚Äôs stable medium of exchange to pay for these kind of protocol service, cause it has the collateral generating yield that can potentially fund those rewards</p>

<li>The ICHI community will vote to launch only vetted projects with clear potential for a sustainable economy around their oneToken.</li>
<li>Whitelist strategies that has been vetted to be safe for deploying the collateral to work.</li>
<li>ICHI community has interest to ensure a responsible treasury management guidelines are followed, increase confidence in the oneToken, and supporting it‚Äôs growth</li>

<p>If those are kept - ICHI token holders share the fruits in the form of shared profits</p>
<p>With that said, we are at a very early stage. While all oneTokens have this structure built in, since v2 launch, this hasn‚Äôt been applied since the focus is on growth and adoption.</p>

<ul>
<li>won‚Äôt workstream contributors eventually redeem / sell the oneGTC for their various reasons? this seems counter to the claim i‚Äôve seen that oneGTC will prevent market selling. further, are workstreams actually interested in being paid in a token like this?</li>

            <p>Sorry to double post but I also feel that sometimes the more developer minded among us which I am for full disclosure still in the process of learning to become look down on the importance of price movement. I agree that this technology is revolutionary and groundbreaking and am personally working hard to learn more on the technical and theoretical side but lets be honest. We would as an entire crypto community be a lot less well off without the uneducated retail traders throwing millions of dollars at all the most recent hyped project. I think it would be silly to not put some emphasis on making a token people want to fomo into to as if we don‚Äôt we may be leaving a stream of revenue that could go toward the funding of public goods off the table. And almost more importantly be missing out on any future developers who would learn about gitcoin through such a hype cycle.</p>
<p>In conclusion dont let the principled stance of a technology first agenda get in the way of what will be best for the long term goal of funding public goods and paying developers</p>

            <p>I guess I dont really understand the negatives of this proposal. It really seems like a win win. Making more stable income stream for developers while ensuring more money gets trapped in the gitcoin community. I mean maybe the regulatory concerns mentioned above hold merit. I would like to know if this has ever been an issue with any other projects ichi worked on.</p>

            <p>Thanks for all who participated in the conversation we just had on the Gitcoin Stewards call !<br>
We deeply appreciate your engagement, challenges and questions.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd like to emphasize here for the wider voters community that might be concerned of focus / complexity / right timing - <strong>The ask to launch this experiment sum up to - Pay a round of workstream rewards in $oneGTC.</strong></p>
<p>That is why together with the steward we spent time deep diving into all the details, we think the potential value of a success is far greater than the risk taken.</p>
<p>Recipients will be able to decide if they want to hold $oneGTC and save with it, redeem it to $USDC or exchange it to $GTC.<br>
Then and with analysis of the experiment, the DAO can decide how to take it from there - proceed with more payments, expand for more use cases or wait.</p>
<p>Happy to answer here remaining questions we didn‚Äôt have the time to take on the call</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is a great point and may be ultimately what matters for this proposal. I‚Äôd still feel better if there was some small analysis done to make sure that regulators would likely see this similarly and that Gitcoin the company wouldn‚Äôt have issues further down the chain (e.g., if they need to approve the sending of $oneGTC from a multisig).</p>
<p>In terms of alternatives, have you seen the Uniswap KPI token idea? gov (dot) uniswap (dot) org/t/consensus-check-create-uniswap-volume-kpi-options-to-help-divest-uniswap-s-community-treasury-into-stablecoins/13533</p>

            <p>Do you have some alternatives that you‚Äôd like to propose ? That‚Äôs what this thread is for by all means. The community can make the decision on the best path to choose, but at the end of the day ICHI has stepped up to deliver this proposal as a collaboration with GitcoinDAO &amp; offering $100k of incentive rewards to build the stability of the treasury.</p>
<p>One thing I think that‚Äôs very important to differentiate is Gitcoin the company takes a certain stance on the value of the token, that‚Äôs all good an fine but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean the Gitcoin community has to take the same stance. The tokens an ERC-20 that is openly traded on Ethereum, we can do whatever we want with it and because the DAO is a non-legal entity.</p>
<p>I know the people who are relying on workstream payouts certainly won‚Äôt take the same stance around value.</p>
<p>In my opinion we need stable budgets for contributors to feel confident about their runway and how much time they can devote to working on fulfilling the DAO‚Äôs missions. This proposal moves us closer to that reality and so I stand by it.</p>

            <p>GTC is officially a governance token with no economic value as declared by the DAO on issuance and I believe it‚Äôs important from a legal perspective that that continues to be the stance. Sure it does trade on Uniswap, but this community can‚Äôt control that. I worry that formally creating a stablecoin that relies on the premise of a valuable GTC token could create regulatory complexity. Has this been evaluated by anyone? I haven‚Äôt seen anything in the post or comments addressing regulatory concerns.</p>
<p>I also haven‚Äôt seen alternatives discussed (e.g., Uniswaps KPI token idea).</p>
<p>Taking a step back, it may be better next step to firm up how this DAO conducts analysis (e.g., with something like yTeams at Yearn) on operational, legal, tax, technical, and other considerations before fairly specific proposals go to vote.</p>

            <p>Thanks for putting together the proposal. I really appreciate the sharing of ideas and ways to make Gitcoin better. I shared my thoughts on this in the prior <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-onegtc-a-stablecoin-for-the-gitcoin-community/6505/18">proposal discussion</a> but wanted to follow up here too.</p>
<p>I spent a lot more time thinking about this proposal given how many great people are involved and supporting this but I still don‚Äôt think it makes sense to create a separate stablecoin for Gitcoin at this stage. There are many other stablecoins that the community can use right now and it can become a potentially complicated, distracting process to make sure this is successful. If one of the objectives is to reduce market selling of GTC, then it might be worth also thinking through if there are other ways to achieve the same objective like staking. While I‚Äôm voting no on this proposal, I am fully supportive of experimentation if the community votes otherwise.</p>

            <p>This idea is sexy . I have been involved in several algo stablecoin like $OHM , $Float and $Rai . In my opinion , in addition to the mechanism, the usage scenario is also very important . I think we should discuss how to use $OneGTC . Of course , i think we can refer $Luna and $UST . In Luna‚Äôs economic system , people can mint $UST by mortgage $LUNA and can use $UST buy mirror‚Äôs synthetic assets.</p>

            <p>Q1: Is this a fork of Frax or Titan?<br>
A1: It is not a fork of FRAX or Titan.  Quite the opposite: Those projects promote fractionally reserve stablecoins at huge risk to depositors while ICHI‚Äôs model is the most over-collateralized model in the market.  It focuses on creating a horde of hodled crypto (ie, $GTC).  Every line of ICHI‚Äôs Decentralized Monetary Authority (DMA) code base is original and fully audited by Quantstamp + Solidified.  The DMA architecture is fully described at docs.ichi.farm</p>
<p>Q2: How does the 1:1 redemption mechanism work for USDC when GTC is in the mix? (Is there any documentation)<br>
A2: You redeem 1 $oneGTC for 1 $USDC (less redemption fee).  You can also swap at close to 1-for-1 on Uniswap V3.  It is that simple!  Nothing else like it.  That allows $USDC to function as a regulated off-ramp for $oneGTC.  If $oneGTC runs low on supplies of $USDC, it must rebalance on Uniswap V3 (or similar) to get more $USDC.  But this is always less than the amount of $GTC that would have otherwise been spent if using any other stablecoin or fiat asset.  Try it here with $one1INCH and $oneFIL: <a href="https://www.ichi.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.ichi.org/</a>. Read more here: doc.ichi.farm</p>
<p>Q3: I really like the concept of using oneGTC for grants, but how do we get the USDC needed for reserves?<br>
A3: It is up to the Gitcoin DAO but here are three ideas to mint $oneGTC while needing to sell very few $GTC:<br>
a) Reduce the amount of USDC needed to mint $oneGTC with loans to $oneGTC treasury.  There are two extremes: 1) no loan - this means 98+% USDC is needed at first and the minting ratio may only slowly decline as the treasury earns yields, 2) lend enough to maintain 600+% treasury reserve - this means minting ratio can be very close to 0% (ie, 5%)‚Ä¶ you only keep enough USDC around for short-term redemptions.  Anything in between enables minting ratios from 5% to 98%.  We set the initial proposal to allow an 80% minting ratio.<br>
b) Borrow.  You can set up $GTC and $oneGTC lending markets on platforms like wing.finance (an ICHI partner), Aave, and Compound.  Supply the $GTC and borrow $oneGTC or $USDC.<br>
c) Options.  There are option financing scenarios that involve no liquidation risk (unlike option b).<br>
IMO, the best thing to do is to start simply and get more fancy/complex with scale.</p>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/mame">@mame</a> , that‚Äôs a great point - this is why ICHI had just launched the first protocol provided liquidity function - The treasury is deploying ~10% of $USDC collateral to a trading pool on uniswap.  As the liquidity provider, it earns a 0.05% trading fee and further grow collateral.</p>

            <p>I read the document. I agree with the conclusion.</p>
<p>Can we specify in the Terms of Reference that projects that receive subsidies will use oneGTC without redeem?<br>
If they need more stable tokens (such as USDC), they should be reccomend to use Swap in the market.</p>
<p>If USDC is acquired through Redeem, collateral is reduced and GTC may be sold.<br>
one token is pegged overall, but if redeem becomes a common route, it will be unstable.<br>
We need to eliminate the temptation to get USDC by the redeem, and expand the utility.</p>
