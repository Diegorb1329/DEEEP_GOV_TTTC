GG20 Eligibility Criteria - Community Rounds
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-eligibility-criteria-community-rounds/17846
    In the proposed new structure, we will create a dedicated pool of funds (up to $125K quarterly) available to support ‚Äúmatching on matching‚Äù pools. Communities with any amount raised for matching and meeting the round criteria can apply for up to $25K in funding from Gitcoin to go toward their matching pool. The GG20 Community Council (a Gitcoin DAO-elected external council) will proceed to review applications and vote on which communities to fund in the upcoming round.

The below outlines the minimum viable criteria we have set for community rounds in the past (with a few added pieces). We want to hear from the community whether these criteria should be adjusted for GG20. Please review this post and drop your feedback in the comments. We will leave this open for comment until **February 20th**, thereafter making any relevant changes and ratifying it through a Snapshot vote.

## Eligibility Criteria for Community Rounds

#### TLDR: How to get a ‚ÄúCommunity‚Äù Round Approved

1. Identify the Round Operator and at least two other partner team members who will be reviewers and/or be involved in managing the round.

2. Every round must raise their own matching pool (no minimum)

3. The round should align with [Gitcoin‚Äôs Mission and Essential Intents](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/update-gitcoins-adopted-mission-and-vision-statements/15039)

4. All rounds must comply with Gitcoin's core rules, which include no fraudulent activity, [no quid pro quo](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-grants/general-questions/what-is-our-quid-pro-quo-policy), hate speech, or other activities out of alignment with Gitcoin's essential intents.

5. Show proof of funds in a multisig (similar to how anyone can view the funds in Gitcoin‚Äôs multisig)

* *We highly recommend that proof of matching funds and any further plans for funds raised by communities be provided by the time applications are in review. This will help council members review applications more easily.*

#### Before the Round

The 1-2 months leading up to the round require an intentional blitz and dedicated owners who can drive the responsibilities below forward. For smaller first-time rounds, all these may fall on the Round Owner if the round owner is operating in a near full-time capacity ‚Äì but generally, we recommend building out a small team to assist the round Operator as well as a small group of stakeholders from the community to be an Advisory Team of committed people to help generate ideas, gather feedback and provide support throughout the round.

**Round Eligibility Document**

A Round Owner should create an eligibility criteria doc for what projects qualify for acceptance.

While this can evolve if needed, the first version should be created before going out and fundraising and recruiting grantees so that it is clear to parties [what is eligible & what isn‚Äôt for the round.](https://roundoperations.gitcoin.co/round-operations/eligibility-and-review/eligibility-process)

The first-order mission-critical areas include:

* Allocating or otherwise raising funds for the matching pool
* Grantee recruitment & onboarding - (Runbooks will be made available with guidance for this process on the new Gitcoin Grants Stack tools)

Then, once a Community Round is approved into the round, the phases would be the following:

#### During the Round

Responsibilities include:

* Marketing the Round
* Supporting Grantees and Donors

#### After the Round

Responsibilities include:

* Overseeing the payouts and KYC process (if required) to ensure smooth facilitation and address questions or issues.
* Conducting a retrospective of the round to assess what worked and what can be improved and sharing feedback as appropriate with Gitcoin.
  * [Here‚Äôs a great example](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/retrospective-of-the-latam-round-and-next-steps-for-meta-pool-dao/16821) of a previous Community Round‚Äôs retrospective.
  * [Here‚Äôs a template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eAF-AjljTXaUS3hQOKxom7nNLrp6916cK4NtIaQV8co/edit?usp=sharing) for a retro.
* Matching funds must be released within 3 weeks. If not, will not be eligible for further matching or participation in GG rounds.
* Ongoing support and communications with Grantees are often required as the round concludes.

**REMINDER:** This is the minimum for a viable round. The Run Book provided to Round Operators will include much more information about how to run the best possible round.

## Community Round Partner Offerings - GG20

</aside>
<p>There is $125 K in matching on matching but what if the funds are not utilized through proposals ?<br>
It doesn‚Äôt make sense not to fund the smallest of matching pools if that would make a significant difference to the projects in those rounds. Despite their being small risk factors involved it may be worth exploring this option.</p>
<p>The stipulations to request matching funds shouldn‚Äôt have restrictions set in place that prevents accessibility to those who need it the most. Otherwise it is a pointless effort resulting in a snowballing effect of projects with money receiving more money who certainly don‚Äôt need it.</p>

            <p>It‚Äôs all good. The matching on matching would have been nice seeing as how the community rounds have to fend for themselves now going cold <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/cold_face.png?v=12" title=":cold_face:" class="emoji" alt=":cold_face:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> turkey <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/turkey.png?v=12" title=":turkey:" class="emoji" alt=":turkey:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> from having web3 &amp; community round matching pools of $200,000 in the previous round dropping down to nothing in season 20.</p>
<p>This will certainly leave a ton of people wondering what happened to the Gitcoin ecosystem between GG19 &amp; this round. As many teams and individuals have been preparing their grants for upcoming seasons based on the premise of these rounds happening in the past and may not have noticed the announcement <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/mega.png?v=12" title=":mega:" class="emoji" alt=":mega:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> via social networking channels about those rounds being community run. The fact that folks have to spin up their own community round for season 20 may catch a lot of people who had their hearts set on participating in their first Gitcoin round off guard.</p>
<p>It definitely feels like a lot of unnecessary barriers for folks who have less than 25K in matching funds.</p>
<p>Our intention is to fund a lot of amazing projects that have not had the opportunity to join the Superchain ecosystem utilizing the Gitcoin grants stack. Over the past week we have garnered the support of two dozen creators from all over the globe for our grants round in preparation for the application phase to open.</p>
<p>We have been raising funds since last year for our round and are also utilizing funding from rewards we received in the retroactive public goods funding round 3 to help fund our matching pool on Gitcoin.</p>
<p>It shouldn‚Äôt be so hard for people who are highly dedicated to building in the the public goods sector to receive assistance for sponsorship support with their little community rounds especially if it‚Äôs a small ask. The gesture of using funding from our own RPGF rewards already shows a high level of commitment to the grants program and our dedication to helping grow the pie larger. Why stifle that growth ?</p>

            <p>Oh that‚Äôs strange we missed that question sorry! But you can always DM me to check! Sometimes we miss questions on Twitter, but you can also use other channels to check on things (Discord, TG, DM‚Äôs). You could‚Äôve also asked us that on this gov forum post (as we also linked it during the space).</p>
<p>But if your applications are starting in a few days, you won‚Äôt be able to participate in GG20 anyway because the round is in April so it sounds like timing isn‚Äôt lining up.</p>

            <p>I‚Äôm not sure I understand. Are you saying that the reason you‚Äôre not eligible is that you cannot provide the list of team members in your proposal who will be round managers? If so, yeah I‚Äôd recommend reaching out to others in your community who might be interested in taking up the opportunity!</p>
<p>If it‚Äôs because you cannot edit the round to add round managers, then actually that is very possible to do through etherscan. We have a walkthrough for that <a href="https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/How-to-add-program-round-operators-21027a54bee54cea999d46f4059674e8?pvs=4" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a></p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/fractalvisions">@FractalVisions</a> as I expressed above - this isn‚Äôt GPNs forum, its gitcoins. GreenPill ran the training, these are you commenting on a Gitcoin forum post. Kevin didn‚Äôt run the training he was an instructor. I‚Äôm sorry that you wanted to get in the training but weren‚Äôt able to because you were trying to reach me/us in the wrong forum setting. For future reference ping us in our discord (GreenPill Network).</p>
<p>To say you were denied from the Cohort isn‚Äôt an accurate representation of what happened. To deny someone means we rejected them/turned them away - we did no such thing. Again though I am sorry you wanted to participate and were not able to. As mentioned and linked above, you can watch all the trainings on demand.</p>
<p>GreenPill Network doesn‚Äôt monitor the Gitcoin forum - the only reason I am here is because I got a notification because I was tagged. Otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt even know to look here at these comments.</p>
<p>For the future if you want to participate in something that GreenPill is running, and you feel you are missing out, it is best to hop into our discord and ask.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/fractalvisions">@FractalVisions</a> no one was denied from the training cohort, if you registered by the deadline and left an email you would have received an email with next steps. This training was run by The GreenPill Network, not gitcoin. We posted about it in Gitcoin‚Äôs forum - but Gitcoin‚Äôs forum isn‚Äôt the best place to reach us, as we are a separate group.</p>
<p>As well if you had flagged this to us, we could have manually added you - we had a number of people do this and they were given access to the charmverse page where we ‚Äòhoused‚Äô the trainings.</p>
<p>Everyone who registered was accepted, everyone who reached out was let in (unless they asked at the end in which by then most of the trainings were done since it was 8 weeks long)</p>
<p>In the meantime, we also turned it into an on-demand training on Gitcoins youtube - we felt it would reach more people here as that is where they look for round management resources over greenpill <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GitcoinOfficial/playlists?view=1&amp;sort=dd&amp;flow=grid" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.youtube.com/@GitcoinOfficial/playlists?view=1&amp;sort=dd&amp;flow=grid</a></p>

            <p>We were denied from the first cohort which left a bad taste in our mouth. In recent months leading up to the new year we have stopped spending ample amounts of time in governance forums, discord, and telegram channels as well. This is because the time spent developing our actual product with our developers and working on the code has become much more valuable and will provide more meaningful impact than the discourse of communication we have here. But also because prior to the Gitcoin Citizens round 2 there was a call to action for members to become more involved in governance and helping assist community members in the discord. Which didn‚Äôt get rewarded. So we are hesitant to spend any more of our precious time for work displaying our thoughts in text form.</p>
<p>Honestly the team is feeling highly discouraged to participate in the immediate Gitcoin ecosystem grants programs. It feels great to be running a round independently and we are thriving in the spirit of decentralization with Gitcoin grants stack technology at our fingertips. It‚Äôs nice to have your own freedom and not be bound by another overarching structure.</p>
<p>We will no longer be participating as grantees starting in GG20 because the amount of time/energy spent on a Gitcoin grant campaign was not meeting the benchmarks for our current fundraising goals so we have pursued funding from other programs in order to provide more room for newer young players in the web3 startup world of Gitcoin.</p>
<p>This is still a very crucial part of many web3 startups and our team has made it clear that the lift for each round was well beyond the rewards from the funding we received during grant rounds on Gitcoin during the year of 2023. Although the small amounts of funding we received during each round did help to subsidize a portion of costs for development. It‚Äôs time to move on.</p>
<p>We are happy to have made it to this stage of separation from the dependency of grant funding from Gitcoin. Thanks <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/pray.png?v=12" title=":pray:" class="emoji" alt=":pray:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> to Optimism and the rewards that we have received from the Retroactive Public Goods Funding we are able to complete the development of our MVP and fund our own grants program without any help.</p>

            <p>Appreciate the callout of Impact Assessment tools. As far as I can tell, hypercerts, GAP and Deresy are close to the Grants Stack and the Gitcoin ecosystem. I‚Äôd like to learn what the path to integrating these solutions as part of the required assessments for round operators.</p>
<p>For example, one could implement a flow similar to the Application Questions in the round creator and manager. When a field containing a GAP, Deresy or hypercerts reference is detected, a link is rendered to inspect the data. This would be the bare minimum but a cleaner UI around this would be more effective probably.</p>
<p>We experimented with hypercerts + grants stack for the GPN and outlined our findings here: <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/lessons-from-greenpill-networks-hypercerts-impact-funding-experiment/17257" class="inline-onebox">Lessons from GreenPill Network's Hypercerts Impact Funding Experiment</a></p>
<p>TLDR: how can we get these assessment into the Grants Apps?</p>

            <p>Thank you for your feedback! Everything that you point out would be needed, yes! Transparency around funding and who the round operators are, as well as accountability, are all already baked into the agreements as well as the questions outlined in the proposal.</p>
<p>As mentioned, we strongly recommend and provide guidance around how sybil resistance is done within the rounds. Historically, we have not come across any issues doing it this way. If we encounter an issue, we can look at amending this in the future. And because all round have to comply to our core rules, which includes no fraudulent activity, this also ensures that round comply to sybil resistance measures throughout.</p>

            <p>Some more points I think would be good to consider;</p>
<p>Rounds should maintain the same sybil resistance measures as the core round. (really essential I think)</p>
<p>There should be more transparency around grantees addresses and the community rounds own funding.</p>
<p>It should be made clear who the round stewards are.</p>
<p>Lobbying round stewards in private should not be allowed - communications must be open and transparent.</p>
<p>There needs to be more accountability around ensuring that eligibility criteria are adhered to.</p>

            <p>I‚Äôm not actually sure I know what you mean. But the way it‚Äôs being set up and something that‚Äôs part of the agreements is that application and donation timelines of community rounds match up with OSS. And that‚Äôs why eligibility criteria for each round is so vital. That‚Äôs the criteria for accepting/rejecting grantees.</p>

            <p>I think there could be also a possibility that round operators will cheat by only accepting projects within a very short time span.</p>
<p>For example, alert their friends that ‚Äúwe will apply at 2pm, you only got 1 hour.‚Äù Hence, rationale for other projects to be excluded is ready.</p>
<p>Plus, I am absolutely against any interviews or any additional requirements on behalf of the applicants.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Eligible Passport Score for matching:</strong> Should the community rounds default to the same thresholds as Core Round (e.g., Matching power will proportionally increase for scores between 15 and 25)? If not, there should be a mandatory minimum threshold for Passport Score (say, 15) for matching for a Community Round to be eligible.</p>

<p>Up until now we have provided best practices and have resources like the Runbook that we can point them to. We believe it should still remain the community‚Äôs decision what they‚Äôd prefer to do here, as it might be restricting for community rounds.</p>
<p>It goes into your following point as well. Seeing that the rounds have been relatively small, we haven‚Äôt seen a problem with them handling sybil squelching themselves. There are areas where we may think about getting help from more qualified community members to offer support and guidance as well in the future. We will offer guidance and advice on using collusion-resistant QF because I agree it‚Äôs a very strong mechanism and it works well.</p>

<p>Love these ideas! What we can do is add it to the propsal template to give communities applying the opportunity to express if and how they are planning on assessing grantee impact.</p>
<p>I will also amend the eligibility the reflect that round operators should provide feedback on rejections/approvals as that‚Äôs a very important point!</p>
<p>And of course, no matter what, teams may always be in touch with Ecosystem Collective as well as the Grants Lab grants ops team and we will provide best effort support.</p>
