    I am sure you would agree with me here that currently gaming in the web3 is way way below the actual gaming experience Games not only can  have a huge impact financially  in the web3 space but it can be the biggest source of web3 adaption and growing the community. I know there is a lot of work happening in games like p2e , wolfgame etc but I am talking abt ROBLOX, MINECRAFT, Clash Of Clans, Fortnite. if we could just create a link between the web3 and these which our every 5 year old who plays Roblox would be part of the community. 

Being a gamer and a game developer I believe this is something we should be actively looking in to.

Web3 and how games can act as a major catalyst for growing the community!
FractalVisions

            <p>I totally agree after experiencing a Blockchain game on the optimism networks last year called OP craft.<br>
We were able to test the net work, which is now the main net work on optimism‚Ä¶<br>
It was an amazing experience, and should set the standard for the industry, especially if a lot of companies and developers are using the OP stack technology to build their Blockchain on top of and develop their dapps‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Having a way to track a participants information on chain in a visual map representation, and looking at the behavior of the users in the game is always the most interesting part after the fact‚Ä¶</p>
<p>We plan on expanding our own version of this virtual world, which is essentially a Minecraft game on a Blockchain server‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Also, having the ability to create custom and complex smart contracts to alter gameplay and enhance the user experience has come to fruition with this game that I was a part of on optimism last October in 2023.</p>
<p>We had two weeks to build on the test that and then in the middle of the experience, they announced 30,000 OP tokens were being given away for certain categories‚Ä¶</p>
<p>During this time, someone took over the land in the center of the spawning zone, and we had to sign a treaty with the alliance through a smart contract to gain possession of our land back, but the good thing is we also gained unlimited resources by doing so in agreement to build a amazing utopia together.!</p>
<p>People would take your land and you could take it back if you worked hard enough, so it was a very free environment and was the first time that I felt like I was in a truly autonomous and decentralized world with no rules other than smart contracts‚Ä¶</p>
<p>We won 1000 op tokens for the educational category.</p>
<p>Here is a link to the thread about our experience‚Ä¶</p>
