[Gitcoin's Purpose - ratified June 2022]

Brief contextâ€¦
---

A few months ago, we proposed a new Vision statement and Mission statement to inform the brief for our brand visual refresh. Further discussion was had in the forum and in conversations with members of CSDO to work towards ratifying statements we can all align with and work from.

You can read ongoing discussions on the topic in:

* The original post on Mission and Vision [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-series-evolving-the-gitcoin-brand-mission-vision-values/12255),
* The Brand Strategy work [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-series-evolving-the-gitcoin-brand-introduction-overview/12164)
* A post (+ poll) that aimed to align the DAO on a final ratified mission and vision statements [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-poll-aligning-on-gitcoins-mission-vision/13639)

These ratified statements are meant to serve as part of a framework and tools that give us a clear sense of direction and complement our already [ratified purpose](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/update-gitcoindaos-adopted-purpose-and-essential-intents/10984), which will remain the same. Our Mission and Vision statements will inform how we align and make decisions together while also being communicated to the wider community and public to add color to why we exist.

Our processâ€¦

In a [poll](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-poll-aligning-on-gitcoins-mission-vision/13639) made late March on proposed mission and vision statements, 58% of participants agreed that it was safe to move forward with the concepts held in following statements:

[Initially Proposed] Vision: Gitcoin inspires people to imagine alternate futures, advancing a world shaped by community led positive change.

[Initially Proposed] Mission: Gitcoin creates tools that enable communities to build, fund and protect what matters to them.

To do a final wordsmith of these statements, we incorporated feedback from the comments following the [original post](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-series-evolving-the-gitcoin-brand-mission-vision-values/12255) on mission and vision work, the comments the [alignment poll](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-poll-aligning-on-gitcoins-mission-vision/13639) and from feedback from individual members of CSDO to finalize and ratify the following statements in a CSDO strategy call on May 12, 2023:

Vision: Gitcoin inspires a world shaped by community-led positive change

Mission: Gitcoin creates technologies and opportunities that enable communities to build, fund and protect what matters

Final thoughtsâ€¦

Things are changing fast here at Gitcoin! As we grow, we know the essential work will change with it. With that said, we hope the statements provide all contributors, community members and champions of Gitcoin a clear sense of the direction weâ€™re all building toward.
