    Gm

Since our announcement of Shell‚Äôs involvement with Gitcoin Grants we have been listening to the community sentiment and thinking through how to respond with meaningful action vs. performative words.

When GitcoinDAO launched in 2021, we began a journey of decentralization which has not come without its challenges. Decision-making processes were put in place and iterated on as we moved from operating as an impact org to a protocol focused one. This required us to both move fast and take our passionate community along for the ride.

With our intention of staying neutral, we worked to maintain Gitcoin Grants, ship products that are useful to us and other communities and created plans to achieve financial sustainability for the DAO. All of this resulted in a series of decisions that our community did not have a chance to weigh in on.

I believe taking money from Shell, on our terms, was the right decision. Lending our legitimacy to them and calling them partners and showcasing them may not have been the right decision without more feedback from our community.

As a DAO and a respected brand in the Ethereum ecosystem, we understand the importance of working in public and the necessity of community involvement. Another beautiful thing about our ecosystem is that many ideals can co exist in our ecosystem and, in fact, very much co-exist in the Gitcoin community.

We wanted to ensure that our decision to accept funding from Shell was not something that we forced all grantees to accept however. As a result, grantees were asked to opt in during their application process. They can decide!

That said, we understand our responsibility in who and how we promote activities happening on our tech (we learned this loud and clear last round). We know that for some of you, running rounds where Shell is involved is not really the problem...but giving them a stage to amplify their voice is.

We acknowledge that our missteps have ripple effects and we are working to improve how we approach better community decision making. We‚Äôre listening and would like to invite everyone to participate in the development of a process that supports the selection and promotion of partners who feel aligned with our community‚Äôs values moving forward. See @ceresstation‚Äôs post on [Gitcoin Partnerships Council](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gcp-xxx-gitcoin-partnerships-council/16274) to engage in the conversation.

I hope we can continue to show you our progress as we grow together as a community and a DAO.

<p>i hope i‚Äôm not going to make people upset or uncomfortable with this, but it‚Äôs really just part of the global system to control resources. they want to add ‚Äúcarbon scores‚Äù to our credit cards, which will be easy enough once they switch it to CBDC (we‚Äôll still use the same cards, most people won‚Äôt notice a difference at all.) it‚Äôs already started with corporations, but individuals are coming soon, if we don‚Äôt stand up against it.</p>

<p>And Shell are laughing, folks. That‚Äôs the thing. That‚Äôs their strategy. Well honed for well over a 100 years. Split communities who want to see change, and entice with a couple of greenbacks.Half a mil? Bah, it‚Äôs a drop in the ocean, one of their many polluting ones.</p>
<p>I guess it really depends on how deep your own research has gone. Some food for thought for 2023 - freebies abound.

<p>So that‚Äôs 37, 500, 000, 000 euros per year from tax payers money in a country of just under 18 million. Now we know were that 500, 000 might have come from. I wonder what the bounty pay is for the Shell employee that‚Äôs keeping track on this thread.</p>

A comment on the Shell X Gitcoin Partnership
dddao

            <p>Dear Gitcoin Team and Community,</p>
<p>We at <a href="https://gainforest.earth" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GainForest</a> have always appreciated Gitcoin‚Äôs dedication to supporting a decentralized, open-source ecosystem. However, we feel compelled to address a concern we have regarding Gitcoin‚Äôs recent association with Shell, specifically its inclusion in the Gitcoin <em>climate</em> matching pool.</p>
<p>Our team has been active in climate policy advocacy at both national and international levels. We‚Äôve witnessed first-hand the role that Big Oil corporations like Shell play in stalling progress on climate action. Furthermore, Shell‚Äôs past conduct, which includes legal controversies related to environmental degradation and human rights violations, presents an ethical quandary.</p>
<h4><a name="historical-accountability-1" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#historical-accountability-1"></a>Historical Accountability</h4>
<p>Shell, among other Big Oil companies, bears significant responsibility for the ongoing climate crisis. Even more alarming is their historic record, including legal controversies such as their complicity in human rights abuses on environmentalists (<a href="https://earthrights.org/case/wiwa-v-royal-dutch-shell/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Wiwa v. Royal Dutch Shell</a>).</p>

<h4><a name="recent-activities-and-greenwashing-2" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#recent-activities-and-greenwashing-2"></a>Recent Activities and Greenwashing</h4>
<p>Recent actions by Shell have only reinforced our concerns. Despite public commitments to sustainability, they have used their unprecedented profits to double down on fossil fuel exploration and extraction. This, in our view, represents a strategy of greenwashing rather than genuine change, as outlined in Al Gore‚Äôs <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/al_gore_what_the_fossil_fuel_industry_doesn_t_want_you_to_know?language=en" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">TED talk</a> and Christiana Figueres‚Äô <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2023/7/6/i-thought-fossil-fuel-firms-could-change-i-was-wrong" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Al Jazeera article</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="funding-priorities-3" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#funding-priorities-3"></a>Funding Priorities</h4>
<p>We understand the challenge of securing consistent, long-term funding for environmental initiatives. That said, the acceptance of Shell‚Äôs contribution to the Gitcoin climate matching pool ‚Äî irrespective of its size ‚Äî lends the corporation unwarranted legitimacy and reputational influence over projects genuinely seeking to address climate issues. We believe this might hurt projects in the long-term and is against the interest of Gitcoin.</p>
<h4><a name="our-stance-4" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#our-stance-4"></a>Our Stance</h4>
<p>GainForest has opted out of Shell funding and we‚Äôve elaborated on our reasoning in our <a href="https://blog.gainforest.earth/gitcoin-shell" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">blog post</a>. We acknowledge that not all organizations have the luxury to make this choice, but we believe Gitcoin should consider prioritizing long-term ethical funding over short-term gains.</p>
<p>We urge Gitcoin to reassess its funding sources, especially as we find ourselves at a crucial juncture in the battle against climate change. Our choices today will undeniably shape our collective future, and it‚Äôs imperative that we make decisions aligned with the long-term well-being of our planet instead of short-term profit.</p>

            <p>As a grantee in open source and web3 social round I can not really have a position on shell funding.<br>
However, I strongly believe from now on Gitcoin is associated with Greenwashing.</p>
<p>I think Gitcoin has opened a Pandora box. And now we can expect all kinds of sponsors. I would not be surprised if we get an announcement that a dictator has personally invested into a matching pool.</p>
<p>I think Mars has really good points. Here is further information from the linked article.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shell appears to have been the most prominent employer of influencer advertising over the last seven years.</p>
<p>In April, for example, the fossil fuel giant released a five-part YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WzCVFno9yA&amp;t=1s&amp;ab_channel=Shell" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">series</a> hosted by ex-BBC presenter Dallas Campbell, which touted the net zero benefits of hydrogen and featured one-on-one interviews with two Shell executives.</p>
<p>Oil and gas companies have been heavily promoting hydrogen as a green fuel, despite the UN‚Äôs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change <a href="https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6wg3/pdf/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FinalDraft_FullReport.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">estimating</a> that hydrogen will represent at best 2.1 percent of total energy consumption in 2050.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShell has the ambition to make enough hydrogen from renewable power to kick-start this energy revolution,‚Äù Campbell said in the first video of the series, which has gained nearly 30,000 views.</p>
<p>The former BBC presenter has also promoted the series on his personal social media channels. On <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CrT89f2g-we/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Instagram</a>, Campbell encouraged his followers to watch his ‚ÄúHydrogen powered adventure!‚Äù but did not tag Shell, nor mention his commercial relationship with the brand.</p>
<p>This was also not the first time that Campbell had partnered with Shell. In 2016, he <a href="https://archive.is/wip/6wnLr" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">presented</a> the social media coverage of the company‚Äôs Make the Future London festival. ‚ÄúDallas was fantastic,‚Äù Shell said in a <a href="https://archive.is/wip/SmktI" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">testimonial</a> following the event, adding that the social media campaign had fetched over a million views, which the company described as ‚Äúabsolutely huge!‚Äù</p>
<p>In 2022, a Harvard University <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/static/planet4-netherlands-stateless/2022/09/0ded952d-threeshadesofgreenwashing.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">paper</a> found that a ‚Äúgreen innovation‚Äù narrative was one of the key social media tactics deployed by fossil fuel companies. Analysing 2,325 social media posts from 22 major European polluters, the report found that 72 percent of posts from oil and gas firms tried to emphasise their spending on green technology.</p>
<p>As the study also pointed out, however, these firms invested just 1.7 percent of their annual capital expenditures in low carbon technologies between 2010 and 2018.</p>

            <p>Your clarifications regarding Shell‚Äôs terms to participate in the matching pool would be important to know in full. Does the conversation just end like this?</p>

            <p>Dear community, I find it very refreshing to read the apologies for greenwashing Shell, and people‚Äôs responses through this Governance platform. Representing an Arab youth climate grassroots that tried applying to GR15 unsuccessfully, only to finally make it to GR18 and find myself in front of such a question: I echo the criticisms laid forth that this decision should have been done much more transparently and democratically.</p>
<p>As first-timer with no computational experience, my team and I are wondering if it is worth it for us to officially accept money from Lebanon‚Äôs own Shell CEO, Wael Sawan, if we are not being able to convince the environmentalist community to create a Passport and fund us, nor are we being able to penetrate the sexist and homophobic crypto-community here. So they would take credit and use our logo only to match the $15 we have been able to collect so far, or whatever little amount we manage to get by?</p>
<p>This feels super wrong, and thus, we kindly ask every one of you to please explore our ‚ÄúFFF Lebanon: Pan-Arab DeFi solidarity‚Äù climate solution grant to see how we are facing the fossil industry at the very frontlines of ecological breakdown; and donate for us to make Wael start paying up for loss and damages starting at home, putting our leg up on this corporate mistake to further pressure them and TotalEnergies and ENI and NovaTek and anyone else with fossil interests to keep exploring and drilling new wells, as if nothing they could be held accountable for were happening, and even being promoted at this UNFCCC‚Äôs COP28.</p>
<p>FFF Europe had started a campaign for insurers and bankers of the fossil industry to spend $1 in Climate Finance for every $1 these fossil companies spend. Now, this is the scale of financing youth-collectives need. Anything less is really considered a mockery, but if we do find this economic and political means of campaigning to be massively advantageous for us in countering the rampantly racist, sexist, homophobic and transphobic systems ruling over our SWANA region through authoritarian sectarianism ‚Äì then so be it, we will not drop out of this pool of funds.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I don‚Äôt agree with those who say ‚Äúmoney is money‚Äù (in sweeter words).<br>
Brand damage is real, most of your supporters here are typically anti supercapitalism and on the opposity side of Shell. It‚Äôs not too late to save face, kick Shell and the likes out or lose your community.<br>
Simple as that.</p>
<p>Stop acting like you are wallstreet businessmen with difficult moral decisions, you already chose a side by working for Gitcoin.<br>
Stay on your side.<br>
Options like this shouldn‚Äôt even be considered.</p>
<p>You are building  pure love with Gitcoin passport and the Public goods network.<br>
Don‚Äôt you see you are souring it?</p>

            <p>Just want to say that I‚Äôm a Gitcoin maxi - this event does nothing to lessen that.  I also think your decision to take Shell funds is not wrong.  How Gitcoin associates its brand with Shell is of course a legitimate concern.  I was in the nonprofit sector for 15 years and received funds from a number of foundations who received THEIR funds from individuals, institutions and companies that people would consider ‚Äòdirty.‚Äô  Yet, the veneer of an intermediate nice sounding nonprofit made it palatable for almost everyone.</p>
<p>I think Gitcoin has a responsibility to secure as much funding as possible to fund the radicle and pragmatic projects utilizing its platform for building a better world.  We need billions of it in fact and as soon as possible.  I think it would be interesting to have a discussion around what money Gitcoin takes and what money it doesn‚Äôt - but that is the rabbit hole of rabbit holes.</p>
<p>It pains me to see Gitcoin get so beat up on this but it is part of the game though when you are a top of funnel organization for funding public goods.  Thanks for being the ones making mistakes and help making dreams happen - in public, in reflection and in service to a better world.</p>

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle">@kyle</a> thanks for opening the discussion here.</p>
<p>From reading the thread on a <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gcp-xxx-gitcoin-partnerships-council/16274">partner vetting policy</a>, it seems many people would have appreciated a simple poll that could have served as a community temperature check. You‚Äôll see <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/umarkhaneth">@umarkhaneth</a>‚Äôs thread proving so <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gcp-xxx-gitcoin-partnerships-council/16274/25">here</a>.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/shawn16400">@shawn16400</a> critically pointed out that Gitcoin does not need another council. Instead, we should lean more heavily on our current steward council <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/annika">@annika</a> also shared this sentiment of engaging the stewards more, while highlighting the information overload that can be intimidating for community members.</p>
<p>I personally found the suggestion from <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/essemharris">@essemharris</a> quite interesting. Here it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>TL;dr</strong>: We should design a GCP that formalizes (1) when the Stewards Council can intervene in a partnership opportunity, (2) the nature of that intervention, and (3) how, if at all, the partner or the Gitcoin Foundation can appeal the Steward Council‚Äôs decision. This GCP design should begin immediately after the partnership development process made transparent to the community.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also appreciate the merit and rationale behind the comment from <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/rohit">@rohit</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Whether it is Lahaina in Hawaii or Shimla in the Himalayas, when nature strikes its fury, it doesn‚Äôt discriminate based on what beliefs we hold dear. [‚Ä¶] As someone who has nothing to do with the Climate round, I might hold my opinion dear on the trail of bad blood in the money going in the pool, but it shouldn‚Äôt count as much as, say, a grantee from the Global South fighting for the next dollar that can go a long way in making a difference in their world. Alternatively, if the grantee community believes their rounds are better off without similar alliances, the DAO should honor that as a signal in future partnerships.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this makes a good point. It reminds me of when soya farmers made the news for the deforestation of the Amazon and how terrible that was. The reality is how can you care about the future of the world when tomorrow isn‚Äôt guaranteed? These people don‚Äôt care about deforestation more than they care about feeding their families.</p>
<p>This brings me to a point made by <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/connor">@connor</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>At the end of the day, it‚Äôs become extremely hard to raise matching pool funds in this bear market, and much of the loud criticism is coming from people who have benefited immensely from matching pool funds over the years.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can‚Äôt believe the variety of nationalities and cultures represented on the GG18 kick-off call. The same goes for the weekly community calls ‚Äì it is really awe-inspiring how many people have felt support from Gitcoin. Keeping them resourced seems like a worthy cause to me, but I‚Äôm interested to hear more about what we value as a community. Are we saving the Amazon or feeding our family?</p>
<p>Can we do both?</p>

<p>Since our announcement of Shell‚Äôs involvement with Gitcoin Grants we have been listening to the community sentiment and thinking through how to respond with meaningful action vs. performative words.</p>
<p>When GitcoinDAO launched in 2021, we began a journey of decentralization which has not come without its challenges. Decision-making processes were put in place and iterated on as we moved from operating as an impact org to a protocol focused one. This required us to both move fast and take our passionate community along for the ride.</p>
<p>With our intention of staying neutral, we worked to maintain Gitcoin Grants, ship products that are useful to us and other communities and created plans to achieve financial sustainability for the DAO. All of this resulted in a series of decisions that our community did not have a chance to weigh in on.</p>
<p>I believe taking money from Shell, on our terms, was the right decision. Lending our legitimacy to them and calling them partners and showcasing them may not have been the right decision without more feedback from our community.</p>
<p>As a DAO and a respected brand in the Ethereum ecosystem, we understand the importance of working in public and the necessity of community involvement. Another beautiful thing about our ecosystem is that many ideals can co exist in our ecosystem and, in fact, very much co-exist in the Gitcoin community.</p>
<p>We wanted to ensure that our decision to accept funding from Shell was not something that we forced all grantees to accept however. As a result, grantees were asked to opt in during their application process. They can decide!</p>
<p>That said, we understand our responsibility in who and how we promote activities happening on our tech (we learned this loud and clear last round). We know that for some of you, running rounds where Shell is involved is not really the problem‚Ä¶but giving them a stage to amplify their voice is.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that our missteps have ripple effects and we are working to improve how we approach better community decision making. We‚Äôre listening and would like to invite everyone to participate in the development of a process that supports the selection and promotion of partners who feel aligned with our community‚Äôs values moving forward. See <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ceresstation">@ceresstation</a>‚Äôs post on <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gcp-xxx-gitcoin-partnerships-council/16274">Gitcoin Partnerships Council</a> to engage in the conversation.</p>
<p>I hope we can continue to show you our progress as we grow together as a community and a DAO.</p>
