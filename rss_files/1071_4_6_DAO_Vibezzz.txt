# 4/6 DAO Vibezzz

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV07OwrKfjM

Apologies to some of our members the audio did not record all voices :( . We are trying to get this resolved for the next session. 

### Loie: What is the role or duty of an organization to help parents with childcare?

- Anuj: Interesting conversation in today‚Äôs public goods library (11 AM EST right before DAO Vibes in Discord!) and Lani probably has thoughts
    - Book of Essays from this talk: [https://www.amazon.ca/Education-Time-Between-Worlds-Technology/dp/0986282677](https://www.amazon.ca/Education-Time-Between-Worlds-Technology/dp/0986282677)
- Lani: Super interesting project looking at how to build local nooks/protocols to experiment with governance and parenting. Parents work in a coworking cafe where their kids can also play/learn together
    - Parents Nook on Twitter : [https://twitter.com/Parents_Nook](https://twitter.com/Parents_Nook)
- Loie: Trying to develop a parental leave society. Need to expand the thought that you should get social support not just from your employer but from your community. Thinking about how we can make a model for the ecosystem. Could create matching for projects providing social support by the ecosystem ‚Äî Ethereum as a nation.
- Annika: Very grateful to be here and as someone soon to be a parent it feels great that people are thinking about this
- Owocki: +1 this is super important to be an attractive place to work
- Owocki: 20 somethings in the audience may not care about childcare now but they will as they and the ecosystem mature. Have worked in startups from 22 to now, 37
- Loie: What was the environment like when you were at a startup early on?
- Owocki: Long working hours would not have allowed for childcare
- Loie: We all have times in our lives when we need to take a step back and still deserve to have our needs met. It‚Äôs okay to take time off from work. There will be a place to resume your role. Lots of benefits to both contributor and project. Wanting to talk to Lani who has ideas about DAO basic income.
- Lani: It‚Äôs about building a culture of care, from the ground up within an organization. There‚Äôs so much love here in Gitcoin. We get to ask these really fundamental questions about what‚Äôs the purpose of DAO and what are intentions beyond financial sustainability? How do DAOs function as a post-nationstate entity? If everything could flow through local, contributors
- Gloria: So important to be able to feel like you can step back and take time for other priorities.  She takes care of her kids and aging parents and sometimes needs to be able to take the time to focus on them and herself. Eat that frog !
    - [https://www.amazon.com/Eat-That-Frog-Great-Procrastinating/dp/162656941X](https://www.amazon.com/Eat-That-Frog-Great-Procrastinating/dp/162656941X)

### Loie: Was living in hometown for a while. It feels like there‚Äôs no overlap between her web3 life and IRL life. Been in Europe for the last few weeks and the long days feel a lot easier in a communal hacker house. When the water heater broke, one of her housemates/colleagues offered to stay up and boil water for her ‚Äî really touching.

- Sameer: Sounds like the difference between a company and a community. Can really see the benefits of being in a community. There can also be some bad parts to it
- Colton: And in these visiting scenarios you always have the option to leave. In the art space, there are NFT spaces that don‚Äôt have any IRL spaces. More and more of a need and a want for IRL places. Missing college‚Äôs ‚Äòwork hard, play hard‚Äô style and when the lines blur between colleague and family.
- Gloria: Would be great to have a multi-generational aspect to it. Like a space for kids to engage and be a part of things. A real-life space for parents and kids
- Armando: Maybe Gitcoin could have drop-in houses
- Seanmac: Or tag along with an existing one, have a partnership
- Lani: Definitely hit it on the head with the college feeling. Something powerful, and magical about being in person. Creating an Ethos throughout the organization of caring for people
- Gloria: DevCon in Bogota ‚Äî might bring her kids :)
- Anuj: Loie, how did that kindness touch you, how would you pay forward the person who stayed up to get you hot water?
- Loie: It‚Äôs nice to extend similar kindness to others. She feeds people healthy meals and started a sauna
- Anuj: Community of care is so amazing. Has been experimenting with a group of people in Canada who brainstorm and do art based on crypto
- Colton: I feel like we all want to pack up and move into a hacker house now
- Anuj: Has a space for people like this ‚Äî  [https://twitter.com/KindePayNFT?s=20&t=sCZoaaZ1uxXXHrT2Wo_YQQ](https://twitter.com/KindePayNFT?s=20&t=sCZoaaZ1uxXXHrT2Wo_YQQ)
    - A place where people come together to think about kindness and create art
- Loie: Favorite song ‚ÄúAll is full of love‚Äú which goes something like ‚Äúyou‚Äôll be given love. you‚Äôll be taken care of. it's all around you‚Äù by Bjork
    - [https://youtube.com/watch?v=wxBO28j3vug](https://youtube.com/watch?v=wxBO28j3vug)
- Colton: intellectually warm to talk about love but feels so much nicer in person
- Sameer: helping people makes me more receptive to being helped
- Colton: Let‚Äôs spread these vibes to the rest of Web3. Irl experiences really change hearts and minds
- Seanmac: Give And Take by Adam Grant changed his perspective and made him realize he used to be so giving but the corporate world took it from him. This book brought him back. Link: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CAUH7UE/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CAUH7UE/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)
- Garysheng: This book is about unlearning pathological mindsets. Gitcoin embodies the giving spirit. Sparking upward spirals. Giving feedback loops.
- Sameer: Kindness is a network effect that builds with more participants
- Lani: Evolving away from profit-centered motive and toward something ephemeral. Thank you Anuj for sharing a beautiful project
- Anuj: Kindness is about finding value in unexpected places
- Armando: Believes everything will enumerated in the end and in the power of RPGF
- Nano: Feels like he‚Äôs getting the vibe and message of gitcoin today. As an artist, struggling to make money. Now feels like he doesn‚Äôt have to do meaningless work that he hates. Wants to spread the word around about gitcoin. Got into Gitcoin by reading and talking to people, been involved with Memepalooza. Felt like he was being corrected and judged by society. But in Web3 he feels like he can be himself
- Umar: Lots of people can resonate with that feeling of being judged by society. Feels like this is a space where you‚Äôre encouraged to bring your whole identity.

### Umar: How can I help create a community of care for coworkers who have kids?

- Lani: Awareness and Compassion are a beautiful place to begin
- Gloria: Just being aware that in any moment someone might need something from me. Giving people extra wiggle room to respond or recording calls. Also, especially IRL, being okay with play. Kids are very playful. Also being aware that people are multifaceted, not just parents.
- Armando: Glad to hear the words ‚Äòlove‚Äô and ‚Äòcare‚Äô. These are values that men aren‚Äôt always encouraged to talk about but they are important values and I‚Äôm glad they are discussed in the open in Web3
- Loie: when she sees kids in the video call, usually feels like the parent has an auto reaction that their kids shouldn‚Äôt be in the frame. her response is to welcome the little moment of participation from the kids. Wave and say hello üôÇ
- Gloria: Take your kid to work day would be really cool. Her son is bubbly and likes talking to people. Remembers a call when her kid was trying to talk to Kyle‚Äôs kid while her and Kyle were having a meeting. They had to throw in the towel and let their kids talk. Having the space to reschedule the meeting without being stressed was really great
- Lani + Sean: Maybe we need a side room for kids in zoom
- Loie: It‚Äôs not disrespectful to eat in meetings or have kids in meetings. It‚Äôs part of being human and we should bring that to work
- Nanopunk: Kids were welcomed in recording studios. Now, welcomes kids to podcast making them aware of violence against women. Loves having kids in the spce

### David: All this talk of warming water reminds me of an old buddhist saying. A young grasshopper asks a senior guru ‚Äúhow do I become enlightened?‚Äù. The guru says ‚Äúcarry water and chop wood.‚Äù After 20 years, the grasshopper comes back and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been carrying water and chopping wood for 20 years. Now what do I do?‚Äù and the guru says ‚Äúcarry water and chop wood.‚Äù

- No matter how we change through life, those base chores remain the same. It turns out it‚Äôs how we do things not what we do that really matters.
