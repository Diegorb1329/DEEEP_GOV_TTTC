    To the Web3 Farsi-speaking community:

[We see you](https://twitter.com/annbrody7/status/1468737168294256644).  We hear you.  I wish we could help.

For those of you of Iranian heritage or based in Iran - your government and our gov don‚Äôt get along.  That's not your fault as individuals.  That doesn‚Äôt mean that you don‚Äôt deserve human thriving.

But it does mean that Gitcoin Core, or any US based entity, is legally prohibited from allowing your grant to be live on our platform.  If your project is not at risk of violating sanctions, then please [educate us](mailto:support@gitcoin.co) with supporting documentation. If that's not feasible,  I understand your frustration with Gitcoin & that you have to move on.. 

Our vision is to [build & fund digital public goods](https://gitcoin.co) to a diverse global community, and last week our vision collided with reality & [we came up short](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/when-we-come-up-short/9378/3).  We are extremely saddened by this situation and the effects it has on you, the community we set out to serve.  I hope that we continue to engage on this matter,  and I welcome your feedback & comments below. 

In gratitude,
@owocki

            <p>To provide an update here, due to lack of legal clarity (and funding) on this subject, a group of people from devon VI created a few initiatives, such as one to fund legal scholars to create a guideline around web3 and Iranian users, especially after the new US treasury announcements that allows almost all free (‚Äúno-fee‚Äù) services and any projects regarding Internet Freedom to be allowed to service Iranians. The output will be open and freely available to all projects and any input from their legal team will be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Thanks for calling this out <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/pray.png?v=12" title=":pray:" class="emoji" alt=":pray:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>There is currently a live vote on what to do with Season 16. It looks as though the next open round will be held in January '23. This will be on the protocol.</p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>The protocol is a decentralized backend and set of smart contracts which can run a grants round end to end. Ideally, even if Gitcoin did not allow a grant, another org could fork the protocol, UI, and community.</p>
<p>In reality, the beta and alpha launches will still run the final calculations of a round in a centralized way. Additionally, the ability to censor grants, while not possible on the protocol, is an option on the UI. Therefore, Gitcoin and any other org hosting a UI, will be responsible for making the decision as to how much <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/05/09/control_as_liability.html">liability they own via control</a> AND the limits of how much potential liability they are willing to accept.</p>
<p>Seeing how the next round won‚Äôt be until January, and the protocol transition work is mid-flight, I don‚Äôt think we will be able to answer this until more pieces of the protocol are set.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll also tag <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle">@kyle</a> <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kevin.olsen">@kevin.olsen</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/nategosselin">@nategosselin</a> to the conversation.</p>

<p>But you bring up even an even more important update! The US connection has greatly decreased recently! Maybe we can be more inclusive!</p>
<p>Can the DAO allow grants from anywhere, irrelevant of the fear that  some overbearing nation state drums up?</p>
<p>Who are the people in the DAO is relevant to discuss these issues? Anyone know?<br>

            <p>This is huge indeed.</p>
<p>I was hoping to get some updates from Gitcoin or see an initiative regarding opening up this discussion. Specially the fact that the suspended users here are Iranian women working on educational material that can save millions of people from oppression.</p>
<p>We should do better than web2 not worst. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/frowning.png?v=12" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<hr>
<p>For context:</p>
<p>Last week Iran‚Äôs ‚Äúmorality police‚Äù which is <em>responsible</em> for keeping people out of post-death hell by forcing them to follow islamic methods, such as covering hair and body for women (hijab), brutally murdered a girl named Mahsa Amini. This is not the first time but it became public and pushed people past their tolerance level. They came to streets to show their anger about the police/government brutality and demanded freedom from oppression. The street protests were answered by nationwide internet shutdowns and mass arrests and killings. These are ongoing events and it‚Äôs escalating quickly. Note that Twitter, Facebook, Instagram has been filtered by Iranian government and many other tools such as Github, Slack, and Google Cloud services has been geoblocking Iranian IPs due to sanctions. It seems that Meta is also removing the related content from Facebook and Instagram due to their ToS!!</p>
<p>One of the international outcomes of these global protests has been the distinction of people of Iran from Iran‚Äôs government regarding sanctions which is massive imo. US treasury <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0974" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">amended their ruling</a> for ‚ÄúInternet Freedom for Iranians‚Äù and opening up communication technology to prevent further oppression.</p>

            <p>I see the only path forward here - is that the proposal must be very specifically for the Farsi speaking community <em>OUTSIDE</em> of Iran.</p>
<p>The language of the proposal creates huge liability for Gitcoin and members of it‚Äôs community.  Any of the objectives of the grant, it‚Äôs affiliates and creators cannot have anything to do with directly providing support to Iranian citizens or companies.  In fact the language would need to reflect that it is specifically for the Farsi speaking community outside of Iran.  A good example of this is the crypto news website CoinIran - part of their mission is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Providing specialized personnel in the field of blockchains and cryptocurrencies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing advice and support to Iranian projects and start-ups in the field of blockchain</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This clear language is a smoking gun that prevents people in the western world from supporting or participating.  I didn‚Äôt dive anymore deeply into the other founders and creators of the grant.</p>
<p>In order to have any chance of making this dream a reality - there has to be careful consideration put into protecting the Gitcoin community and platform.  That means taking measurable tangible steps to distance yourself from any organization or people who are interested in Blockchain to circumnavigate the sanctions against Iran, Iranian nationals or organizations, or other individuals or groups that express a desire to teach blockchain technology to people in Iran.</p>

<p>Thanks Kevin for engaging in this conversation, I believe there‚Äôs no one at fault here but we should make sure we put forward the best practices for the decentralize web we believe in, same as what you are doing for public good at Gitcoin.</p>
<p>Hope to have a friendly conversation over some drinks at EthDenver with you <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <blockquote>
<p>Consider that this decision is affecting millions of innocent people that have a lot of hope in the dream of decentralization‚Ä¶</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have considered this, and I believe my OP addresses the amount of understanding we have for the gravity of this issue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now my question from anyone reading this, how can a constructive dialogue be established to deal with this sensitive matter?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, you can please stop spreading misinformation that Farsi language grants are not allowed on the platform.  (they are).   Grants that create legal risk for the Gitcoin community by implying they send money to sanctioned nations (or actually sending funds) are not. Grants that break the law are not.</p>
<p>From there,</p>
<ol>
<li>if there is a grant that has attained an exception to the sanctions, they can email proof of this fact to <a href="mailto:legal@gitcoin.co">legal@gitcoin.co</a></li>
<li>if you believe that the law is unfair or unjust, you can lobby the government (who is coercing Gitcoin to not host the grant) to change the law.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Here‚Äôs the <a href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/2215/solidity-development-course-by-women-in-blockchain">grant page</a> in question, AFAIK nothing was changed in the text except the Update on top regarding Giveth and DGrants update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have in my notes that there were 13 references to Iran back at the time this grant was disabled.<br>
Perhaps the grant has been edited by its author since it was first posted - I do not have the cycles today to restore a DB backup to find out if it has or not.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether there was 8 references to Iran or 13, the Grant‚Äôs implied support for those in sanctioned nations creates legal risk for Gitcoin‚Äôs community as interpreted by Gitcoin‚Äôs General Counsel.  We‚Äôve invited the community a number of times to email <a href="mailto:legal@gitcoin.co">legal@gitcoin.co</a> if they have attained an exception to sanctions and have not yet received an inquiry that meets the threshold set by our legal counsel.</p>
<p>I can appreciate &amp; understand the community‚Äôs frustration that our legal counsel‚Äôs guidance about EXACTLY where the line is is not clear.  Our legal counsel is also operating in an environment in which the letter of the law does not explicitly spell out EXACTLY where the line is, so I hope the community can understand &amp; appreciate the constraints that our legal counsel is operating under.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The issue is not with the grant‚Äôs nitty gritty details,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe it‚Äôs not an issue for you, but it is for people who bare legal risk because of a grant‚Äôs nitty gritty details.</p>
<p>The US government has already shown they are more than willing to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/united-states-citizen-pleads-guilty-conspiring-assist-north-korea-evading-sanctions">jail</a> those web3 enthusiasts who violate sanctions.</p>

            <p>This was not a respond I was expecting, as I thought to bring this subject back to this topic to have some constructive conversation and <em>continue to engage on this matter</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>First to address the point you raised, which I don‚Äôt find any useful to go in, but let‚Äôs entertain:</p>

<p>The grant had 13 references to the word ‚ÄúIran‚Äù in it,</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Here‚Äôs the <a href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/2215/solidity-development-course-by-women-in-blockchain" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">grant page</a> in question, AFAIK nothing was changed in the text except the Update on top regarding Giveth and DGrants update.</p>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: Free Smart Contract Development Course for Farsi Speaking Communities</p>
<p>I see 8 mention of the word ‚ÄúIran‚Äù:</p>
<ol>
<li>website: https:// smartcontract . coin<strong>iran</strong> . com</li>
<li>This opportunity, organized by the non-profit educational organization ‚ÄúCoin<strong>Iran</strong>‚Äù‚Äôs founder <a href="https://twitter.com/baharlikespring" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Bahar</a></li>
<li>Women in Blockchain‚Äôs Founder <a href="https://twitter.com/thessymehrain?lang=en" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Thessy Mehrain</a> (also ¬Ω <strong>Iran</strong>ian), was designed to teach all the fundamentals of smart contract development.</li>
<li>This indeed was huge for us. Participating in an international course, coming from <strong>Iran</strong>, enabled us to overcome ‚Ä¶</li>
<li>‚Ä¶ some of the everyday challenges imposed on <strong>Iran</strong>ian society.</li>
<li>The Farsi-speaking community has a population of more than 120 million, located in West Asia in Afghanistan, Tajikistan and <strong>Iran</strong>.</li>
<li>Moreover, heavy sanctions imposed on <strong>Iran</strong>ian citizens has limited them from accessing most social media platforms via <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/20/defi-isnt-better-than-tradfi-if-people-cant-use-it/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">geoblocking</a> and even <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/24/consensys-suddenly-bars-iranian-students-from-ethereum-coding-class/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">blocking educational platforms</a>, in this way making it difficult to gain access to accurate and up to date education content.</li>
<li>In this year‚Äôs ConsenSys Academy Ethereum developer bootcamp, we were able to sponsor 65 Farsi speaking individuals (45 from <strong>Iran</strong> and 20 from Afghanistan).</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>And regarding the second part:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>implied heavily that funds would be sent to sanctioned nations.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Here‚Äôs the line regarding compensation from the grant page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please support us in our mission! Not only will your funds <strong>help ensure that our volunteers get fairly compensated for the hard labour they put</strong> into managing and maintaining this course, but it will also <strong>help ensure that the course content and materials stay accessible and free to everyone</strong>!<br>
<strong>Let‚Äôs build a more equitable future by ensuring that everyone - regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, and geographical location - can benefit from blockchain.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was <strong>speculated</strong> that the volunteers are in ‚Äúsanctioned nations‚Äù. The volunteers are a combination of known actors living in countries such as Canada, Netherland, Armenia, and Afghanistan.</p>
<hr>
<p>The issue is not with the grant‚Äôs nitty gritty details, but more so how this was handled by Gitcoin and what the ecosystem learned from it (and took away from it).</p>
<p>Now my question from anyone reading this, how can a constructive dialogue be established to deal with this sensitive matter? Consider that this decision is affecting millions of innocent people that have a lot of hope in the dream of decentralization‚Ä¶</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/annbrody7/status/1468737168294256644">We see you</a>.  We hear you.  I wish we could help.</p>
<p>For those of you of Iranian heritage or based in Iran - your government and our gov don‚Äôt get along.  That‚Äôs not your fault as individuals.  That doesn‚Äôt mean that you don‚Äôt deserve human thriving.</p>
<p>But it does mean that Gitcoin Core, or any US based entity, is legally prohibited from allowing your grant to be live on our platform.  If your project is not at risk of violating sanctions, then please <a href="mailto:support@gitcoin.co">educate us</a> with supporting documentation. If that‚Äôs not feasible,  I understand your frustration with Gitcoin &amp; that you have to move on‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Our vision is to <a href="https://gitcoin.co">build &amp; fund digital public goods</a> to a diverse global community, and last week our vision collided with reality &amp; <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/when-we-come-up-short/9378/3">we came up short</a>.  We are extremely saddened by this situation and the effects it has on you, the community we set out to serve.  I hope that we continue to engage on this matter,  and I welcome your feedback &amp; comments below.</p>
