https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-make-merch-with-metafactory/21
    I've been dreaming of some kind of merch drop powered by Gitcoin designers for ages, would be great to get a collab competition of sorts going to crowd source designs for shirts, pants, $SOCKS or whatever kind of swag the community would like and distribute those items through the https://metafactory.ai/ portal, perhaps with some sort of proof of contribution that makes you eligible üí≠

Will keep pondering on this idea, if anyone else is excited about helping HMU üì®

            <p>I still properly need to wrap my head around this stuff, but I can make iron on embroidery patches and later this year pin badges as well.</p>
<p>I have a free open source game project <a href="https://AncientBeast.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://AncientBeast.com</a> and want to have it as DAO eventually and even allow community members to make and sell project related merchandise, so‚Ä¶ Metafactory might be something I was actually looking forward to.</p>

            <p>Hackathon winners for one.</p>
<p>Would be great to setup a season where top hackers earn kudos and can get custom merch with kudos patches showing off their accolades in life and the meta verse!</p>
