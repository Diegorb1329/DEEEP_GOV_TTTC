Using GTC to vote on Gitcoin Proposals
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/using-gtc-to-vote-on-gitcoin-proposals/16152
    We get a lot of questions from new stewards on how to use GTC to vote at Gitcoin. So I'm posting a quick guide here on how to use your GTC to vote on proposals. 

**Before anyone can vote, you *must* be delegated GTC!**

You can delegate your GTC to yourself or to other stewards.
Please note that any **staked GTC is not eligible for delegation**.

**How to delegate GTC to yourself**
* Go to https://www.tally.xyz/gov/gitcoin
* Connect your wallet containing GTC
* Press ‚ÄúDelegate vote‚Äù button and select the option ‚ÄúDelegate to myself‚Äù
* Confirm the transaction

**How to delegate to another Steward**
* Go to https://www.daostewards.xyz/
* Choose a Steward and select "Delegate"
* Connect your wallet containing GTC to the website
* Confirm the transaction

You can check how much GTC has been delegated to you here: https://www.daostewards.xyz/ and search your name, ENS or wallet address.

            <p>I‚Äôm one of our new stewards, on the Stewards Council. Looking forward to working with the folks here and being a responsible proxy for whoever feels comfortable delegating their DTC to me.</p>
