    Problem: I have done this bounty ( https://gitcoin.co/issue/ArtisticalIntelligence/Artistical_Intelligence/1/100026706 )  and now the bounty creator doesn't communicate and I have no way to make sure that I will get paid.

Suggested Solution: I was thinking to implement an arbitrable smart contract that is secured by Celest protocol in a way in which the bounty creator is forced to lock the reward into the contract so in case of a dispute Celest court can decide for the reward. 
I also want to implement it in a way so that the locked money will be pipe into a yield farming protocol ( like 88mph ) so the locked money won't be idle. The generated profit from 88mph will be distributed between bounty owner and GTC stakers.

            <p>So glad it has worked out!<br>
The owner disappearing is not exactly a fitting set of circumstances for an interesting set of ‚Äòconflict resolution‚Äô techniques.<br>
Now, if they claimed that the deliverable was lacking and refused to pay‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Would such a scenario make an interesting test case for a head-to-head Kleros and Celeste comparison, or is it too specific or too trivial?</p>

            <p>Thanks for posting this idea Ajand.   I will support this proposal.  It is a good example of supporting other daos.</p>
<p>Celeste also has potential to be used in the appeal processes and I am trying make this happen.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/bobjiang">@bobjiang</a> Oh, no. It‚Äôs actually a private repo hosted at <a href="https://artisticalintelligence.art/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://artisticalintelligence.art/</a>  and Happily, the owner started to communicating again, and everything is fine for now. But I think if we‚Äôre going to make bounties decentralized we need to first make them trustless and censorship-resistant.</p>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ajand">@Ajand</a></p>
<p>Glad to have you here, so would you share the github pr here?<br>
I cannot visit the Gitcoin bounty page (perhaps the owner removed them, Damn it!)</p>
<p>Thanks a lot <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=10" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ajand">@Ajand</a>!</p>
<p>Welcome on the <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/">GitcoinDAO</a> forum <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=10" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:"></p>
<p>I think it‚Äôs a legitimate question to ask, are ‚ÄúThese Bounties‚Äù sustainable, from the developer perspective but also from the bounty creator ‚Äúvision‚Äù.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not the first time I can see or read a user or dev ‚ÄúNot Complaining‚Äù but simply demanding inquiries about the payments following his work on a particular bounty.</p>
<p>What is the definition of sustainability: Good Coordination, Good Communication, Supportable, Viable, Livable and feasible‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I think you bring a good point that we could discuss further with the community.</p>
<p>Cheers! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/nerd_face.png?v=10" title=":nerd_face:" class="emoji" alt=":nerd_face:"></p>
