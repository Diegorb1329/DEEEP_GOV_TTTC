### [ü§ñ Meta-Governance](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/governance-meta/6)

* The Gitcoin DAO Steward Monthly was held on July 5th, Yalor and Anett [shared](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/stewards-calls-all-info/7410/2) the [agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f-SNt9o0iEIy78hqtt6ezOvorLk96DKH5FSHBDlCEUQ), a [recording](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/WVFA_L-Uc4DfABXRfIIEu6mCAPE_43giefLrk6l1X8E66tzOmwyM0Ffua6RA7J-O.438PhMyIUyTzKQ_7) of the meeting, and [notes](https://hackmd.io/@Bnkhqf0tSbi1lX2Xc-WXYQ/SJEWqog6d).

* Simona, Toby, and Ken have put forward an updated [DAO governance process](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-dao-governance-process-v1/7860) for review and ratification.

### [üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Workstream Discussion](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/workstream-discussion/9)

[Public Goods Funding / Treasury Management](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-public-goods-funding/129)

* A [proposal discussion](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-ratify-the-results-of-grants-round-10-and-formally-request-the-community-multi-sig-holders-to-payout-matching-allocations/7832) authored by DisruptionJoe asks Community Stewards to ratify the GR10 payout amounts as being correct, fair, and abiding to community norms, including the judgements and sanctions made by the[ Anti-Fraud Workstream](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-anti-fraud-workstream-assemble/158).

* The [website](https://akitarescue.dog/) app by Austin Griffith that lets Gitcoin approve certain amounts of Akita to be sold at the current market price has been tested to burn and sell ~6% of total AKITA

* UBIpromoter started a [discussion](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/improving-grant-matching-estimates-during-the-round/7809) around how grant matching estimates during Grants rounds can be improved to display more accurate numbers. Owocki [shared](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/improving-grant-matching-estimates-during-the-round/7809/3) [data](https://gitcoin.co/grants/stats) on how match estimates changed over time during GR10, by round.

* Yalor gave an [update](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/2-117-884-unclaimed-gtc-tokens/7237/54) In the thread on a second claim window for GTC stating that discussion ‚Äúhas not garnered enough support to even get to a proposal stage‚Äù.

* A [community call](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-onegtc-a-stablecoin-for-the-gitcoin-community/6505/23) was held on July 6th to discuss the stablecoin introduced by Lior. The ICHI team has begun working on a TL;DR-version of the value proposition of oneGTCto the Gitcoin community. A [Telegram group chat](https://t.me/joinchat/Ke8Vv4Cnfjk1ZDY8) has also been created for further discussion.

* Spugpow [proposed](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-implement-regular-opinion-polling-of-grant-contributors/7736) ways of implementing regular opinion polling of grant contributors that would allow contributors of grants to signal whether they are satisfied with how the project has used their donation or not.

* Shreyas is continuing to push forward a holistic treasury management strategy for review.

[Public Goods Prototyping (Moonshot Collective)](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-public-goods-prototyping/130)

* MoonshotCollective.space is live and we are collecting emails for our first meeting which will be after EthCC. Kevin and Austin are ‚Äúannouncing‚Äú the MoonshotCollective at EthCC

* Initial components and starter kits are also being hacked on so they can have some good examples at the first meeting

[Decentralization Workstream](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-decentralize-gitcoin/180)

* Development on the prototype has begun. You can see the beginnings of the GrantRegistry and GrantRounds contracts in the [contracts directory](https://github.com/dcgtc/dgrants/tree/main/contracts/contracts).

* Frank Chen has joined the workstream and will be taking on some of the project and product management responsibilities.

* We are tightly scoping the first iteration of the prototype build project in an effort to enable wider and more decentralized contribution.

* Richard Schumann has joined the workstream and is kicking off designing the UI for the Decentralized Grants dApp.

[Anti-Sybil Workstream](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-anti-fraud-workstream-assemble/158)

* BlockScience published a [post](https://medium.com/block-science/evaluating-the-anti-fraud-results-for-gitcoin-round-10-cec9277ce5b2) that evaluates their Anti-Fraud Results for Grants round 10. One of the results presented is the improvement around fraud tax: ‚ÄúThe fraud tax for Gitcoin Round 10 was $14,400, approximately 2.1% of the total matching funds of $700,000. (...) The fraud tax in Gitcoin Round 9 was $33,000, or a total of 6.6%. (...) We have many iterations and improvements planned for the sybil detection pipeline between now and the start of Gitcoin Round 11.‚Äù

* The [thread](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-disputes/7705) on Gitcoin Disputes by tjayrush sparked a discussion on ways to improve the mechanisms used to identify and settle disputes.

[Merch, Memes, Marketing Workstream](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-suggestion-mmm-merch-memes-marketing-for-public-goods-gitcoin-gitcoindao/7066)

* The deadline for the Gitcoin Meme contest has passed and the process of picking the winners is currently underway. Winners will be invited to join a meme squad for public digital goods.

* Steward Report Card designs and a general map of the Gitcoin DAO ecosystem are in progress.
