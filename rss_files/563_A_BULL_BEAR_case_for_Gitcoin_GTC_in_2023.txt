A BULL/BEAR case for Gitcoin/GTC in 2023
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-bull-bear-case-for-gitcoin-gtc-in-2023/12442
    # BASE SUMMARY

Gitcoin is DAO that makes Gitcoin Grants - a suite of protocols for distributing capital to any EVM based community.  It's protocols include
1. Gitcoin Passport - a protocol for creating sybil resistence
1. Gitcoin Grants Registry - a grants storage/retrieval protocol
1. Gitcoin Grants Round Manager - a protocol for easy CLR Funding for any DAO

In addition to Gitcoin Grants protocols, Gitcoin also offers a funding programs - basically Gitcoin Grants protocol as a service.

Gitcoin has reinvented itself as a DAO instead of a company.  It now has nearly 100% turnover of talent, governance, model, code from its days as a company in 2020.

# BULL CASE

## Gitcoin Grants

The bull case for GTC is that Gitcoin could be a "back office" tool or protocol for community capital allocation any EVM community out there.  That means any L1, L2, DAO, DeFi Protocol, NFT Project, etc could use Gitcoin's protocols to supercharge their ecosystem development.

[According to DeepDAO](https://deepdao.io/organizations) there is roughly $8 billion in assets in DAO treasuries.   According to [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) there is at least $200 billion in market cap for EVM chains.  According to [coincodex](https://coincodex.com/cryptocurrencies/sector/nft/) there is $7 billion in market cap for NFTs. According to [CMC there](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/defi/) is $38 billion in market cap for DEFI.  

In total that is $8 + $200 + $7 + $38 = $253 billion.    Assume 10x growth over the next 5 years, and thats $2.5 trillion in Total Addressable Market.  Assume 0.1% of this market cap is allocated for incentivizing community participation within these markets on a yearly basis, that is roughly $2.5 billion in serviceable market yearly - about 300x-1000x higher than what Gitcoin is doing now.

## Gitcoin Passport

Gitcoin Passport is a tool for creating sybil resistance on Gitcoin Grants, but also the wider EVM world.  It relies on verifiable credentials to create scoring of each unique identity on a basis of how human each user is.

Sybil Resistance is quite a small web3 market at this time, so it is hard to quantify.  But sybil resistance is a hard problem that has eluded computer science researchers for decades.  Similar hard problems being solved are breakthroughs and often have lead to commercial breakthroughs for the people that solve them.  Just as likely is that someone else commercializes a breakthrough and the original persons who addressed the problem is left behind.

I think the upside case for Gitcoin Passport is that an ecosystem of sybil resistant dApps are built on top of Passport.  I do not know how to quantify that.  Real world identity is a very foundational part of the state based economy - There is a similar opportunity to become foundational important part of the web3 economy.

I think Gitcoin is well positioned to address the sybil resistance problem because it has so much more experience & so much more data to do it than any other web3 project.

## Social Capital

Gitcoin has a lot of social capital.  With A list personalities like Vitalik talking about Gitcoin comes a lot of legitimacy.  With the funding of A list projects like Uniswap also comes a lot of legitimacy.  Being a leading brand in the ReFi space brings a lot of legitimacy.

This social capital is probably Gitcoin's biggest asset right now.  It is hard to quantify this social capital. There is probably a way to protect, extend, and monetize this social capital - especially if Gitcoin continues to grow.

## GTC

In my opinion, the bull case for GTC basically boils down to: 
1. Grants will be successful & have $billions/year in capital going through it.
2. Passport will be the foundation of a new sybil resistant economy in web3.
3. Governance rights to manage these systems will somehow become valuable.
4. GitcoinDAO will survive to get to that point.

# BEAR CASE

There is 1 bull case.  I think there are several bear cases, which I will go through individually below.  Each bear case I think is independent from each other, and the more bear cases Gitcoin can avoid the more likely I think the bull case is.

1. Gitcoin needs to keep perpetually fundraising to fund it's matching pool and no recurring source of funding has been found.  This is an uphill battle, but one that Gitcoin has demonstrated competency at at small scales.

2. Gitcoin Grants relies on sybil resistence, a hard problem that there is no solution for yet. As long as there is capital to be made by doing so, Gitcoin will keep getting attacked by sybil attackers.  This is an uphill battle, but one that Gitcoin has demonstrated competency at at small scales.

3. Gitcoin has a quite large team working for it.  The team is illegible and opaque to outsiders, expensive, and slow to ship useful software.  At times it can seem to me as an outsider that the team misses basic things in their product and go-to-market or seems the team almost tripping over itself.   DAO Governance is hard but important, running a DAO is new territory, and it is not clear that Gitcoin has figured it out yet.  Gitcoin has not explained its competitive positioning publicly or published its 2023 roadmap (like I said its illegible to outsiders) so I am operating with limited information here.

4. Gitcoin Grants and Gitcoin Passport need to find protocol market fit.  The old product hosted at gitcoin.co showed it can do $6.5 million / quarter in funding.  When will the new protocols flippen the old products in market?  When will they find protocol market fit?  Can they reach the $2.5 billion in serviceable market yearly I identify above?

5. The bear market will be long and so far has not been kind to GTC.  GTC is required to keep the lights on at GitcoinDAO, and it is not clear where new buyers are going to come from.  The token keeps going down.  Finding a floor for GTC means creating a credible narrative of why GTC is valuable medium and long term and so far is not on track - at least to as outsider.  There is presently no clear narrative or use case for GTC in sight, other than being used to dump on market and fund operations.  This is also an uphill battle.

Of these bear cases, i think number 5 is the most pressing.  Gitcoin's continued operation depends on the reflexive belief that GTC has value.  Reflexive = Directed back on itself.   Ryan Selkis covers this in the [2023 Messari trends report](https://messari.io/crypto-theses-for-2023), heres what he wrote:

> ‚ÄúYou might think DeFi protocols are financially set for life, but a deeper look into the com- position of each treasury suggests the opposite. The vast majority of the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù in these token treasuries is coming from the reflexive belief that the market will always absorb the new supply. That may happen in bull markets, but things can unwind sharply when volumes subside. In fact, that‚Äôs exactly what happened during May‚Äôs market crash.‚Äù

If GTC goes to 50-75 cents, then Gitcoin might have a shorter runway than the bear market may last (2-3 years).    


# Conclusion

I was attracted to Gitcoin because it seemed different than many other projects and it seemed like a fun challenge to try and value it. I wrote this post to explain how I as a fan of Gitcoin view it in market.  I am rooting for your success and I hope that these steel-mans of both the bull and bear case are helpful to others too. I wish you success in 2023 Gitcoin!

A BULL/BEAR case for Gitcoin/GTC in 2023
ZER8

            <p>Thank you for taking the time to write this post. I think you have an excellent view on things and I personally loved the way you ‚Äúzoomed in‚Äù on some issues like 3, while also ‚Äúzooming out‚Äù on others like 4.</p>
<p>Idk why my intuition tells me that we will have a big positive surprise this year in store for GTC. I think that the team didn‚Äôt want 2 attach a use case for GTC, just to create utility in a kinda ‚Äúforced‚Äù and web2ish way.</p>
<p>My view is that there are 3 scenarios that could take place:</p>
<ol>
<li>Extended bear market in which GTC could go as low as 0.1$</li>
<li>Mixed sentiment market, meaning that the bears and bulls will fight until the next halving (2024) in which case GTC could go to 0.25-0.75 $ range.</li>
<li>Pseudo bull market, GTC goes over 2$</li>
</ol>
<p>GTC use case is not an easy one, but I‚Äôm sure that the contributors, WS leads, SC and stewards(like me) are actively strategizing, thinking, etc</p>

            <p>Very interesting read.<br>
I am also a fan of Gitcoin. I hold GTC, read the Digest, contribute to other projects, and participate as grantee.<br>
I am grateful for Gitcoin and the thoughtful team that has enabled so much impact to be achieved.<br>
That said.<br>
There‚Äôs a step back to give to understand what does value mean. If we are here for speculating with the economic return GTC can provide to holders, then it‚Äôs the path ahead.<br>
But what if value is something different?</p>
<p>Honest questions, I‚Äôd appreciate getting answers from others:<br>
Does Gitcoin need to speculate with GTC to survive? Can Gitcoin maintain itself with other ways, such as a fee for the stewarding and promotion of funding campaigns, or working group units that compete and collaborate to deliver value to the ecosystem?</p>
<p>A blessed 2023 for all you champs who are using your living time to do good in the world.</p>

<p>Yes. However, the mutual grants that were considered were totally new startups or DAOs (DeveloperDAO, PrimeDAO, Wonderverse) or exchange of governance and holdings (Radical). My thinking is that we didn‚Äôt subsidize businesses the users of the protocol would need like:</p>
<ul>
<li>a good way to scale grant reviews</li>
<li>a way to benefit from economies of scale in grant reviews</li>
<li>an evaluation ecosystem for grant or user reviews</li>
<li>an appeals insurance for users and grants</li>
<li>freemium sybil defense with upgraded features</li>

<p>I don‚Äôt think it is about the $$$ already given, though I‚Äôm sure some disagree. i think it is about the following scenarios</p>
<ul>
<li>a workstream manages their treasury well and makes profit</li>
<li>a workstream applies for a grant outside of gitcoin that overlaps with gitcoin work</li>
<li>a workstream finds and sells revenue generating services</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of returning these to the DAO treasury, these funds should be the future investment. Basically, anything you make while the DAO is still subsidizing your business. That said, I think workstreams should try to spin out profit generators with their knowledge and expertise, but the workstreams may still exist until their core problem is solved.</p>

<p>The current expectation is that revenue from a workstream should go to the DAO treasury, but a less considered option is that it could be kept by the workstream and contractually seen as a SAFE/SAFT type investment allowing the workstream to spin out a subDAO or corp that is profitable AND dependent on grants/project/passport protocols.</p>

A BULL/BEAR case for Gitcoin/GTC in 2023
DisruptionJoe

            <p>I think the biggest thing that we are missing in a mutual grants focus is that we have workstreams currently thinking about how to create revenue, but no plan on how to invest in their unique knowledge.</p>
<p>Workstreams which have been efficient and properly managed their treasury would be great candidates for building for profit businesses on top of the protocol.</p>
<p>The current expectation is that revenue from a workstream should go to the DAO treasury, but a less considered option is that it could be kept by the workstream and contractually seen as a SAFE/SAFT type investment allowing the workstream to spin out a subDAO or corp that is profitable AND dependent on grants/project/passport protocols.</p>
<p>Why is this better? At the end of the day, for-profit businesses using the protocol will have incentive to pay for the sustainability of the protocol. Giving the DAO more runway doesn‚Äôt have the same effect.</p>
<p>Imagine we are building a city. We want people to move in, but there are no grocery stores or gas stations. We could subsidize the businesses to startup when they will be at a loss, but hoping more people will move in when the necessary services are there. My suggestion is that we encourage our workstreams to spin out for profit businesses.</p>
<p>If we can create a model to successfully spin out for profit businesses, we will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Extend runway by having less contributor salaries in the DAO. Workstreams are incentivized to get their own revenue and become sustainable.</li>
<li>Use SAFE/SAFT investment to keep stake in ventures (We could sell this if it discourages competition in the future)</li>
<li>Shift GitcoinDAO internal public goods funding to be fully governed by GTC holders. As workstreams spin out they create an aqueduct to partially fund the main program and partially fund GitcoinDAO specific needs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Protocol fees could go back to the DAO treasury or to an aqueduct which drives continuous GTC token holders decisions on the program and which protocol public goods to fund. It doesn‚Äôt have to be that no revenue goes back to DAO treasury, just that workstream generated revenue could be used as investment rather than extended runway. Think about it, if we need the extended runway cause there aren‚Äôt for-profit businesses using it already, we probably already lost‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Most importantly, we need to reset our essential intents ASAP. They weren‚Äôt designed for staying forever. They should be updated every 6 months or so. This conversation has a little more of my thoughts on the essential intents. <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/november-csdo-digest/12338/13" class="inline-onebox">November CSDO Digest - #13 by DisruptionJoe</a></p>

</aside>
<p>There is no requirement of time to be a Steward.  Some really dig in and are recognized via a nomination to join the Steward Council as a web3 leader and advisor for Gitcoin, others casually join the update calls once per month to ask questions to get the early updates on things like branding, strategic plans, budget and protocol updates.   Others are recognized for their thoughtful input and are awarded greater influence via delegated GTC from holders who do not have time to participate in the governance process, but who still want to put their GTC to work.</p>
<p>We do strive to get better at transparency - for an example this subject was discussed yesterday (01.03) in the CSDO meeting here - <a href="https://youtu.be/1M99hKkkD6c?t=2517" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">CSDO Ops 01/03</a>  but one of the existing ways we disseminate information, help people connect and build context while we strive for decentralization is via our Stewards and our monthly Steward Circle meetings.  We have a big tent, and interested parties are all invited to join.</p>

<li>Passport will be the foundation of a new sybil resistant economy in web3.<br>

            <p>This is a wonderfully robust discussion.<br>
So many erudite and nuanced perspectives.<br>
This discussion makes me think of a podcast I heard recently - the TL;DR being that DAOs should be seen as startups, benefiting from a lean structure, that can then mature into decentralization.</p>
<p>Bottomline - Gitcoin is one of the most, if not <em>the</em> most, successful org Web3 has. So‚Ä¶ fascinating to learn about the innerworkings.  Thank you for this thread.</p>
<p>Peace, Happiness &amp; Prosperity to All You/ Us Public Gooders in 2023 &amp; beyond!!</p>

<p>Insiders seem to have a lot more context than GTC holders (eg there is a 2023 roadmap that has not been made public yet).

<p>I am transparency / decentralize maxi and I have come to see both as a journey - which I am not sure any DAO has gotten quite right just yet.  But hey, DAOs all still a new experiment so I tend to dial back my natural impatience and nudge every chance I get.</p>
<p>Recall that we do spend quite some time developing our Gitcoin Steward network where the stewards are given monthly updates, do deep dive critiques on draft budgets, and ask questions direct to workstream leaders.  Also a feature of that meeting is open air time where a steward can ask any pending questions they like.   We also turn to those same stewards to vote on proposals and help determine the future of Gitcoin.</p>
<p>Becoming a steward is open to every(single)person and we welcome anyone with (or without) GTC.   We strive to make that venue as helpful as possible to all stewards - but as said, we are on a journey and we still have lots to learn.</p>

<p>Information flows are some of the hardest things to get right at scale ( especially in a distributed working environment). This is not just a problem for Gitcoin but for pretty much all DAOs in general. I‚Äôve yet to see anything close to a perfect knowledge management system deployed in Web3 but I think this is an area where GitcoinDAO could experiment and lead. Getting greater community awareness around a single, well-maintained KMS could go a long way to helping people easily self-serve on getting up to speed on all things Gitcoin.</p>

            <p>A small critique: Tally is really a formality within the gitcoin governance process. Voting really occurs on Snapshot and then Stewards move that vote on-chain (through Tally) according to the decision produced by Snapshot. So the voting weight in reality might be different (but maybe not). Either way, there are a few major delegates that have a lot of sway in voting, which is a problem. We‚Äôre in agreement on that.</p>
<p>For the rest of what you said here, I definitely agree. I think the internal contributors are realizing what you are describing and trying harder, but in my opinion, it is ridiculously hard to get context within the GitcoinDAO, which does not bode well for a community-governed project. I think part of the conflict as well is that it is unclear what the decision-making jurisdiction is of the core contributors (CSDO and the Workstreams), and what is under the jurisdiction of the community (Steward Council, Stewards, Token holders, non-holding community members).</p>
<p>If you (or anyone else) are interested, I think creating a guide on where to find this context (if it is known, or getting it from internal contributors if it isn‚Äôt) would be a worthy project that I‚Äôd want to help out with. Feel free to send a message to me on here or on discord if you want to talk about this.</p>

A BULL/BEAR case for Gitcoin/GTC in 2023
climateXcrypto

            <p>I very much appreciate you raising these two cases for Gitcoin and GTC. I‚Äôm not a GTC holder (yet) but I am a grateful beneficiary of grants via the Gitcoin and want to support the success of this community.</p>
<p>I am very curious to know why Gitcoin doesn‚Äôt just introduce fees for all grants distributed via the protocol?</p>
<p>It seems like the most logical thing to do from a business perspective. As a grant recipient (and a donor) I would be much happier if I knew Gitcoin had a sustainable business model and were capturing some of the value that they create.</p>
<p>Is there any public-facing discussion on this matter?</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>From spending a lot of time researching on the forum, here are my observations:</p>
<p>Insiders seem to have a lot more context than GTC holders (eg there is a 2023 roadmap that has not been made public yet).   In a DAO without these information asymmetries there would be no non-public context because all the contributors <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Working-Public-Making-Maintenance-Software/dp/0578675862" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">work in public</a>.</p>
<p>Insiders have a lot more ability to navigate the DAO‚Äôs resources than outsiders.  Theres a lot of info that isnt listed on the <a href="https://gitcoin.co/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">gitcoin.co</a> navigation.  For example , I only found <a href="http://docs.passport.gitcoin.co/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">docs.passport.gitcoin.co</a> and <a href="https://showcase.passport.gitcoin.co/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">showcase.passport.gitcoin.co</a> bc I asked a dev friend to do some diligence on Gitcoin with me.  How do I spin up a Grants instance?  Where are the docs for it?  Why aren‚Äôt these resources accessible in the main nav?  <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/person_shrugging.png?v=12" title=":person_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":person_shrugging:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/person_shrugging.png?v=12" title=":person_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":person_shrugging:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/person_shrugging.png?v=12" title=":person_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":person_shrugging:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p><a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/november-csdo-digest/12338/2">From this post series</a> it seems there is friction between insiders who want higher compensation, whereas some GTC holders who want to be more frugal or want to see more progress for the GTC given before giving higher compensation.</p>
<p>There seems to be a higher sense of urgency to turn around the declining token price from outside GTC holders than from insiders.</p>
<p>There is generally a lot of visioning and thoughtleadering that goes on on the gov forums, but not a lot of execution visible.  How is the DAO doing against it‚Äôs purpose and essential intents?  Against it‚Äôs competitors?  I have no idea, insiders don‚Äôt publish that information - so thats why I do <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/web3-sybil-resistance-tool-competitive-landscape/12461">here</a> and <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/web3-crowdfunding-tool-competitive-landscape/12266">here</a>.</p>
<p>For insiders, GTC Holders are seen as dispensable whereas insiders are not.  For GTC Holders, there is no alternative to just going along with insiders.  There is no competition or market for DAO leadership.</p>

<li>Want an alternative approach to software development?  Too bad, you‚Äôre stuck with GPC and it‚Äôs leadership.</li>
<li>Want an alternative approach to fraud defense?  Too bad, you‚Äôre stuck with FDD and it‚Äôs leadership.</li>

<p>This situation also gives me pause.  Recently, I was reading in another forum how a protocol suggested pulling a major decision away from contributors and move it to the tokenholders - declaring it a win for ‚Äúdecentralization‚Äù.  In reality, it took what was a weighted vote of 30 contributors and put it in the hands of about five whales.</p>
<p>I am thinking about how to measure decentralization - not because I am making a value decision on if the current weighting or ‚Äúpower‚Äù is right, but because sometimes it is helpful to put your finger on a map and say ‚Äúwe are here‚Äù.  Thank you <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/a33titude">@a33titude</a> for the prompt.</p>

            <p>Can you link that tally page?</p>
<p>And I agree that power is pretty concentrated currently, but we‚Äôre in a better spot in my opinion because those stewards are rather benevolent and open to outsider opinions. I also think that by my observations and by the things you have pointed out, GTC right now is closer to a worker coop that listens to community input, as opposed to a DAO governed by their community.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm curious about your second point.</p>

</aside>
<p>I‚Äôm glad to hear a 2023 roadmap is in the works, but this leads me to another line of questioning.</p>
<p>Gitcoin seems to work different than other DAOs I follow.  Instead of working out the roadmap in public on the governance forums, there is somewhere else that a core team does the core work &amp; it happens without community input - then it is posted to the gov forum.  Why are the drafts written behind closed doors?  Don‚Äôt you want community input?  [These 2 questions apply for the roadmap, but more broadly too!]</p>

<blockquote>
<h2>GTC</h2>
<p>In my opinion, the bull case for GTC basically boils down to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Grants will be successful &amp; have $billions/year in capital going through it.</li>
<li>Passport will be the foundation of a new sybil resistent economy in web3.</li>
<li>Governance rights to manage these systems will somehow become valuable.</li>
<li>GitcoinDAO will survive to get to that point.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I will be following closely in the coming quarter to see where these four points trend.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>To my understanding (and I could be wrong), as Gitcoin shifts from cGrants to the Grants Protocol, it will no longer be Gitcoin‚Äôs responsibility to find funding for the matching pool, rather, those running grants programs on the protocol will bear that responsibility for themselves. Now, of course, if Gitcoin continues to run its own rounds on the protocol (which it seems is very likely), Gitcoin will have to figure out where that money is coming from (which may be what you are referring to here).</p>

<p>In addition to passports, Gitcoin has the FDD workstream that has experience in active sybil detection.

<p>The bear market will be long and so far has not been kind to GTC. GTC is required to keep the lights on at GitcoinDAO, and it is not clear where new buyers are going to come from. The token keeps going down. Finding a floor for GTC means creating a credible narrative of why GTC is valuable medium and long term and so far is not on track - at least to as outsider. There is presently no clear narrative or use case for GTC in sight, other than being used to dump on market and fund operations. This is also an uphill battle.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Within the same vein as this ‚Äúbear‚Äù but not explicitly mentioned is that Gitcoin has yet to identify a reliable and sufficient stream of revenue, which will be critical to keeping the lights on even if Gitcoin finds some way to make token go up.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd also add one last challenge for Gitcoin. Within Gitcoin‚Äôs mission is to create massive value for the Ethereum ecosystem; however, the more we succeed in this goal, the more attractive it will be for attackers to try and manipulate/influence the DAO. Right now, under the current token voting model, we are incredibly vulnerable to centralized takeover by wealthy attackers. I do not believe that GTC token holdership is super diverse. As in, a large amount of GTC is held by a small group of benevolent actors. Would that be fair to say? <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/disruptionjoe">@DisruptionJoe</a> <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/shawn16400">@shawn16400</a></p>

<p>As a GTC holder, point number 3 really resonated with me.</p>
<p>I found GTC because of the posts on vitalik.ca and started following it because I thought it was a market leader.</p>
<p>But the market doesnt seem to be viewing GTC as a leader anymore.</p>

<p>Not just the $GTC markets, but also the DAO and DEFI markets. Only a handful of those projects use Gitcoin.</p>
<p>I will be closely following the alpha protocol rounds and the convos on <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-utility-of-gtc/10071/17">GTC Utility</a> to see if this is going to turn around.</p>
<p>Additionally, I hope that Gitcoin insiders start to publish their plans for 2023 and beyond.</p>
