GTC Conviction Voting dApp => Network Utility
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gtc-conviction-voting-dapp-network-utility/10523
    I wanted to share a dApp prototype that @austingriffith & two of the BuidlGuidl builders built (Viraz + 0xDarni).

This is a dApp that allows a user to stake GTC on Gitcoin Grants based on the Grant quality using [Conviction Voting](https://medium.com/giveth/conviction-voting-a-novel-continuous-decision-making-alternative-to-governance-aa746cfb9475).   From there, Gitcoin Grants 1.0 (or 2.0) could then adjust the sort algorithm of the grants based on what grants GTC holders think is most valuable.

Problems this dApp solves:
1. Allow GTC Holders to have governance utility with their GTC.
2. Provide fairer starting conditions to the Gitcoin Grants rounds, so it does not become a horse race (where ppl get more contributions => higher matching => repeat)

Check out the demo of this conviction voting dapp.  It allows people to trustlessly stake GTC on their favorite grants, signaling their conviction about which grants are quality.

# Roadmap from here
1. Audit the smart contracts
2. Deploy on Optimism L2
3. Simplify the UX
4. (If governance decides to) Adopt this data as part of the sorting algorithm on Gitcoin Grants.

# Links:
1. Play with the demo yourself: https://gtc.v37.io/
2. Checkout [the Github](https://github.com/0xDarni/scaffold-eth/tree/conviction-voting-gitcoin)
3. [Demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHwUs9m45sA)
4. [What is conviction voting?](https://medium.com/giveth/conviction-voting-a-novel-continuous-decision-making-alternative-to-governance-aa746cfb9475)

# This was built in 3 days!

## What can we learn from this?

What I think is incredible about this prototype is that Austin + crew conceived + built this in 3 days!

They didnt hire any fancy consultants.  They aren't spending $200k-300k/mo on software development.  This was just someone who cares about Gitcoin who chose to work backwards from an outcome + ship the software (and will probably be rewarded retroactively from Build Gulid/Gitcoin if/once this ships).  It's really inspiring to me!

What can we learn from this type of rapid prototyping?  Can we sprinkle some of this culture in the Moonshot Collective + Gitcoin Product Group so that we can ship [Grants 2.0 well before the overton window closes](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-overton-window-for-grants-2-0/10461)?

IMO its existential to solve our software dev velocity problems.  We cannot continue to plow hundreds of thousands of dollars into software development that is neither [fast, cheap, nor good](https://fastgood.cheap/).  Questions about priorities are only existential when it takes us 2-6 months to ship any new module.  If we could quickly ship slim MVPs it would be less of a zero sum "my priority vs yours" between leaders.

I am a strong advocate of focusing on [minimum shippable increments](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/minimum-shippable-increments/10140).  This GTC Conviction Voting dApp is a great emergent example of that.


# Prompts

1. How can we get more rapid prototyping juju (build guild culture) into MSC/GPG?  Daniele showed here that a steel thread for a small dApp takes 2-3 days if you have the right builder on a project/focused on outcomes.
2. Do we want to support this conviction voting app as part of grants 2.0 roadmap?

            <p>Giveth is going to be launching GIVpower, which is something very similar to the work being done here. The first part of it, the staking and locking, rolls out is tomorrow.</p>
<p>There should be lots of interesting Comms around it on our twitter and it might be fun to check it out.</p>

            <p>Is the 23232+4760 GTC that’s still being staked continuing to accrue conviction bonus for upcoming rounds, or are these reset prior to each GR?</p>
<p>If the bonus carries over into GR15, will new staker be able to catch up in time for launch without a considerably larger amount of GTC? Or phrased differently; What percentage of their maximum conviction bonus have the GR14 stakers accumulated?</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a> good question.</p>
<p>There’s a lot that we cannot measure, for example I would love to know how often the new sorting was used on <a href="http://gitcoin.co" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">gitcoin.co</a> while the round was going.</p>
<p>That said, we think it worked great.</p>
<p>Some numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>23232 GTC still staked on Mainnet</li>
<li>4760 GTC still staked on Optimism <a href="https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x1eba7a6a72c894026cd654ac5cdcf83a46445b08#balances" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">about about 60% of the total</a>  as of now</li>
<li>Highest amount staked was about 50K GTC on Mainnet - Optimism has been stable</li>
<li>54 unique stakers across the two networks</li>
</ul>
<p>So let me turn the question back to you, <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a>, and to the DAO: what would have to be true for us to use conviction voting as the default sorting method for next round?</p>

            <p>I’m also very much interested in the ‘answer’ to this question… I’m not currently a GTC holder, but I want to be and I would like to acquire it/keep it on the chain where it has the most utility.</p>

<p>So I think this is a good idea in the long run! But not for GR14. And such a last minute change should go through governance.</p>

            <p>heads up this is live now</p>
<p>how to use GTC to stake on the gitcoin grants you believe in 3 easy steps</p>
<ol>
<li>go to <a href="https://t.co/4BOxC4aFcz">http://voting.gitcoin.co</a>
</li>
<li>stake your GTC on either mainnet or optimism</li>
<li>browse to <a href="https://t.co/8P0WRpB1pF">http://gitcoin.co/grants</a> and select “GTC Conviction Voting” as your sort order</li>
</ol>
<p>itll look like this:</p>

<p>Wherever it makes sense <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"><br>
Is the DAO planning on moving GTC to an L2, even partially?</p>
<p>If you ask me, then I’d say long term an L2. Short term we could do L2, it just requires some work on the UX.</p>
<p>The reason we went for Mainnet is that <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/austingriffith">@austingriffith</a> tried bridging to Optimism and it cost him 41 USD to transfer 1 GTC:</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/f/fb57787c8292f6041242383027305fe07a1be28e.png" data-download-href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/fb57787c8292f6041242383027305fe07a1be28e" title=""><img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/f/fb57787c8292f6041242383027305fe07a1be28e_2_690x118.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="zRtfvkrffsUJxW9R1Cq7RWYFTrM" role="presentation" width="690" height="118" srcset="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/f/fb57787c8292f6041242383027305fe07a1be28e_2_690x118.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/f/fb57787c8292f6041242383027305fe07a1be28e_2_1035x177.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/f/fb57787c8292f6041242383027305fe07a1be28e_2_1380x236.png 2x" data-dominant-color="F8F9FA"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Presumably you’d have to transfer back to L1 if you want to use the tokens for something else.</p>
<p>On top of that right now the UX is not great - this thread explains what Austin had to do:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/austingriffith/status/1522671054308610048?s=20&amp;t=jrp1o2jiuc-GNBtv-ZtXjQ" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://twitter.com/austingriffith/status/1522671054308610048?s=20&amp;t=jrp1o2jiuc-GNBtv-ZtXjQ</a></p>
<p>Nothing that can’t be solved: we can quickly build a UI to let people bridge GTC to Optimism in a few clicks from the dApp, or we can use a different L2.</p>
<p>We can do anything <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>I think the decision in the end should be coming from you / the DAO. I am not aware of what the long term plans are for the token and L2 adoption.</p>
