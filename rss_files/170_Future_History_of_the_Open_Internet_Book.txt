    I gave a talk at Devcon in 2019 entitled [Future History of the Open Internet](https://owocki.com/future-history-open-internet/) about the deep history of Open Source Software + how Ethereum could continue that legacy.

Fast forward to 2022 - when @ceresstation introduced me to [peace_node](https://twitter.com/peace_node) (who is an amazing digital artist) last winter, and we were looking to create a peace of lore for the space, we decided to make this talk into a book.

Without further adeau, here it is!

            <p>Yes! You are speaking my language - also, with the Heroâ€™s Journey, our society needs an updated mythology, because the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves shapes what we believe we are capable of.</p>
<p>Our team has created is a powerful system that makes regenerating the earth PROFITABLE - even in our present market system.</p>
<p>But, more than that - it contains the seeds that will help TRANSFORM the market system into a decentralized network of local economies who all self-regulate while operating in harmony.</p>
<p>Our currency will not be mined and extracted - it will be harvested via measuring and tracking the health of our living ecosystems!</p>
<p>Caring for our planet becomes the basis for our currency, which means all produce has a cost that is equivalent to the ecological cost to produce and deliver it.</p>
<p>This builds in constant incentive to protect ecosystems right into our monetary system.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s a long plan, but a solid foundation!</p>
