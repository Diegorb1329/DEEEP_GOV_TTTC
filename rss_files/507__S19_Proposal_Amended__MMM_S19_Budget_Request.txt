[S19 Proposal Amended] MMM S19 Budget Request
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s19-proposal-amended-mmm-s19-budget-request/16218
    ## TL;DR

In S18 & 19 the MMM Workstream is going to continue its focus on one overarching north-star goal: **Reposition Gitcoin as a tech-first organization**. To do so, we are requesting a budget of $448,435 (changed from $560,500 in our initial S18/19 budget request).

To accomplish this goal, MMM will focus on the following strategic marketing areas in S18/19:



* Drive awareness, engagement, adoption and fandom of our products (product and growth marketing)
* Continue to establish and build hype for our products and Gitcoin’s overarching brand (brand marketing)
* Shift existing audience perceptions through PR and community engagement initiatives (PR and supporting community engagement)
* Bolster the narrative of our tech’s impact with meaningful impact reporting (research & impact reporting)


## **Amount**

MMM’s S19 budget request is for $448,435 (-20.01% change vs S18 budget). After accounting for remaining budget & reserves (and 33% reserves budget for S19), MMM is requesting $276,419 for Season 19 from the treasury.

A full breakdown of the budget can be found at the end of this post.

## **Milestone Report for the past Season**

[Please use this link to view the MMM OKR tracker.](https://gitcoin.notion.site/OKR-Tracker-ffcc6e6b3e564b069ad0be407633a0a0?pvs=4) A summary of highlights re: OKRs from S18 includes:

* Big wins at EthCC with 100+ leads on both DevRel and Partnerships (shoutout to @azeem and @0xZakk for their partnership on this and @meglister for representing Grants Stack)
* Lots of cancelled projects on Allo with the switch to v2 launch in Sept/Oct
* Lots of wins on Passport marketing, misses are around designing funnels and tracking conversions (S19 focus)
* Several cancelled projects around whitepapers & research due to resourcing constraints
* Most brand marketing initiatives still in progress, wrapping up early-to-mid S19
* Major Schelling Point conference in Istanbul is currently cancelled
* Thought leadership initiatives are underway but behind schedule

## Budget Update 

We are still orienting toward the goals we had set at the beginning of S18 with one added distinction (note growth marketing included in our focus):

![MMM Priorities|690x332](upload://oJ3sVx7YDkQL2lwgoZiKKiNdSUq.png)

## What’s changing


### Budget and headcount



* From: 
    * 8 FT contributors
    * 4 FT contributors budgeted for
    * 8 PT contributors
* To:
    * 8 FT contributors (1 onboarded, 1 offboarded, 2 salary-leveled)
    * 8 PT contributors (1 reduced # of hours)
* Budget decrease of ±20%


### Shifting Priorities



* Major focus of S19: Wrap up brand design work and double-down on sales enablement, qualifying leads and tracking conversions through our marketing funnels
* Other changes:
    * Canceling vast majority of research initiatives relating to bolstering thought leadership due to resourcing constraints
        * We will continue to execute existing research-related activities that directly relate to product marketing
    * This move will impact our impact reporting initiative but we are still working on that at a reduced capacity.
    * We will be continuing to zero in and refine marketing metrics tracking and reporting
* We will be redirecting considerable design resources to support in-app development on Passport and Grants Stack

<li>Major focus of S19: Wrap up brand design work and double-down on sales enablement, qualifying leads and tracking conversions through our marketing funnels</li>
<li>Other changes:
<ul>
<li>Canceling vast majority of research initiatives relating to bolstering thought leadership due to resourcing constraints
<ul>
<li>We will continue to execute existing research-related activities that directly relate to product marketing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This move will impact our impact reporting initiative but we are still working on that at a reduced capacity.</li>
<li>We will be continuing to zero in and refine marketing metrics tracking and reporting</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We will be redirecting considerable design resources to support in-app development on Passport and Grants Stack</li>
