# Summary

Education is a cornerstone in the successful implementation of any new endeavor. Its significance in fostering widespread adoption is undeniable. Reflecting on the success of Gitcoin in facilitating Quadratic Funding rounds for Ethereum, it's evident that extending these benefits to other DAOs and communities was the next logical step.

In a similar vein, the Optimism Collective has pioneered the RPGF experiment. The time is ripe to extend this to other DAOs and communities, allowing them to witness and harness the magic of RPGF funding within their own ecosystems, using [EasyRetroPGF.xyz ](https://t.co/3XYfjyO4KX)

However, for any DAO to use this, it involves more than just learning from successes and challenges. It's crucial to assimilate the best practices, guidelines, and detailed methodologies that underpin such initiatives. This is precisely why we are introducing our Optimism style RPGF training program. Targeted primarily at grant managers and those keen on mastering the art of conducting RPGF rounds using [EasyRetroPGF.xyz ](https://t.co/3XYfjyO4KX), this program aims to impart the necessary knowledge and skills. Below, you will find the comprehensive curriculum we have developed for this purpose.

            <p>Very cool work and would love to participate in the training, submitting an application.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm wondering if it might makes sense to conduct a RetroPGF round in Developer DAO. Our token lacks liquidity/price, so as a short-term funding mechanism for public goods it is not ideal. However, I‚Äôd love to see us explore mechanisms to both rebalance the token distribution in our currently active community members vs those who were more active early on, particularly rewarding folks who contribute a lot of value in the community but earn a much lower proportion of token rewards as their contributors are harder to define than performing a specific role. I also see a lot of potential value in the idea of distributing governance power to ecosystem PG participants who share our mission, values and goals.</p>
