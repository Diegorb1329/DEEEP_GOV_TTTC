    Hi Gitcoin,
I made some donations before the grant 10 period ended through the Zksync method. The payment was confirmed on etherscan also my ether was deducted successfully as you can see here (https://zkscan.io/explorer/accounts/0x5fc32e1E33dDC5D8ad0a3d9242c83D59A914e7dD). But gitcoin is missing my contributions, I tried adding it manually but it didn't work. Now my account is showing zero contributions. I received notifications from gitcoinbot about my transactions was successful but my profile rank was not updated. My gitcoin handle is: @minhdust98. 
I asked for help on discord but there was no response. I found out many users had the same problem as I am on discord. 
Hopefully, Gitcoin's dev could see and fix this problem.
