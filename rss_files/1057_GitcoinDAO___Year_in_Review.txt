As GR14 comes to an end with a record-breaking turnout Iâ€™m excited to announce the publication of the [GitcoinDAO - Year in Review](https://gitcoindao.com/yearinreview/yir.pdf)!  ðŸŽ‚

On May 25th we celebrated our first year as a DAO. Throughout the year weâ€™ve published weekly newsletters with the latest and greatest from the various moving parts of GitcoinDAO. Today Iâ€™m thrilled to share our very first edition of a yearly review! ðŸŽ‰

The Year in Review aims to encapsulate the highlights and accomplishments from last year and recognize our fantastic set of contributors, stewards and workstreams. Part of the document is also dedicated to explore this new year of possibilities and ambitions.

This last year has been incredible and I'm grateful and humbled to be part of such an amazing group of individuals tirelessly working towards building a better future for all.

Sending virtual hugs to everyone who helped and a very special thanks to @umarkhaneth & @IamJvck ðŸ’š

*(Psst, there is a puzzle hidden within the document. The first person to solve the puzzle will receive 200GTC and a $100 merch coupon for the [Gitcoin swag store]( https://store.gitcoin.co/), good luck!)*
