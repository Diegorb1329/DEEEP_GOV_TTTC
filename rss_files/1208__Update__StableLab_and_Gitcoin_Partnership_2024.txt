https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/update-stablelab-and-gitcoin-partnership-2024/19567
    Dear Gitcoin Community,

As we leave October, we‚Äôre happy to provide an update on the activities of [Gitcoin and StableLab‚Äôs engagement](https://stablelab.xyz/blog/stablelab-partners-with-gitcoin-to-enhance-dao-to-dao-collaborations-and-strategic-partnerships) over the past six months. This partnership was aimed at leveraging StableLab‚Äôs position in the Web3 governance landscape to enhance DAO-to-DAO engagements, amplifying Gitcoin's influence in the broader ecosystem and driving Gross Market Value (GMV) for Allo. Below, we present a comprehensive summary of our activities from May to October 2024, along with insights into lessons learned and our plans for the future.

### Priorities & Objectives for Gitcoin and StableLab Partnership:

* Identify opportunities for collaboration with DAOs that have established and active grant programs.
* Foster strategic partnerships to enhance Gitcoin‚Äôs adoption and influence.
* Drive Gross Market Value (GMV) for the Allo Protocol.

### Key Activities and Progress | May to October 2024

**May 2024**
* Drafted initial documents for Allo and Token Swap proposals.
* Compiled a matrix of projects with existing grant programs for potential collaboration with Gitcoin.
* Worked closely with the Gitcoin governance team to qualify leads for potential partnerships.
* Provided strategic insights for the Ajna grants proposal process, engaging in discussions to explore public goods grants administered by Gitcoin.
* Conducted comprehensive reviews and edits on the Ajna proposal to ensure compliance with grant requirements and improve the likelihood of approval.
* Initiated discussions with the Safe Ecosystem Foundation and SafeDAO Governance team regarding the integration of Allo into the Safe Grants Program Wave 2 (scheduled for Q3 2024).
* Launched the scoping process for the Klaytn Community Committee, including Gitcoin representation alongside StableLab as a proposal reviewer.

**June - July 2024**

* Supported Gitcoin in submitting grant applications for Ajna's second funding cycle, both on-chain and off-chain.
* Assisted Gitcoin's application to the OP Grants Council, facilitating connections with other delegates and securing votes.
* Explored the potential integration of Gitcoin‚Äôs Allo with Starknet‚Äôs grant programs, initiating dialogues with key stakeholders at the Starknet Foundation around goals, objectives, and technical requirements.
* Identified new engagement opportunities for Gitcoin, including MODE Network Governance Council participation.
* Investigated potential roles for Gitcoin in managing funding programs for the 1inchDAO and ArbitrumDAO.

**August - October 2024**

* Supported discussions with 1inch about integrating Allo into their funding mechanisms.
* Scoped out strategies to drive GMV for Allo with Starknet and zkSync (TPP).
* Initiated the development of the Livepeer Governance Working Group (GovWork) as Committee Chair, creating another opportunity for Gitcoin to participate once the committee is operational in a few weeks.

### Reflections

While working on our objectives, we observed a noticeable tendency toward entrenchment within existing ecosystem grant programs and their enabling platforms. This can significantly hinder innovation and reduce these programs' responsiveness to the evolving needs of their communities. Many established grant tools, while functional, often adhere to rigid frameworks that can stifle new ideas and limit flexibility in funding approaches.

In contrast, Gitcoin and its suite of solutions distinguish itself in the market through its remarkable adaptability and capacity to support diverse funding mechanisms and programs. Gitcoin, with Allo, enables projects to leverage direct grants, retroactive funding, and quadratic funding, among other strategies. This versatility allows for tailored funding solutions that meet specific project needs and encourages community engagement and participation in the funding process.

### Looking Ahead

As we look ahead, our focus will remain on strengthening our partnerships, expanding Gitcoin‚Äôs footprint within the Web3 ecosystem, and leveraging Gitcoin's versatile service offerings to drive meaningful impact. Our strategic plan includes:

* **Building on Existing Relationships**: We will continue cultivating and enhancing our current partnerships while actively seeking new opportunities that align with our objectives and Gitcoin‚Äôs commitment to supporting public goods and innovative projects.

* **Opportunity Generation**: We will focus on generating new opportunities by going beyond simply supporting existing grant programs. This will involve deeply examining the needs of aligned ecosystems and proposing tailored incentive programs where Gitcoin‚Äôs service offerings can be effectively utilized. 

Your feedback and questions are always welcome as we work towards a more inclusive and dynamic funding landscape.
