https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-budget-request-for-ethdenver-activation/17424
    ## Introduction

We are excited to announce our plans for an exciting and engaging ETHDenver activation. This proposal outlines the budget for the activation, including expenses for events, merchandise, and travel. This proposal aims to be in line with our [2024 IRL Events Plan](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-s-2024-irl-events-plan/17322).


## Events

Below is our scheduled events for the week:

**Tuesday Feb 27 - Grantees Day** @ Gitcoin House (half-day event)

**Wednesday Feb 28 - Metagov Program Managers Day** @ Gitcoin House (private full-day event)

**Thursday Feb 29 - Gitcoin Presents: "Welcome to Denver" Get Together** @ Gitcoin House (half-day event)

**Friday Mar 1 - Ecosystem Growth Summit @ Green Spaces Co-working** (half-day event)

**Saturday Mar 2 - Schelling Point Sessions: Impact Reporting w/ Impact Plus** @ Gitcoin House (half-day event)

**Saturday Mar 2 - Passport Dinner & Whiteboarding** @ Gitcoin House (private evening event)

**Unscheduled - Grants F&&&-up Night** @ Gitcoin House (private evening event)


## Total Budget

The total budget for the ETHDenver activation is $71,750.


### Fund Allocation

**Events:** $44,000



* Metagov Grantees Day ($2,000)
* Metagov Program Managers Day ($4,000)
* Gitcoin "Welcome to Denver" Get Together ($2,000)
* Ecosystem Growth Summit ($30,000 - $15,000 for the event space, $5,000 for food and beverage, $10,000 for production costs)
* Schelling Point Sessions: Impact Reporting ($2,000)
* Passport Dinner & Whiteboard ($2,000)
* Grants F***-up Night ($2,000)


**Merchandise:** $7,750



* Passport merch ($1,500)
* Gitcoin merch ($5,500)
* Stickers ($750)

**Travel reimbursements for individuals running all of the events:** $5,000

**Gitcoin House:** $15,000

* House cost (50% Gitcoin, 50% WEST Group): $14,000
* Cleaning service between events: $950
* Event insurance: $50


## Sponsorships

There are several conversations happening around sponsorships. Should there be any additional funds raised from sponsorships, those funds will go directly to offsetting these costs.


## Return of Funds

It is very likely that most of these event costs will come under what has been budgeted. The last thing we want is to have a bill that is higher than what has been request, so many of these estimates have been rounded up, with the expectations of creating wiggle room in our budget for unforeseen expenses (which tends to be an inevitability when running events).

The team is also 100% committed to being prudent with any spend, only using the DAO's treasury for mission critical items. 

**Any leftover funds from the activation budget will be returned to the Gitcoin treasury.**


## Voting Options

If the vote is successful, funds can either be sent to the MMM multisig (since MMM is responsible for most of the planning).

* Yes, fund the full EthDenver activation for $56,750
* No, do not fund the full EthDenver activation for $56,750
* Abstain

            <p>Thanks for the cost breakdown <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/coachjonathan">@CoachJonathan</a> appreciate the level of detail that went into this.</p>
<p>Would love to see learnings highlighted in your next retro. Specifically, what worked and didn‚Äôt work about each event (if that feels safe to share). What would you repeat? What would you not repeat?</p>
<p>I‚Äôd also love to help map objectives and track against those for our events so we understand what our targets are and report against them specifically.</p>
<p>One more thing: IKYK, I‚Äôm really bullish in experimenting with revenue generation for our events and also making them more sticky w/ time-boxed GTC or ETH staking to help improve attendance metrics.</p>
<p>Thanks for all you and <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/quaylawn">@quaylawn</a> do. I heard Denver was a huge success!</p>

[Proposal] Budget Request for ETHDenver Activation
CoachJonathan

            <p>Hi everyone, I wanted to provide an update on EthDenver, the results of our activations and spend.</p>
<h3><a name="tldr-1" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#tldr-1"></a>TLDR</h3>
<ul>
<li>Original request = $71,750</li>
<li>Total expenditures = $75,248</li>
<li>Total sponsorships = $31,000</li>
<li>Total cost to Gitcoin = $44,248</li>
<li>Amount being returned to Gitcoin = $27,502</li>
</ul>
<p>From a qualitative standpoint, all of our events were well received and well attended. We had a difficult time getting feedback (as many of these events do) and are still waiting for more to trickle in.</p>
<p>Costs indicated below are approximates. There are many costs that are divided between all events, such as several costs for the Gitcoin House (doorman, cleaning service, insurance, the house itself which also served as accommodation for 8 people, etc.), merch, food/drink purchases, travel costs, etc. that were spread across multiple days.</p>
<p>Below are the activations we hosted and some of the associated statistics.</p>
<p><em>Note: Though impressions on Twitter tend to be a vanity metrics, it gives us a quick pulse check on how many folks were scrolling through their feeds and over our grants-centric content.</em></p>

            <p>Really excited for this events activation. We‚Äôve worked hard to coordinate with the Grants Stack and BD teams to make sure that this is aligned to their goals. Most of what we have here are field marketing initiatives mixed with a sprinkle of Gitcoin vibe events that we know and love.</p>
<p>Am really keen to get feedback on the effectiveness of this initiative to actually meet product adoption goals. <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/coachjonathan">@CoachJonathan</a> can you and <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/quaylawn">@quaylawn</a> make sure that there is a post mortem so we can work to make these effective this year?</p>

            <p>All IRL activations for 2024 will align with the <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-s-2024-irl-events-plan/17322">Event Strategy outline</a> I shared in the gov forum. Apologies for not sharing this in the OP - I have adjusted it to include this link.</p>
<p>For product-focused events, ROI will mostly be tracked on the basis of the number of leads and opportunities generated at events.</p>
<p>For brand activations, ROI is much more difficult to track and we‚Äôll mostly be focused on feedback surveys.</p>
<p>I agree re: small budget activations - these tend to be super high value for Gitcoin &amp; everyone attending. The majority of our activations will be like this with the exception of our Ecosystem Growth Summit.</p>

            <p>No objections from my side on the additional costs</p>
<p>DAOs usually plan in quarter or 6 months</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-events-sponsorship-budget/15075" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">[ARFC] Aave Events &amp; Sponsorship Budget - Governance - Aave</a></li>

</ul>
<p>The question is what is the goal from doing events? Is it PR? Fundraising? Parties? Increasing token utility? etc‚Ä¶ Once the DAO is clear on the one thing they want to optimize for from their events budget, they can plan in well advance and measure the RoI for each event compared to the previous year as well as with other events. With this experimentation it is possible to find out the best return on investment from event budgets. As an example, I run an events project in BanklessDAO on a shoestring budget and we figured out that small events have ridiculously high returns in terms of engagement and partnership building as compared to main stream events.</p>

[Proposal] Budget Request for ETHDenver Activation
CoachJonathan

            <p>Hey everyone, oversight on my side - I did not include the cost of the Gitcoin House where we will be hosting the majority of our events. My apologies.</p>
<p>This cost comes out to $15k for the week and has been added into the total. This will also serve to offset accommodation expenses for several members of the Gitcoin team that will be in town doing talks or running events.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/jengajojo">@jengajojo</a> <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/thedevanshmehta">@thedevanshmehta</a> <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/quaylawn">@quaylawn</a> <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a> please make sure to comment if these costs no longer seem reasonable to you. Otherwise I will assume this budget still has your approval.</p>

<p>I do remember you mentioning some Gitcoin merch wasn‚Äôt able to reach Istanbul due to customs. Is that forever stranded in Turkey or is there a possibility of getting it back so we can reuse it here?</p>

<p>Is there some cosponsorship from the MetaGov team or is this a branding event for them on our dime?</p>

<p>I do know Jonas was keen on this idea so sharing the cost with them would be ideal if we can manage that.</p>
<p>Overall I vote yes as leftover funds will be returned and I trust the team to be prudent</p>

            <p>Generally in favor of this proposal and looking forward to seeing many of you in Denver. It would be good to have long term view of event budgets and their resulting quantifiable RoI as opposed to individual asks for each event</p>

            <p>I think that this proposal is in line with the <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/update-gitcoin-s-ratified-essential-intents-2023-2024-and-a-recap-of-our-successes/16818">2024 Essential Intents</a>, especially Community First and Product Adoption (which leads to Network Effects), and so I will be voting yes on this proposal.</p>

<h2><a name="events-2" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#events-2"></a>Events</h2>
<p>Below is our scheduled events for the week:</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday Feb 27 - Grantees Day</strong> @ Gitcoin House (half-day event)</p>

<h2><a name="total-budget-3" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#total-budget-3"></a>Total Budget</h2>
<p>The total budget for the ETHDenver activation is $71,750.</p>
<h3><a name="fund-allocation-4" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#fund-allocation-4"></a>Fund Allocation</h3>
<p><strong>Events:</strong> $44,000</p>
<ul>
<li>Metagov Grantees Day ($2,000)</li>
<li>Metagov Program Managers Day ($4,000)</li>
<li>Gitcoin ‚ÄúWelcome to Denver‚Äù Get Together ($2,000)</li>
<li>Ecosystem Growth Summit ($30,000 - $15,000 for the event space, $5,000 for food and beverage, $10,000 for production costs)</li>
<li>Schelling Point Sessions: Impact Reporting ($2,000)</li>
<li>Passport Dinner &amp; Whiteboard ($2,000)</li>
<li>Grants F***-up Night ($2,000)</li>

<ul>
<li>Passport merch ($1,500)</li>
<li>Gitcoin merch ($5,500)</li>
<li>Stickers ($750)</li>

</ul>
<h2><a name="sponsorships-5" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#sponsorships-5"></a>Sponsorships</h2>
<p>There are several conversations happening around sponsorships. Should there be any additional funds raised from sponsorships, those funds will go directly to offsetting these costs.</p>
<h2><a name="return-of-funds-6" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#return-of-funds-6"></a>Return of Funds</h2>
<p>It is very likely that most of these event costs will come under what has been budgeted. The last thing we want is to have a bill that is higher than what has been request, so many of these estimates have been rounded up, with the expectations of creating wiggle room in our budget for unforeseen expenses (which tends to be an inevitability when running events).</p>
<p>The team is also 100% committed to being prudent with any spend, only using the DAO‚Äôs treasury for mission critical items.</p>
<p><strong>Any leftover funds from the activation budget will be returned to the Gitcoin treasury.</strong></p>
<h2><a name="voting-options-7" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#voting-options-7"></a>Voting Options</h2>
<p>If the vote is successful, funds can either be sent to the MMM multisig (since MMM is responsible for most of the planning).</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, fund the full EthDenver activation for $56,750</li>
<li>No, do not fund the full EthDenver activation for $56,750</li>
<li>Abstain</li>
