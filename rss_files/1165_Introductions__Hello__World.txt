    Hey everyone. Great to be part of this beginning. May the forum become an awesome place for us to engage and work on the mission to build the Open Web..:slight_smile: 

I propose we introduce ourselves with a small format like this:

* **I am:** Beginner Etherean from the Land of the Tiger.
* **On Gitcoin Since**: GR8.
* **My Aim:** Contribute to actually building something

Here is to great adventures ahead.
