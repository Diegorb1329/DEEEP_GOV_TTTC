            <p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/meglister">@meglister</a> Thank you for this insightful, detailed summary. Shipping products seems to be a core focus. I have seen evidence of some products appearing in other ecosystems, primarily passport.xyz.</p>
<p>As a Gitcoin Steward are there resources compiled in a single view that I can leverage to learn more about the mechanics of available products that could benefit other ecosystems? As an example, I have fair knowledge about Superfluid bc I was a beneficiary during GG20. In terms of Gitcoin products I have a firm understanding of passport.xyz, <a href="http://builder.gitcoin.co" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">builder.gitcoin.co</a>, and <a href="http://explorer.gitcoin.co" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">explorer.gitcoin.co</a>. That is where my knowledge base ends though.</p>
<p>Appreciate your review and consideration.</p>
