The post sheds light on some of the challenges, and presents useful frameworks like the Socio-Technical Frequency Map to assist in compartmentalizing and operationalizing workstreams.

* [Partnership & Mutual Grant with Prime DAO](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-partnership-mutual-grant-with-prime-dao/9330) by [Vishnu](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/vgk) is a proposal that, if passed, ‚Äúwould grant Gitcoin $250K USD worth of PrimeDAO‚Äôs $D2D governance token at a price of $0.50 per token for a total of 500K $D2D coins, equating to 0.5% of Prime DAO treasury. The purpose of this alliance is to help ensure that Gitcoin and Prime can work together to build tooling for DAO2DAO coordination.‚Äù

## [üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Workstream Discussion](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/workstream-discussion/9)

### üå± [Public Goods Funding](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Public-Goods-Funding-80a3202a3a244c65b3fda08c0f7c7d60)

* [Grants Round 12](https://gitcoin.co/blog/announcing-grants-round-12/) went live last week, with over $3m in matching pool funding from a variety of ecosystem partners like ENS, Ethereum Foundation, and NounsDAO.

* [NounsDAO](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-a-very-nounish-gitcoinmas-nft-crossover-event-169-eth-to-crypto-public-goods/369) in particular has committed one of the largest single amounts of funding ever at 169 ETH, with a special NounsBot auction set to happen later this week.

* Moreover, PGF successfully set up [over 10 rounds in total for GR12](https://gitcoin.co/blog/announcing-grants-round-12/), including three cause rounds focusing on advocacy, climate, and longevity.

* The public library and public goods PR squads continue to push forward on helping promote and expand the discourse around public goods; Aya from the Ethereum Foundation and a number of other exciting speakers are coming up!

* We‚Äôve continued to solidify partnerships with groups like DeveloperDAO, Verses, and more.

### [üöÄ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-prototyping-workstream-moonshot-budget-request-q4-2021/8785) [Moonshot Collective](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Moonshot-Collective-ffa78f44a0de412cb607f9b69d3a376f)

* [The GreatestLARP](https://greatestlarp.com/final-battle), Level 4 is Live! We gathered our 200 member ETHBot army in Level 2. We captured 200 mini-Molochs in Level 3. Now The Final Battle is upon us! Help defeat Moloch one last time while raising funds for public goods.

* To beat Level 4 we must crowdfund 100 ETH to unlock the super-rare 1/1 Battle NFT through [PartyBid](https://www.partybid.app/party/0xA2db0A5687F7c1F685e2E62a917b40E3133B3D8E). Not only will you help slay Moloch, the NFT will be tokenized and distributed to participants based on contribution percentage.

* The GreatestLARP has already raised approximately $500K for public goods so far, with the opportunity to raise hundreds of thousands more. Let‚Äôs coordinate to take down Moloch!

### üåê [Decentralize Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Decentralize-Gitcoin-c3197f918bf640bc9809cd26d56c93f3)

* The on-chain proposal for dCompass Q4 budget has passed [quorum on Tally](https://www.withtally.com/governance/gitcoin/proposal/11). [Huxwell](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/Huxwell) gave an [update on dCompass](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-integrate-dcompass-within-dgitcoin-to-build-dquests-dknowledge/8836/16) and what's being worked on. A [grant for dCompass](https://grants.gtcdao.net/#/dgrants/5?roundAddress=0xa94E824ac0907c1Db5145F7fDb326A8bBfCa5599&roundName=Gitcoin+Building+Gitcoin) is also now live on the Gitcoin building dGitcoin GR12-round.

* We are currently about half way through GR12 and we feel good about our progress!
  * We have 19 approved grants on the platform with 15 of those in the Gitcoin Building Gitcoin round
  * There have been a total of 586 contributions to grants on the platform
  * The total USD value of donations is around $2k which puts is quite a ways away from our goal of $15k so we are working to increase that!
* We currently have a review process but it is slower than we would like for turnaround and we are working with the FDD workstream to tighten the time frame.

* We are looking to create a dashboard with stats for dGrants.

* We have had a number of reports of feedback and issues from our users and we greatly appreciate the feedback! We have worked hard to quickly resolve any issues.

### üíô [Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Fraud-Detection-Defense-f1a2969a9f324f57a02ef69a60b25cae)

* Operations
  * Season 2 | Epoch 3 & 4 contributor payments are out!
  * We are sending the new DAOops stream the remaining budgets for DAOops ($83,616k) & User Support ($61.235).
  * FDD treasury diversification has begun with 25k GTC being used for Stablecoin & ETH purchases over the next few weeks.
  * FDD is also modeling a non-transferrable governance token for FDD to start in Q1 2021. This will help us achieve our progressive decentralization goals outlined in the [Q3-Q4 2021 State of FDD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uEuGe5OOecLyAsLbgnqaLplaH8ycU4zej3c-mv6QHTI/edit?usp=sharing) deliverables.
* Sybil Detection
  * Join our ecosystem sybil detection roadmap event on Monday the 13th at 3pm UTC (10am EST). Presentations from Blockscience, Omnianalytics, and an overview of the decentralized Proof-of-Personhood Passport offerings to the web 3 community and how we will get there. This is connected to our GR12 events covering last weeks [A Community Based Sybil Detection Roadmap](https://gitcoin.co/blog/a-community-based-roadmap-for-sybil-detection-across-web-3/) blog post.
  * Friday we held the first of 5 sybil hunt evaluation parties. By rewarding DAO contributors for participating in giving their opinion on accounts the ml algorithm flags as sybil, we are able to minimize bias and continually train the algorithms to think like the Gitcoin community and less like it‚Äôs builders.
  * This week contributor Dries built out data anonymization process for the community algorithm.
* Grant Eligibility & Policy
  * A new squad with cross-functional input from FDD Policy, FDD Grant Approvals, & PG Grants Ops named Grant Investigation Agency started work designing a publicly run Grant Disputes adjudication process using Ethelo software. Deliverable will be adjudication of all GR12 grants disputes using the new process and criteria considerations.
  * Maintaining a single source of truth for policy on the new dCompass open source knowledge base is a priority. Working across all streams to find a home for the knowledge base maintenance with DAOops.
  * The FDD Grant Approvals squad has new grant approvals posted during GR12 being handled at an average of 12 hours as of Monday, Dec. 6th.
* Research
  * [TE Governauts DAO Compensation Open Science Program](https://twitter.com/tokengineering/status/1467924648717430784) is in full swing with 5 Gitcoin DAO researchers participating!
  * Growth & Experimentation is looking at squad health & playbooks for how to start a new squad. What considerations need to be made? What tools are there to help the squad achieve their goals?
  * Risks & Threats has begun formal research into sybil attacker profiles so we may better understand how to best defend the grants mechanism. Ops Sec is another path we are just beginning to turn our attention towards.

### üé® [Merch, Memes & Marketing](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Memes-Merch-Marketing-c1bd89fac8ab4569bf2a676df28025d8)

<li>Join our ecosystem sybil detection roadmap event on Monday the 13th at 3pm UTC (10am EST). Presentations from Blockscience, Omnianalytics, and an overview of the decentralized Proof-of-Personhood Passport offerings to the web 3 community and how we will get there. This is connected to our GR12 events covering last weeks <a href="https://gitcoin.co/blog/a-community-based-roadmap-for-sybil-detection-across-web-3/">A Community Based Sybil Detection Roadmap</a> blog post.</li>
<li>Friday we held the first of 5 sybil hunt evaluation parties. By rewarding DAO contributors for participating in giving their opinion on accounts the ml algorithm flags as sybil, we are able to minimize bias and continually train the algorithms to think like the Gitcoin community and less like it‚Äôs builders.</li>
<li>This week contributor Dries built out data anonymization process for the community algorithm.</li>

<li>Grant Eligibility &amp; Policy
<ul>
<li>A new squad with cross-functional input from FDD Policy, FDD Grant Approvals, &amp; PG Grants Ops named Grant Investigation Agency started work designing a publicly run Grant Disputes adjudication process using Ethelo software. Deliverable will be adjudication of all GR12 grants disputes using the new process and criteria considerations.</li>
<li>Maintaining a single source of truth for policy on the new dCompass open source knowledge base is a priority. Working across all streams to find a home for the knowledge base maintenance with DAOops.</li>
<li>The FDD Grant Approvals squad has new grant approvals posted during GR12 being handled at an average of 12 hours as of Monday, Dec. 6th.</li>
