    **Name of Proposed Round**

Ma Earth Grants Round 

Funding for regenerative land projects.
@maearthmedia
maearth.eth


**How many times has this round been run during a Gitcoin Grants round?**

This is our first Ma Earth Grants Round. It‚Äôs an outgrowth of philanthropic grant-making by Biome Trust: https://biometrust.earth. 

We have also been publishing an interview series featuring leading voices from the regenerative economy, and will use this audience to help get the word out: https://maearth.com 


**How big is your team that will run this round? Who is your team?**

* Matthew Monahan - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/matthewmutual) / [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewmonahan/) - completed the Grants Stack Round Manager training
* Andre Bate - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-bate-b63b621b/) - experienced at running fellowship selection programmes
* Catlin Powers - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catlinpowers/) - solar energy entrepreneur and board trustee
* Jan Hania - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-hania-19634b33/) - MƒÅori conservation leader and foundation director
 
 
**How does this round align with Gitcoin‚Äôs mission and essential intents?**

The Ma Earth Grants Round is designed to support communities in funding and protecting their natural ecosystems and ecological commons. 

By leveraging our existing relationship network of land projects, we can help bring values-aligned communities onchain and into the Gitcoin ecosystem for the first time.

As an established charitable foundation, we also have established networks with other funders and foundations. We aspire for our work to be a demonstration of the value of quadratic funding and Web3 tooling, and to help onboard other funders into future rounds across the Gitcoin ecosystem.


**What do you anticipate the size of the matching pool will be?**

Biome Trust is contributing US $100,000 to the matching pool for this round.

Funding address: 0xE9aaCeD9a50c79C10CdCBb943f0731d0e7AC6BBa


**Who will be advisors for this round, if anyone?**

The wider Biome Trust community will be involved in advising the round: [https://biometrust.earth/about](https://biometrust.earth/about)


**Please describe the eligibility criteria you envision for this proposed round.**

* Place-based land projects, such as regenerative farms, eco villages, bioregional conservation, indigenous communities, and environmental education centers.

* Ecologically regenerative activities, such as: tree planting, conservation easements, invasive species management, seed saving, wetland restoration, soil testing, biodiversity monitoring, renewable energy installations, and community gardens.

* All rounds must comply with Gitcoin‚Äôs core rules, which include no fraudulent activity, quid pro quo, hate speech, or other activities out of alignment with Gitcoin‚Äôs essential intents.


**How large is your community approximately?**

We have active relationships with roughly 100 environmental nonprofits and land projects around the world. We are based in Aotearoa New Zealand and also have strong networks in the United States. 

Our Ma Earth interview series audience is reaching thousands of people per month across social media channels.

We also have ten years of community networks and experience from our own regenerative land project, Mangaroa Farms ([https://mangaroa.org](https://mangaroa.org)).


**What type of projects would you like to fund?**

We are funding place-based, regenerative land projects that will help protect and restore ecosystems for the thriving of life on Earth. 

We are choosing to focus this grants round on place-based projects, and not including intermediary environmental and advocacy groups at this time.

You can see the types of projects we've supported in the past here: [https://biometrust.earth/gifts](https://biometrust.earth/gifts)


**Approximately how many grantees do you believe will be eligible to apply to this round?**

Since it‚Äôs our first round on the Gitcoin platform, we‚Äôre planning to keep the number of grantees tight, to approximately 10-20 projects, depending on the final applications we receive. We want to make sure we can deliver a high quality experience, especially since many of our grantees will be new to Web3 and crypto.

**Impact Assessment: If and how do you intend to assess grantee impact over successive rounds? This could include, but is not limited to Hypercerts, GAP, Deresy, etc.**

We are working to implement Hypercerts for scalable impact assessment, along with leading MRV (Measuring, Reporting, and Verification) providers to measure relevant ecological outomes (e.g. carbon, biodiversity, and water quality). 

We will ask grantees to provide a summary of activities and impact, including when applying for subsequent rounds. We have a network of ecological advisors and experts to support us as needed in determining quality of outcomes.


**Is there anything else that community members should consider when voting for which rounds to focus on in the upcoming GG20 grants round?**

We are grateful to the Gitcoin community for continuing to provide tools and systems to support innovative funding models. We see this as a pillar of the future of philanthropic giving, and we are looking to use our rounds as a case study with other nonprofit foundations and donors. If successful, we also plan to commit more of our endowment to future grants rounds.

Part of our mission is also to support regenerative land projects getting onchain for the first time. We‚Äôve started creating a series of tutorials and help documentation to this aim. [Work in progress](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiGbQorGoKxDBjWed_gcIuKU7EgXlLx33&feature=shared).

We welcome any additional funds for the matching pool, as we believe in the importance of the work being done by grantees. That said, our primary motivation here is for the general visibility and support that would come from inclusion as a Gitcoin Community Round.

            <p>Hi! Thanks for the question. Yes you‚Äôd need to redeploy your round on Arbitrum. And no problem! Our product team can hide the Optimism round for you if you provide me with the URL. Please also <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/thriving-gg20-thank-arb-and-gitcoin/18565">check out this post</a> as there might be additional matching funds available from Arbitrum for you!</p>
<p>I‚Äôll also get in touch with you for marketing efforts that we could support in. I‚Äôll DM you now</p>

            <p>Hi MathildaDV, we already deployed our round last night, and haven‚Äôt received applications yet. We are getting feedback that it‚Äôd be better to switch from Optimism to Arbitrum, given what everyone else is doing. Do you know if there‚Äôs a way to stop/delete/halt a round? I can‚Äôt find any options in the Grants Manager to stop it, and don‚Äôt want to duplicate it on Arbitrum if that‚Äôs going to create confusion.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your support, wasn‚Äôt sure if there‚Äôs a better place to ask this.</p>
