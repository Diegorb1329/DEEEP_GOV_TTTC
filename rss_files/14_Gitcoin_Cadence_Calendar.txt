    ## Dao Cadence Updates


### Overview

Welcome to Gitcoinâ€™s Cadenceâ€”a comprehensive guide that outlines various DAO wide activities throughout the year. This post serves as a roadmap for community members, detailing when and how you can expect updates from the buidlers and crew @ Gitcoin. From setting wide-reaching goals to budget approvals and Steward Council elections, this cadence is designed to keep you informed, engaged, and empowered. Your voice matters, and this guide is your roadmap to making an impact.


### Why an Annual Cadence?

In the spirit of our ongoing commitment to transparency, accountability, and community-led decision-making, weâ€™ll be rolling out (and constantly updating) some of the key events and communications within the DAO. This calendar serves as a guide for the multitude of activities we'll undertake throughout the year. It's designed to keep youâ€”our most important partnersâ€”informed, engaged, and empowered.

### Your Role in the Cadence

We invite each and every one of you to give feedback on when we are actioning things, suggest improvements or let us know what other items should be on this list. Your voice matters, and this cadence serves as a guide for when and how you can make the most impact.

This cadence is our commitment to transparent, inclusive, and effective governance. We look forward to your active participation as we continue to shape our decentralized future together. GTC is the token that binds us together, and as we expand its use, it will continue to be used for governance over our most important things, but we have an opportunity to ensure those who are most vested in our ecosystem can also reinforce the outcomes that matter most to them.

Feel free to share your thoughts, questions, and feedback. We're all ears!
