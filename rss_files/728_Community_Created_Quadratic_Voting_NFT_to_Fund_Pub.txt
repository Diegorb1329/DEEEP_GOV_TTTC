    In 2017, a social experiment was launched on Reddit in the form of a subreddit called "place", which contained a collaborative pixel art canvas, where a user could place a pixel every five minutes. The resulting artwork (and time lapse https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnRCZK3KjUY) was both stunning and an insightful look at social cooperation on the internet. 

I think it would be extremely interesting to create a pixel art canvas that utilizes quadratic voting to determine pixel color and in which the 90% of funds used in voting are directed to Gitcoin's treasury to fund grants, and 10% go to the creators. The artwork could ultimately be listed as well and sold for the same purposes. I haven't made an official proposal yet, because I'm interested in getting feedback on this idea. Let me know as well if this is something you might be interested in contributing to.
