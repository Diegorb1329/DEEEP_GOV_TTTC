https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-dao-week-in-governance-edition-9/8422
    This weekly post has the ambition to summarize what‚Äôs been going on in the Gitcoin DAO Governance. Topics, ideas, proposals, and votes will be listed with links for further reading and discussion. If there‚Äôs anything missing please reach out! üìù

### [ü§ñ Meta-Governance](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/governance-meta/6)

* The discussion on the [proposal to issue CLR.Fund a 40k GTC Grant](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-issue-clr-fund-a-40k-gtc-grant/8240) is ongoing with questions and answers by both the authors @lefterisjp and @auryn providing further details ([1](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-issue-clr-fund-a-40k-gtc-grant/8240/16), [2](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-issue-clr-fund-a-40k-gtc-grant/8240/17), [3](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-issue-clr-fund-a-40k-gtc-grant/8240/22)) on how the funding will be used.
* After an inflow of users demanding GTC airdrops on Discord @owocki authored a [thread](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-to-adjust-code-of-conduct-wrt-airdrops/8383) to adjust the [Gitcoin Code of Conduct](https://support.gitcoin.co/kb/article/42-code-of-conduct/) WRT Airdrops. The discussion is active in the thread with arguments on both sides, @tra38 argued for [banning airdrops entirely](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-to-adjust-code-of-conduct-wrt-airdrops/8383/6).
* @james authored a [proposal ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-round-11-matching-pool-allocations/8386)on the behalf of üî•_üî• to ‚Äúdiscuss and finalize how funding allocations from the Gitcoin Grants Round 11 Matching Pool are distributed. After a successful Grants Round 10 proposal this proposal aims to continue to drive forward community-owned decisions on Gitcoin Grants rounds.‚Äù
