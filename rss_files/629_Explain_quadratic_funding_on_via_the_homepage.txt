    I'd like to open a discussion for making the explanation of quadratic funding much more prominent on the Gitcoin website. The term is used several times in the testimonials on the homepage, but without explanation.

I believe there should be a prominent (link to the) explanation on the homepage, and that not having it leads to a higher bounce rate.

I've navigated gitcoin.co quite a bit, but the only way I managed to find [the explanation of Quadratic Funding](https://qf.gitcoin.co/) was by using Google Search with `site:gitcoin.co`. The homepage doesn't seem to link to https://gitcoin.co/fund or to https://qf.gitcoin.co/.

            <p>Actually Quadratic funding is not invented by Gitcoin, but implemented by Gitcoin.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the feedback!</p>
<p>We have a microsite we own: <a href="http://wtfisqf.com">http://wtfisqf.com</a></p>
<p>We can make this more known I suspect too. (perhaps in the about us, or mission pages)</p>
