    Season 15 is here, and voting is now live for a number of workstreams. Lots of stewards are putting together voter's guides. I want to offer my guide here for these interested, and ideally turn this into a single thread where others can post their guide. I will work to add each newly published guide to this first post to prevent lots of scrolling through the thread.

            <p>These are really comprehensive, look like a TON of work, and I would find very useful to understand the budget proposals.  I also appreciate the transparency where there could be a perceived conflict of interest and the resulting abstinence.  Thank you.</p>
