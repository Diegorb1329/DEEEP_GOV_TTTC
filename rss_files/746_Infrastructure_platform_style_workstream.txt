Infrastructure/platform style workstream?
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/infrastructure-platform-style-workstream/4000
    Curious if there is a need for a workstream related to infrastructure / platform/ ops type of work.
For example work related to one of the following technologies:
1. Ansible
2. Terraform
3. Docker/docker compose/ kubernetes

Or similiar.

Thanks.
