    As Gitcoin progressively becomes a decentralized ecosystem, there will be many properties that are created by partner projects / partner communities ....

Because not all of these will be linked on gitcoin.co navigation, I feel that it will be hard to track this evolving diaspora of apps/resources built on top of Gitcoin.  

So I put together a list of all of them.

Here it is [https://ecosystem.gitcoin.co/](https://ecosystem.gitcoin.co/).

The resource is open source - Feel free to fork it + issue a pull request back for any resources I missed.
