            <p>What has happened in Turkey (and Syria, which was oddly left off) is an absolute human tragedy on an unfathomable scale.  But GitcoinDAO is not a charity.  A dedicated QF round could be appropriate, not direct donations from the DAO.</p>

            <p>This is absolutely a tragedy and I don‚Äôt mind at all that you‚Äôve posted a request for help here. I‚Äôd encourage everyone to chip in.</p>
<p>I am unsure if this is simply a request for donations from individuals (and maybe Gitcoin if it was possible) or if you are looking for assistance in dispersing the funds.</p>
<p>As for the request, here is my <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x68266d99d27ecf371cfe575c388dc03eeeefc58e701854e20de9c557c8be4473">contribution</a></p>
<p>Additionally, I‚Äôd love to work with a designer from the Turkish community to create 3 tiers of POAPs</p>
<p>Tier 1 - $10 or more<br>
Tier 2 - $100 or more<br>
Tier 3 - $1,000 or more</p>
<p>We can work with the POAP team and FDD analysts to retroactively send out the POAPs to anyone who donates to the addresses above or to a specific gitcoin donation address if preferred. That might be better.</p>
<p>What does everyone think about this plan?</p>

            <p>Thank you Connor,</p>
<p>we all are very emotional because of the past few days, seeing and living the tragedy of the earthquake around us and try to solve things as fast as possible.</p>
<p>How can we stay on top of this and start the process in march should we remind you again or will you get back to us?</p>

            <p>Our new platform is going through some fixes and as such, we can‚Äôt run any more matching rounds until March - that said, if there is still a need (and I imagine there will be), I would be behind working to set up a specific matching pool in the March cohort of ‚Äútest rounds‚Äù we‚Äôre planning for causes specifically supporting the earthquake relief efforts. Do you think that would still help support those in need?</p>

            <p>Thanks for your response Kris. Afaik, I got the impression that Gitcoin is not willing to move this initiative to a DAO vote on Snapshot. If that is the case, would you please close this thread and in return, if you could just pin it so that at least individual donations may still continue?</p>
<p>And I do know how to create a Grant on Gitcoin for sure. This was just a temperature check submitted to the Gitcoin DAO to see if there‚Äôs enough support for some kind of a matching fund for further collaboration with this funding effort.</p>
