    Gm Gitcoin community, meet Public Good Africa - PGA!

It‚Äôs Grant season, we will be brief; we promiseü§ûüèæ

# Overview

We are excited to announce PGA to this lovely community. PGA is a deliberate effort to ignite a new era of public good in Africa. We are creating a mechanism where funding, collaboration and impact converge to enable web3 to meet one of its noblest potential - empowering Africa!

# Specification

We are building in two folds üë∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèóÔ∏è

* A platform to aggregate impact across Africa and integrate Gitcoin technologies to run QF rounds. This will enable anyone to discover impacts across the continent easily. It‚Äôs also a great way of connecting these impacts to various Public Good Funding opportunities.

* A coordination mechanism(community, education etc) to raise Africa‚Äôs collective consciousness about the power of Public Goods and Public Goods Funding in fostering innovation, impact and creating positive externalities.

Exciting Update üì∞

* We have been seeded with 5k USD from Owocki to run a QF round for Public Goods in Africa. This will be the first of its kind. We are extremely grateful, thank you @owocki 
* We have been communicating with @jon-spark-eco since the launch of PGA, who has been an absolute public great in guiding us through a series of important steps.
* We have synced with the Quadratic Avengers ü´°ü´°

We are excited for the future of Public Goods in Africa and the world.

And, that‚Äôs it, back to impacting.üòâ

</aside>
<p>Through my work at the <a href="https://twitter.com/Solar_FND" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Solar Foundation</a> I have learned just how powerful the crypto tools we are all building are for people in Africa. Borderless money, defi tools for the unbanked, DiD, and new funding mechanisms are just a few tools that can empower people and fund their vision. The potential for these tools to coordinate capital and impact across the African continent is extraordinary. I look forward to supporting PGA in this round and into the future.</p>
