    ## Introducing v2 of the Steward Council & future plans

## tl;dr

This update seeks to inform the community about the results of a Steward Council v1 retroactive assessment, outline key priority areas for v2 of the Steward Council, and to announce the members of the Steward Council for the next 180 days.

For background, you can explore the initial proposal [introducing the Steward Council here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-the-steward-council/9485/11), as well as the [The Steward Council - Formation & Mandate ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-steward-council-formation-mandate/9843) here.

This update is split into the following sections:

* Steward Council v1 Retroactive
* Announcing members of the v2 Stewards Council

## Steward Council v1 Retroactive results

The Steward Council was authorized via the [The Steward Council Election & Mandate](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0x5784ba66b16153b15cd2b94625909cb1b4ee7d1c6b5f033b30d037fa90140db9) snapshot vote on March 11, 2022 for 180 days. As the period closes on September 7, 2022, and to prepare for the next session, a retro was conducted to capture lessons learned and identify areas of improvement.

The results are captured in this [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UnfCV3JVniGQlhy52QaEC6a8B1ZIx0cTCopRMGEq82g/edit?usp=sharing), but can be summarized in terms of what was done well, and what work still needs to be completed. Data was collected via one-on-one interviews, a qualitative survey, and a 1 hour review with the Stewards Council. The data collected, the input from the surveys, as well as a recording of the working group are all captured in the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UnfCV3JVniGQlhy52QaEC6a8B1ZIx0cTCopRMGEq82g/edit?usp=sharing).

What worked well:

* We found a way to judiciously get the right people on the council
* We built a respectful and professional group to debate difficult topics
* We delivered a container and cadence for getting to a workable budget
* The team standardized the budget building process making a big difference
* We were able to identify the most important concerns

One of the key outputs from the retro was to identify what work still needed to be done, and what (if any) adjustments still need to be made. Through the discussions and a quick voting mechanism - we identified the list below:

The work to be completed:

* Continue refining/simplifying the budgeting process
* Clarify and optimize how members roll in and out of the Stewards council
* Migrate topics to ‚Äúboard level‚Äù strategic discussions vs. tactical recommendations
* Update and refine the mandate of the Steward council, incl remuneration of its members
* Revise the steward health cards & Steward Council selection algorithm

Additionally, it should be noted that DAO Operation have identified the following related OKRs which will be delivered by the Governance team during Season 15:

* KR1: Create a clearly understood onboarding and incentivization process.
* KR2: Launch a Governance Documentation Hub for new and existing stewards.
* KR3: 80% of stewards and workstream leads view steward meeting structure, pacing and content favorably.
* KR4: 80% of top stewards vote on 100% of formal S15 proposals.

## Announcing members of the v2 Stewards Council

Recall this council looks to elevate the participation of the most engaged stewards as exemplified by the engagement scorecards and looking at stewards with a rating above 8/10. There have been no changes in the Steward Council selection methodology for now. For background, the current methodology is documented [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-steward-health-cards-2-0/10418) and revised [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-steward-council-formation-mandate/9843).

In future, we do plan to continue improving the steward health cards including proposals related to the Steward Council selection process, but no changes were made in this selection.

The current lineup of Stewards with scores of 8/10 or over during the past 180 days is as follows:

* **DisruptionJoe** 
* **kyle** 
* **Fishbiscuit** 
* @bobjiang 
* @lefterisjp 
* @Pop 
* @krrisis 
* @linda 
* @Jodi_GitcoinDAO 
* @Sirlupinwatson 
* @David_Dyor 
* @tjayrush 
* @ZER8 

This second Steward Council will be active until March 06, 2023 following the 180 day period as laid out in [this original post](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-steward-council-formation-mandate/9843). This Council will take us through the end of Season 16, and comfortably into Season 17 before transition. If there are any adjustments to the current format or mandate, those changes will be brought to a community vote.

Finally, we would like to express our appreciation and gratitude to all the Stewards for their contributions to our first Council - both those who will remain on the Council, and those who are departing. You developed a professional working group that has made a significant contribution to the success of Gitcoin, and we thank you.

We are looking forward to your comments. If you are interested in becoming a Steward and potentially joining the next Stewards council, you can apply [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-stewards-governance/41).

Thanks very much to your comments on this post - the results of your input has been captured in a new proposal linked below.   It would be great if you can review that proposal and provide any feedback.  We think this is a solid proposal, but we are counting on you to help make it even better.</p>

In May of 2021 Gitcoin launched GTC, the native governance token for Gitcoin. Along with the creation of GTC, the governance of Gitcoin was handed over to the community via a group of individuals known as Stewards. Stewards are trusted community leaders with delegated (including self-delegated) voting power to make decisions on behalf of the community. 
To support a move towards more active and engaged governance participation, and recognizing governance took a significant amount of tim‚Ä¶

            <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/shawn16400">@shawn16400</a> and others for all the hard work on the draft. It‚Äôs great to see more structure in the council and stipends for contribution. I think it‚Äôs a positive step in the right direction.</p>
<p>I will remain a delegate for Gitcoin DAO but <strong>I‚Äôd like to remove myself as a potential nominee to be considered for the council</strong> as the new increased time commitments are past what I‚Äôm able to commit to (especially with the frequency of meetings and often time zones that are difficult for me) and I want to be supportive of those that are able to make this commitment.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/epowell101">@epowell101</a> - this is an interesting prompt. I am doing a lot of thinking about the pros &amp; cons of the delegate governance model and although it is different from metagovernance, there are parallels that can be drawn.  If anyone needs it, here is a primer on<a href="https://medium.com/@shawnlgrubb/the-value-of-metagovernance-and-why-should-i-care-f7cdc0a5fcc7" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"> metagovernance</a> which I am a wee bit partial to.</p>
<p>Although I believe there are <a href="https://indexcoop.com/blog/leveraging-metagovernance-for-change" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">fundamental gaps</a> in the way web3 approaches metagovernance, I can see how it does not have (or has less of) the agency problem delegation has.  For clarity - I am referring to token-owned metagovernance, not just delegated metagovernance - which to me is just delegation to an org vs. an individual.  Let‚Äôs connect on this, I have some ideas on how to leverage the public goods ecosystem for robust governance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how could we (steward council) care about other workstreams like (PGF, MC, MMM, GPC etc)?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is such a great point - and I see two perspectives - with infinite options in-between</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Decentralized maxi role: put this up for vote and let voters decide.  Downside of this is that you can inadvertently lop side the Council.  I have seen this happen in a DAO and the result was some months later the non-represented workstreams were voted out of existence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inclusive maxi role: Each workstream has an equal representation on the council.  Downside of this is less governance-engaged workstreams takes up space that could be utilized by more engaged strategic thinkers - the larger the council, the greater the issue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The middle path might be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Encourage more steward participation from under represented workstreams</li>
<li>Reserve limited percentage of seats for each workstream</li>
<li>Encourage the right mindset: council members must think ‚Äúwhat is best for the DAO‚Äù and not ‚Äúwhat is best for my workstream‚Äù</li>
</ol>
<p>The current version we are working includes a variation of <span class="hashtag-raw">#2</span>, and specific wording around <span class="hashtag-raw">#3</span>.  For number 1, I have reached out to an existing workstream that is underrepresented asked to join one of their calls (after GR15) to talk about the copious benefits of becoming a steward (fame, fortune, celebrity, etc. etc. etc.)<br>
does this approach resonate? Or are there other ideas we should consider?</p>

            <p>Hi Bob</p>
<p>Great question IMO!  This independence can be provided by metagovernance DAOs like Wildfire (full disclosure - I‚Äôm a member).</p>
<p>Overall however web3 does not have much of a model to fund such efforts.  Wildfire is a bit unique in that the founding team was able to summons hundreds of web3 enthusiasts to assist - and then did a screening to select and help to assign operators to various projects that the founders - <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/fire.png?v=12" title=":fire:" class="emoji" alt=":fire:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">_ <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/fire.png?v=12" title=":fire:" class="emoji" alt=":fire:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">  - wanted to support.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm one of a handful of people working in public goods.  There are also professionals working in DeFi, Creator Economy, and Infrastructure.  The collective perspective across DAOs is afaik pretty unique.</p>

    gm Gitcoin supporters, I‚Äôve been lurking a bit and contributing where I can in the general area of governance. 
I‚Äôd like to introduce Wildfire DAO - where I am lucky enough to be a core member of the public goods working group - an extension of Fire Eyes.  As many of you know, Fire Eyes was created by James Waugh, Coopahtroopa, 0xLucas, and gladstonecallum, all of whom are pretty well known by many here due to their role in crypto and specifically with Gitcoin and other DAOs.

</aside>
<p>As some people may know, I‚Äôm quite passionate about Gitcoin DAO and what it could grow into.<br>
IMHO(as a person that worked and joined over 10 daos, all with over 1 m$ in funding and with more than 100 members each) I can subjectivelly say that we are one of ‚Äúthe flagship DAOs‚Äù in the space.</p>
<p>We are not perfect and kinda face some of the issues that all DAOs face, BUT what could differentiate us(on a DAO level) could be the solutions that we implement to overcome those barriers. Constructive creativity bares a huge role here. I also think that conflict management should be included in the convo. I sometimes feel that people run away from conflict, but conflict should be discussed in a safe space because this is not a zero sum game, but a positive sum one=&gt; meaning that both parties could end up winning if the ‚Äúconflict‚Äù is managed properly.</p>
<p>What can I say‚Ä¶It‚Äôs just incredibly exciting to see what the SC will grow into <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/robot.png?v=12" title=":robot:" class="emoji" alt=":robot:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> and how it could forever shape the quadratic lands</p>

I sent a draft proposal over to <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/krrisis">@krrisis</a> on a proposal that addresses 1) what the council should, and should not do 2) council renumeration and 3) how we decide who is on the council - which is a copy past of your proposal above.</p>
<p>Beginning with the end in mind, I think we can set ourselves up with finding the right people, to do the right work.  Thanks again for the direction, and I am looking forward to iterating through this with you and incorporating broad feedback.</p>

Introducing v2 of the Steward Council & future plans

            <p>Hey all!</p>
<p>Thanks for putting this together, I think it‚Äôs a really great starting point. One thing I noticed that the current council only reflects a couple of workstreams (mainly FDD and DAO Ops) and misses quite a few highly active stewards. As <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle">@kyle</a> noted some folks are also no longer working for the DAO although they may have been when the snapshot was taken.</p>
<p>Especially given that we‚Äôre talking about this council being in place for a relatively long period (180 days) I‚Äôd like to propose an amended selection process, based on the success we‚Äôve seen in CSDO and other governance bodies. In fact, we could view ‚ÄúSC‚Äù as principally guiding strategic decisions while ‚ÄúCS‚Äù guides tactical ones. Take this as just one option as we continue to iterate towards the best possible stewards council.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Workstream Nomination.</strong> Each workstream nominates (via any process they see fit, one lead for each meeting (monthly). They are required to have prepared a list of key strategy questions (e.g. fraud might ask ‚Äòshould we have an open data service that helps us streamline Sybil data analysis‚Äô; PGF might ask ‚Äòwhat kinds of rounds should the program run that it isn‚Äôt thinking about and why‚Äô; GPC might ask ‚Äòhow do we ensure we‚Äôre building best with the community‚Äô). Workstreams risk slashing if they don‚Äôt come through with these questions consistently.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2a Steward Nomination,</strong> Each workstream nominates at most 3 stewards to go into a pool. Each steward must be a non-active workstream member (i.e. an ‚Äúindependent‚Äù member). This allows us to bring in folks that can provide strong external guidance and relevant domain expertise that might not be present internally. We can also require that selected stewards meet some threshold of activity or delegation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2b: Steward Nomination.</strong> Chosen stewards go into a QV, and workstreams nominate 3 members each to vote. We can even dogfood our own <a href="https://quadraticvote.co/">quadratic voting site</a> for this.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Ratification.</strong> We elect that council in a forum post + snapshot vote as usual. Crucially, if at any time someone needs to step down we can simply use the previous vote rankings to determine who might take their place.</p>
<p>IMO this wouldn‚Äôt take very long to organize and might yield better results than relying mainly on the health cards. For context, I originally designed the health cards as a way to track total steward engagement, but didn‚Äôt necessarily intend for it to be used in this kind of election process when I first conceived of it (though I think it‚Äôs a good input). Would love any thoughts and feedback on this approach.</p>

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/shawn16400">@shawn16400</a> <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle">@kyle</a> I was gonna ask about that actually. I have activity in governance and enough GTC delegated but I would still like to be given the choice to participate or not to the steward council.</p>
<p>At this point I would like to remain a steward but step down from the council as it‚Äôs demanding time-wise, compensation is not enough and perhaps replacing me with someone more aligned with the way gitcoin is ran right now would be better for the project.</p>

</aside>
<p>hi Kyle - for the new additions to the council - I have messages out for confirmation, and have already removed one candidate who said they no were longer interested.  One of the improvement areas we identified in the Retro was how Stewards move on, and <em>off</em> of the Council.  Given anyone can stop participation at any point, we would do well to build an offboarding process, triggers for that process, and what we should do if participation were to fall below a specific level.  To your question, I have not reached out to returning members asking for confirmation, but I can do that now.</p>

            <p>It may be also worth noting that a couple of the folks selected are no longer participating in or with the DAO (the joys of a lagging indication for selection process).</p>
<p>Have we confirmed that each of these people selected want to be included?</p>

<p>hi <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/lthrift">@lthrift</a> thanks for the question.  The selection of the Seward Council is an algorithm - a basic calculation of a persons average governance &amp; Gitcoin participation over the past 6 months.</p>
<p>the calculation is:<br>
V<em>0.7 + F_t</em>1.1 + F_t_p<em>1.5 + F_p</em>0.7 + F_p_p*1 + W</p>
<p>Where:<br>
<strong><code>V</code></strong> = Vote participation on Snapshot (only proposals with &gt;0.5M GTC are counted)<br>
<strong><code>F_t</code></strong> = Forum Topics initiated (excluding the ‚ÄúProposal Discussion‚Äù category)<br>
<strong><code>F_t_p</code></strong> = Forum Topics initiated in the ‚ÄúProposal Discussion‚Äù category<br>
<strong><code>F_p</code></strong> = Forum posts (excluding the ‚ÄúProposal Discussion‚Äù category)<br>
<strong><code>F_p_p</code></strong> = Forum posts in the ‚ÄúProposal Discussion‚Äù category<br>
<strong><code>W</code></strong> = Workstream involvement. Lead role adds 5p and contributor adds 3p to health.</p>

<h2>
<a name="tldr-2" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#tldr-2"></a>tl;dr</h2>
<p>This update seeks to inform the community about the results of a Steward Council v1 retroactive assessment, outline key priority areas for v2 of the Steward Council, and to announce the members of the Steward Council for the next 180 days.</p>
<p>For background, you can explore the initial proposal <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-the-steward-council/9485/11">introducing the Steward Council here</a>, as well as the <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-steward-council-formation-mandate/9843">The Steward Council - Formation &amp; Mandate </a> here.</p>
<p>This update is split into the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steward Council v1 Retroactive</li>
<li>Announcing members of the v2 Stewards Council</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="steward-council-v1-retroactive-results-3" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#steward-council-v1-retroactive-results-3"></a>Steward Council v1 Retroactive results</h2>
<p>The Steward Council was authorized via the <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0x5784ba66b16153b15cd2b94625909cb1b4ee7d1c6b5f033b30d037fa90140db9" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">The Steward Council Election &amp; Mandate</a> snapshot vote on March 11, 2022 for 180 days. As the period closes on September 7, 2022, and to prepare for the next session, a retro was conducted to capture lessons learned and identify areas of improvement.</p>
<p>The results are captured in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UnfCV3JVniGQlhy52QaEC6a8B1ZIx0cTCopRMGEq82g/edit?usp=sharing" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">slide deck</a>, but can be summarized in terms of what was done well, and what work still needs to be completed. Data was collected via one-on-one interviews, a qualitative survey, and a 1 hour review with the Stewards Council. The data collected, the input from the surveys, as well as a recording of the working group are all captured in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UnfCV3JVniGQlhy52QaEC6a8B1ZIx0cTCopRMGEq82g/edit?usp=sharing" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">slide deck</a>.</p>
<p>What worked well:</p>
<ul>
<li>We found a way to judiciously get the right people on the council</li>
<li>We built a respectful and professional group to debate difficult topics</li>
<li>We delivered a container and cadence for getting to a workable budget</li>
<li>The team standardized the budget building process making a big difference</li>
<li>We were able to identify the most important concerns</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the key outputs from the retro was to identify what work still needed to be done, and what (if any) adjustments still need to be made. Through the discussions and a quick voting mechanism - we identified the list below:</p>
<p>The work to be completed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue refining/simplifying the budgeting process</li>
<li>Clarify and optimize how members roll in and out of the Stewards council</li>
<li>Migrate topics to ‚Äúboard level‚Äù strategic discussions vs. tactical recommendations</li>
<li>Update and refine the mandate of the Steward council, incl remuneration of its members</li>
<li>Revise the steward health cards &amp; Steward Council selection algorithm</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, it should be noted that DAO Operation have identified the following related OKRs which will be delivered by the Governance team during Season 15:</p>
<ul>
<li>KR1: Create a clearly understood onboarding and incentivization process.</li>
<li>KR2: Launch a Governance Documentation Hub for new and existing stewards.</li>
<li>KR3: 80% of stewards and workstream leads view steward meeting structure, pacing and content favorably.</li>
<li>KR4: 80% of top stewards vote on 100% of formal S15 proposals.</li>
</ul>

<p>Recall this council looks to elevate the participation of the most engaged stewards as exemplified by the engagement scorecards and looking at stewards with a rating above 8/10. There have been no changes in the Steward Council selection methodology for now. For background, the current methodology is documented <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-steward-health-cards-2-0/10418">here</a> and revised <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-steward-council-formation-mandate/9843">here</a>.</p>
<p>In future, we do plan to continue improving the steward health cards including proposals related to the Steward Council selection process, but no changes were made in this selection.</p>
<p>The current lineup of Stewards with scores of 8/10 or over during the past 180 days is as follows:</p>

<p>This second Steward Council will be active until March 06, 2023 following the 180 day period as laid out in <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-steward-council-formation-mandate/9843">this original post</a>. This Council will take us through the end of Season 16, and comfortably into Season 17 before transition. If there are any adjustments to the current format or mandate, those changes will be brought to a community vote.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to express our appreciation and gratitude to all the Stewards for their contributions to our first Council - both those who will remain on the Council, and those who are departing. You developed a professional working group that has made a significant contribution to the success of Gitcoin, and we thank you.</p>
