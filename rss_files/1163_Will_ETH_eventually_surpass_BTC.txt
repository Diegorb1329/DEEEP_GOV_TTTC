            <p>I think BTC don‚Äôt have compets at all. Because it‚Äôs decentralised coin without beneficiary. That is what does BTC the main coin on the market.</p>

            <p>ETH has the potential to compete with BTC since its quickly growing and has many new projects associated with it. As soon as more places start to accept it like they accept BTC, I think there will be a big boom in ETH, definitely giving it a chance of being on the same level.</p>

            <p>Really? What are these use cases than aren‚Äôt existing in eth?<br>
I already assume that Ethereum is ‚Äúsurpassing‚Äù Bitcoin. As an analogy, I see Bitcoin like the discovery of electricity while Ethereum would be the equivalent of the national grid allowing all the devices we have in our homes today.</p>

            <p>Io penso che BTC sar√† sempre davanti a ETH.<br>
Non ci fa guadagnare la capitalizzazione ma il potenziale di un cripto.<br>
Significa che BTC sar√† sempre la pi√π scambiata e quindi rester√† la prima, anche come valore nominale, ma ETH in continua evoluzione ha un potenziale ancora superiore.</p>
