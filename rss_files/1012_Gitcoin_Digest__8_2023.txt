            <p>Totally agree with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/bobjiang">@bobjiang</a> - as part time contributor I am not able to join as many meetings, and discussions as I would like.  This summary helps maintain some level of context.  Thanks <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/gaoa97">@gaoa97</a> - I am sure this might get tedious or feel like a thankless task, but I for sure appreciate the effort and read every single one.  thank you.</p>
