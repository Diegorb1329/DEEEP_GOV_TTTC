2025 Delegate Nominations
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/2025-delegate-nominations/19903
    This nomination process is part of [Gitcoin's 2025 Governance Revamp](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-25-governance-revamp/19850), transitioning from our current steward model to a professional delegate system. We're seeking delegates who can help drive ecosystem growth while maintaining high standards of governance participation.

### TL;DR

There will be a total of 5 delegates selected for the 2025 council. *The proposal is currently still under a vote. If not passed, we will re-evaluate, but due to the time constraints with GG23 coming up, we would like to give the opportunity for nominations in the meantime.*

- Initial term: January - June 2025 (6 months)
- Performance review: End of Q2 2025
- Option to continue based on review and community feedback

## Compensation

- Quarterly compensation: $2,500 in GTC per delegate

- Voting power: ~1M GTC delegated from treasury across the 5 delegates

- Performance reviews: Quarterly self-reported engagement evaluations

### Delegate Responsibilities

Our delegates will carry three primary mandates:

**1. Core Governance**

* Active Participation: Must maintain 90% vote participation rate and provide written rationale for major decisions. Regular attendance at delegate coordination calls is required.
* Governance Innovation: Share insights and suggestions for governance improvements, with a goal of contributing meaningful enhancements to our processes and documentation each quarter.
* Budget Oversight: Review and approve community round budgets, providing detailed allocation rationales to ensure transparent fund management.
* Strategic Planning: Participate in quarterly governance reviews and help shape Gitcoin’s long-term vision through regular strategic input and ecosystem analysis.

**2. Lead the GG Community Rounds Decision-making**

* We have moved to a more decentralized future for Gitcoin Grants where we have begun to involve the community directly in vital decision-making when it comes to the community rounds that Gitcoin funds each quarter during GG rounds. The council’s responsibilities include:
  * Review and vote on GG community round proposals
  * Collaborate on GG community round retrospectives (optional)

The council will elect a ‘lead’ that will act as representative and report directly to the DAO with updates on a monthly basis.

**Time Commitment:**

- Core governance activities: at most 1-2 hours/week
- Community rounds review: 2 hours/week during GG rounds
- Partnership development: flexible, outcomes focused

Total: ~3 hours/week average

### Nomination Eligibility Criteria

* Must not be a current full-time contributor at Gitcoin and be able to commit 2+ hours per week to delegate responsibilities.
* Must have been active in the Web3 ecosystem with demonstrable experience in governance, grants, or community management.
* Must complete security training with Gitcoin's security consultant and maintain secure key management practices throughout the term.
* Must disclose any conflicts of interest during application and abstain from voting on any GG Community Rounds where conflicts exist.
* Must maintain 90% vote participation rate and provide written rationale for major decisions. Regular attendance at delegate coordination calls is required.

**Desired:**

- Professional DAO delegate experience in major DAOs
- Proven community leadership in values-aligned communities
- Established track record in public goods ecosystem

Avantgarde

            <p>Having personally worked closely with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/seedgov">@SEEDGov</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/pgov">@PGov</a> in other leading DAOs, we can vouch for them as excellent contributors. PGov brings lots of relevant experience from being on various committees/working groups, and SEEDGov is (imo) one of the most thorough and engaging delegates out there. We see a lot of value for Gitcoin in having a specialised governance organisation onboard in addition to dedicated individuals.</p>
<p>Best of luck to all nominees!</p>

<p>I’m deep in the governance game rn, focusing on market incentives and token value alignment across DAOs. Actively working closely with Griff (meeting almost daily) to optimize decision-making in major DAOs and he’ll be advising my votes.</p>
<p>I believe in making public goods funding more efficient and market-driven. We need GTC price to go up because that means more resources for funding what matters. My background in competitive gaming taught me that aligned incentives + clear metrics = better outcomes.</p>
<p>Additionally, I’m deeply interested in how AI governance agents can improve decision-making efficiency and reduce bias in grant distribution—an area I’d like to explore further within Gitcoin’s ecosystem.</p>

<p>To be quite honest I was hesitant on applying to be a delegate for a couple reasons I wasn’t sure abut my qualifications and wasn’t sure the direction Gitcoin is looking to head in 2025 aligned with my goals. After a couple conversation learning more about the direction with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/sov">@Sov</a>, being encouraged to apply by <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/sejalrekhan">@sejalrekhan</a> and having discussion within the Greenpill community I feel confident about my ability to be a valuable delegate for Gitcoin in 2025.</p>
<p>To speak to some of my qualifications I have actively been building in the regen space since 2021, 1st starting with WEFA. A project centered on connecting individuals and communities to nature in a fun way by creating a symbiotic relationship between plants and digital creatures. Working on this project helped me learn about the regen space as I started to look for one resources to build WEFA and two communities and people who would use it. This led me to communities like the Regen Network, Greenpill and Gitcoin and particularly with Greenpill I immediately felt a deep connection and alignment in values.</p>

<p>In 2023 I fully shifted my focus full time to Greenpill 1st starting as the Steward of the Los Angeles chapter, then initiating the Greenpill Dev Guild in October 2023 which become my core focus within the Network. Since then the Dev Guild has built a few projects, held workshops, community calls and operated numerous grant rounds establishing Guilds as 1st class citizen within the Network and making it an indispensable initiative for not only Greenpill but the regen space. During 2024 I became more active at Network level within Greenpill as a Network Steward. My 1st contribution was crafting the Greenpill Onboarding Guide which has become a single link we can share with any new member to help get them up to speed on all things Greenpill. Since then I’ve been active in leading network stewards calls, helping operate the regen coordination rounds, checking in on chapters, hosting monthly/weekly calls, creating pods for non chapter/guild members and much more.</p>

<p>To close this section I believe I’m a great candidate to be a delegate for Gitcoin due to my commitment shown to the regen movement within Greenpill where there was no financial incentive to build the Dev Guild and other aspects of the Network. My knowledge across the regen space at both a community and technical level provides me with insights on what individuals, communities and initiatives to help connect and coordinate. I have operated 5 grant rounds across Grant Ships and Gitcoin and with <a href="https://grantships.fun/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Grant Ships</a> being the tool for operating community round I can help facilitate it use. Lastly I have actively been involved with Allo Capital and can help to align it goals with Gitcoin ensuring the success and scale of both.</p>

<p>I have been involved in the Gitcoin Grants community 1st as a recipient of funding for the Greenpill Dev Guild and its projects,. Then as grant round operator, 1st for the Regen Coordination genesis round, then the Allo Builders Advancement round. Tangentially to the Gitcoin community I have operated two grant rounds using the Allo based tool Grant Ships, being apart of their initial alpha and beta rounds.</p>

<p>I recently became a Celo delegate and participated in the voting for the Celo Citizens Round where I evaluated 183 Celo contributors. I also am a delegate in Optimism and Arbitrum and have participated in voting and community discussions. Within Greenpill I have been active in the informal governance of the Network making key decision to help continue it’s growth.</p>

<p>Given how involved the Greenpill community is within the Gitcoin ecosystem there will potentially be conflicts of interest in regards to grant rounds, specifically community ones. Also I am involved in Allo Capital which scope is not fully defined yet but ideally will be a core initiative I’m apart of in 2025. Lastly as a Celo delegate there may be some initiatives with Celo and Gitcoin for funding/grant rounds. If conflicts arise I will abstain from participating in a vote or decision making process.</p>

<p><strong>Applicant Summary including why you are interested in applying to become a 2025 delegate:</strong></p>
<p>I am a coral reef researcher, scientific diver, and ocean conservation advocate specializing in coral reef restoration, biodiversity, and herbivory studies in the Mexican Caribbean. I hold a BSc in Marine Biology (UADY) and an MSc in Coral Reef Ecology (CINVESTAV-IPN) and actively engage in environmental education, citizen science, and scientific research in traditional and decentralized programs in coral reef conservation, <a href="https://x.com/MesoReefDAO" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">MesoReefDAO</a>: and socio-ecological systems with <a href="https://hub.greenpill.network/t/greenpill-mexico/23" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GreenPill México</a>. Since 2020, I have been involved in the DeSci movement, advocating for blockchain-based solutions in the conservation of connectivity between land and ocean. Since 2024, I have been focusing part-time on partnerships and business development with <a href="https://link3.to/aurasci" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">AuraSci</a>.</p>
<p>As a marine biologist and decentralized science (DeSci) advocate, I aim to bridge ecological conservation with Web3 governance to advance Gitcoin’s mission of funding public goods. My dual expertise in coral reef ecosystems and blockchain-based solutions uniquely positions me to contribute to Gitcoin’s governance revamp, particularly in evaluating environmental public goods and fostering cross-sector partnerships with institutions such as research centers, NGOs, and others. This will focus on three main areas: (1) Governance Alignment, (2) Public Goods Expertise, and (3) Non-Web3 Partnerships Experience.</p>
<p><strong>Involvement in Gitcoin Grants community or prior initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>I have been involved in Gitcoin since gg18 as a grantee with <a href="https://x.com/MesoReefDAO" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">MesoReefDAO</a>. Since 2023, I have promoted the Green Pill network in <a href="https://x.com/GreenPillMexico" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">México</a>, conducting some experiments in communities. I have also been quite supportive of the <a href="https://x.com/climate_program" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Climate Coordination network</a>, which leverages Web3 components to mitigate climate change in communities.</p>
<p>I have been selected as Gitcoin <a href="https://checker.gitcoin.co/public/project/show/rodrigo-nunksz-desci-regen-web3-tools-and-public-goods-and-services" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Citizens Retro Round #3</a>, with some actions in translating Gitcoin content and volunteering in physical events.</p>

<p><strong>Applicant Summary including why interested in applying to become a 2025 delegate</strong></p>
<p>Thank you Gitcoin for the opportunity to apply to become a delegate as part of the Gitcoin’s 2025 Governance Revamp!</p>
<p>As a skilled full-stack engineer and data analyst, I am deeply aligned with Gitcoin’s vision.</p>
<p>After contributing to the success of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=10154496381589774" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">iBeer</a> app, I took a leap into the Web3 space in 2017, stepping out of my comfort zone.<br>
Throughout the years, I have cultivated a robust network within the developer ecosystem and have earned recognition through numerous prizes at Gitcoin, Encode Club, Buidlbox, and ETHGlobal hackathons.</p>
<p>I’ve been actively engaged with Gitcoin since my first faucet request in <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1b543daf4fefcee5a16dd7a692f8e4ce112dba215aa3dee8a770ed11fba3f8bd" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">April 2018</a>, hacking, experimenting, and learning. My contributions extend to several Gitcoin workstreams, including Moonshot Collective (as a frontend), MMM &amp; DAO Ops (as a data analyst).</p>
<p>In particular, my work with MMM was focused on Governance and Delegation, which sparked my interest in becoming a delegate. For more insights, feel free to watch my keynote on Governance in Data at <a href="https://youtu.be/FztfXH3meC8?si=NYyjluCZJ5rrPXih" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Dunecon</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve also been part of the Builderband - Gitcoin’s High Performance Alumni Network - and the Kernel Genesis Block.</p>

<p>Tané is formed with a group of crypto-native product builders, based in Tokyo, Dubai and New York.</p>
<p>Our investment arm has invested in and supported various innovating projects that contribute to the decentralized society enabled by the new blockchain technology. Our network operation entity has been contributing to the ecosystem by being node operators for the core infrastructures and protocols as well as participating in DAO governance of several projects as detailed below.</p>
<p>While working closely and discussing opportunities with some of the Gitcoin core members and public goods round participants, we are deeply impressed and aligned with Gitcoin’s mission to support public goods and promote decentralized governance, and we are excited about the opportunity to contribute to this effort. As a team with experience in multiple DAO governance activities as well as hands-on involvement in node operations, we believe we can bring unique insights to Gitcoin’s delegate council.</p>
<p>Additionally, as a Japan-rooted team, we can offer a valuable perspective from Japan and Asia, where the web3 ecosystem is rapidly growing. We see this as an opportunity to bring insights from Asia and drive meaningful contributions to Gitcoin’s governance.</p>

<strong>Linkedin:</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomislavmamic" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Tomislav Mamić</a></p>
<p><strong>Applicant Summary:</strong><br>
I joined Ethereum communty in 2017 by organising local meetups. Meetups evolved into a <a href="https://blocksplit.net" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">BlockSplit</a> conference - OG blockchain event that ran until last year. In my work on BlockSplit, I was particularly focused on making sure we are at the edge of knowledge and technology and exploring  narratives, usecases and market opportunities.</p>
<p>One of such opportunities was partnering with cities to help them use Ethereum to improve their public goods funding. This led me to <a href="https://muqa.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Muqa</a> - municipal quadratic funding initiative. We relied on Allo protocol, and built a <a href="https://zazelenimo.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">custom frontend</a> that makes it easy for citizens to get an Ethereum account, purchase tokens and donate to city’s projects.</p>
<p>I recognise this as a great opportunity for Ethereum to onboard regular citizens, neighbours and institutions like cities. Also, working with governments is a natural next step for Gitcoin in its quest to grow the GMV and serve more users.</p>
<p>I believe I have the knowledge and understanding which will be the key for getting Gitcoin ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>experience building on the existing Gitcoin’s stack</li>
<li>knowledge of the public goods funding market landscape</li>
<li>raising matching pools</li>
<li>selling Gitcoin</li>
<li>owning relationships with institutions like cities and UNDP</li>
<li>running (as an operator and a steward) a Gitcoin Community round (Desci Community Round)</li>
<li>have led multiple organisations from non-profitability to profitability</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why I want to become a Gitcoin delegate:</strong><br>
This would be my first professional delegate role. The main reason why I haven’t taken any prior delegate roles is that I’ve never been that interested in participating in management of any DAO. I was more occupied by running my own projects or experimenting. However this led me to Gitcoin. I see Gitcoin’s role as a key piece of the puzzle in Ethereum’s breakout to the masses. Gitcoin has the track record, technology, community mindshare and strong DAO which all position it well for being the partner of choice for those that allocate billions of dollars for public goods projects in the real world. I can see this clearly. However, having worked with Gitcoin’s tech stack and product line, I see a lot of bloat and mismatch between Gitcoin’s offering and what is actually needed. I want to make sure Gitcoin doesn’t fumble this opportunity. Instead of chasing latest web3 narratives, I believe Gitcoin should chart its own path toward users and growth, and I believe I can help.</p>
<p>Also, I want to emphasise that I don’t want to be involved in day to day management of Gitcoin. I’d like to continue running experiments with Muqa (relying or not on Gitcoin’s technology), but make sure that if we do hit a gold vein, there is a clear downstream path for the unlocked market opportunity to Ethereum through Gitcoin.</p>
<p><strong>Involvement in Gitcoin Grants community or prior initiatives:</strong><br>
<a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-decentralized-science-reflection-report/19025">I was an operator and a steward</a> of the <a href="https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/39" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GG20 Decentralized Science Round</a>. Prior that my project was a grantee in previous Desci round. My involvement in Gitcoin community has grown since, and I have been regularly participating in this forum, particularly in discussions about the future of Gitcoin, which is visible from my profile stats.</p>
<p><strong>Prior experience in either Grants or Delegate Programs, respectively:</strong><br>
I have been participating as a grantee in dozens of different grant programs in web3 and outside of it over the years. Most relevant experience was the involvement of organising Decentralized Science Round and the experience of organising an upcoming participatory budgeting round in partnership with city of Split.</p>
<p><strong>Any anticipated conflicts of interest:</strong><br>
I manage Muqa, which is a user of Allo protocol (and hopefully GG23). As long as we are able and it makes sense, we will continue evolving our custom frontend to make it better fit for our user’s needs, and continue using Gitcoin’s products and services. Everything we build and create is and will remain open source and Gitcoin will be free to use it as anyone else.<br>
I see that we are doing experiments which are not on Gitcoin’s roadmap in the short run, but might be in the long run. Anyways, our work is directly beneficial to Gitcoin, even if it ends up being just another dead end, at least we’ll know what doesn’t work. However, we are not married to using just Gitcoin, as we already work on new experiments where it might not make sense to use Gitcoin.<br>
If any COI arises over time, I believe it’s best to address it in time, either by publicly expressing it, refraining from participating in certain decisions, or stepping down from the delegate position.</p>

<p><strong>Applicant Summary including why interested in applying to become a 2025 delegate</strong>:</p>
<p>I’m a Founder from the Dominican Republic who is passionate about building solutions for our most pressing needs. I’m the Secretary of <a href="https://kokonut.network/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Kokonut Network</a>, a blockchain-based cooperative powered by Trees and People.</p>
<p>Besides the work I do at Kokonut, I’ve been involved in the Web3 Community since 2021, and I’ve been part of many Founders Circles and Working Groups, one of the most notable being the <a href="https://ebfcommons.org/meet-the-team/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">EBF Framework</a>, Gitcoin Community Council, and the <a href="https://www.basin.global/rwa-refi-report" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">RWA x ReFi Report</a>.</p>
<p>As a Public Good, I help coordinate, run, and architect the operations of <a href="https://www.letsgrow.network/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Let’s GROW Live</a>; this is a 24/7 event hosted for the Gitcoin Community with more than 600 speaking slots, 60+ Grantees, 2,000+ speakers, and thousands of organic interactions during 2 weeks.</p>
<h4><a name="why-would-i-be-a-good-fit-1" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#why-would-i-be-a-good-fit-1"></a>Why would I be a good fit?</h4>
<p>I’m a Public Goods Maxi and Regen at heart, working to build, scale, and globally expand Kokonut Network as a response to solving a systematic problem that affects millions of people globally; <strong>the lack of funding for IRL projects within underserved communities</strong>, as these communities doesn’t meet the standard criteria of Legacy Organizations.</p>
<p>I think my work is critical to help move the needle by challenging the status quo, so for me, this is not about building another company or business. It is about <a href="https://x.com/KokonutNetwork/status/1843262509492404627" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">sending a message of change</a> from each of the entities within the Kokonut Ecosystem.</p>
<p>I could bring a different perspective to the Governance of Gitcoin DAO as I’m not a delegate in any other major DAOs but have been building my network from the ground up without any connections or “hand-outs” by actively participating in value aligned communities thru my time in web3, Gitcoin has the brand recognition within Web3 Public Goods Realm because of its contributions to novel ideas and experiments which some of them has helped shape projects at the Infra &amp; App Layer; as a delegate I would make sure that the community &amp; builder centric approach stay a thing while Gitcoin still pursue its north stars.</p>
<p><strong>I have context and already read almost every governance post after I joined the forum:</strong><br>

Puncar</p>

<p><strong>Applicant Summary including why interested in applying to become a 2025 delegate:</strong><br>
I joined Gitcoin three years ago after working on other open-source software projects because I truly believe that open-source software runs the world. Ensuring these projects receive sufficient funding is crucial for continued innovation and sustainability. Over the years, I’ve seen how Gitcoin Grants has helped fund critical public goods, and I believe it’s important to take an active role in steering the program to ensure resources are allocated effectively. Becoming a delegate allows me to contribute to the long-term sustainability of open-source ecosystems and ensure funding is distributed in a way that maximizes impact.</p>
<p><strong>Involvement in Gitcoin Grants community or prior initiatives:</strong><br>
I have been a core team member of Gitcoin for 1.5 years and co-wrote <em><a href="https://www.howtodao.xyz/">How to DAO</a></em> with Gitcoin founder Kevin Owocki. Additionally, I have been both a grant applicant for small projects and a funder of various initiatives, giving me a comprehensive understanding of the grants process from multiple perspectives. My direct involvement in Gitcoin Grants over the years has provided me with deep insights into its impact, challenges, and opportunities for improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Prior experience in either Grants or Delegate Programs, respectively:</strong><br>
I have extensive experience in governance and grants allocation. As a recognized delegate at MakerDAO, I contributed to governance discussions and funding decisions. I also worked on meta-governance initiatives at Index Coop, strengthening DAO-to-DAO collaboration. In addition, I have worked with Arbitrum and Polygon as a grant reviewer, ensuring funding decisions align with ecosystem growth. To stay informed about different funding mechanisms, I have closely followed Optimism’s Retroactive Public Goods Funding and other grant models. I also organized the <em>Grants Funding Forum</em>, a two-day conference during ETHCC Brussels that brought together grant initiators, administrators, and ecosystem leaders to discuss the future of capital allocation.</p>

I am actively involved in multiple projects, but none of them are seeking Gitcoin funding, nor do they have any medium-term plans to participate in Gitcoin grant rounds. My role as a delegate is focused on providing a broad and unbiased perspective on the ecosystem to ensure fair and impactful grant distribution.</p>

            <p>Thank you for those who have nominated themselves! Love seeing such strong candidates already coming through.</p>
<p>One update I would like to highlight is that after some reflection and feedback, we have lightened the scope of work for the delegates, removing the “ecosystem growth” piece, ensuring that the expectations outlined for the delegates and compensation may balance out more.</p>

<p><strong>Applicant Summary including why interested in applying to become a 2025 delegate</strong>:</p>
<p>Hello everyone! We are a team of dedicated governance enthusiasts who have been in the governance space for over four years. Our team was some of the first members involved in defi governance and we want to apply what we have learned over the years to Gitcoin. Having worked and chatted with many members of the core teams for months now, we would love to get more involved with Gitcoin. As a delegate, our goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Growth: Our decisions are primarily focused on the growth of the protocol. This often results in how to spend money efficiently, but even more importantly and objecting for unreasonable spends and knowing when to vote no.</li>
<li>Transparency: Clear communication with votes and explanations of reasoning, and an equivalent demand for proposals to do the same. Too often we see thousands, if not millions, being rolled up together and glossed over during proposals.</li>
<li>Accountability: Too often once a decision is done, having proper accountability becomes an afterthought. Whether it’s a DAO promise or a grant or a new program, once a DAO votes something in, we forget about it. Our goal with PGov is to both continue to check in on these decisions as well as ensure that there are proper channels set up to ensure accountability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Involvement in Gitcoin Grants community or prior initiatives</strong>: We partook in GG20 grants as part of the governance ecosystem delegates initiative and have been an active Gitcoin delegate since the end of last year! Additionally, we have been active in the governance space for over four years and have been involved across many well known DAOs.</p>
<p><strong>Prior experience in either Grants or Delegate Programs</strong>: Some relevant grants and delegate programs that we’ve helped out on include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimism: S5/S6 Grants Council, S7 Milestones and Metrics Council</li>
<li>Compound: Compound Grants Program, Governance Working Group</li>
<li>Uniswap: Accountability Program, Metagov Team</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Any anticipated conflicts of interest</strong>: If situations arise, we will abstain from a vote, and clearly state the conflict on the forums.</p>

            <p>gm gm, friends and allies.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for the opportunity to apply to be an official delegate of Gitcoin DAO. This community has a special place in my heart and my life’s work, and I would be honored to represent the community’s voice in decision-making processes. Below is my formal application.</p>

<li>Applicant Summary including why interested in applying to become a 2025 delegate:</li>
</ul>
<p>My first exposure to the notion of public goods occurred in 2020 when I first interacted with Gitcoin while doing research into DAOs and web3 coordination. Ever since, my entire theory of change for societal transformation has been rooted in an understanding that funding public goods is one of the most powerful strategies we can employ to create impact at scale. I believe in Gitcoin’s mission and I see this community as one of the foremost examples of the prosocial potential for web3 in the broader efforts to address climate change, support resilient local communities, and regenerate our planet.</p>
<p>My interest in supporting Gitcoin as a delegate is rooted in my sense of our shared potential to build upon Gitcoin’s early successes which have already established mindshare in the broader web3 narrative landscape and directed significant resources to open source software development and social impact causes. I sense that the next wave of Gitcoin’s success depends on our collective ability to expand into new mechanisms and new areas of impact. Onchain impact verification is one of the most promising use cases for web3 generally and I am devoted to on-boarding off-chain social impact communities to begin the process of allocating resources and reporting impact onchain.</p>
<p>Building bridges between communities has been a longstanding passion and skill I’ve cultivated as a weaver across web3, regenerative, bioregional, coordination tech, mutual aid, civic engagement, and community organizing cultural groups and organizations. As an advocate for Gitcoin’s next era, I bring a depth of relationships with aligned networks who could benefit from participatory resource allocation infrastructure and could also inform the design of new mechanisms to meet their needs. I believe I hold a clear vision for the future of public goods funding and the various social impact use cases that could expand the narrative of onchain resource allocation as a backbone in the future of philanthropy.</p>
<p>One of my key strategic goals as a delegate would be to advocate for and engage with these potential new partners where they are, helping to develop storytelling that expands Gitcoin’s position in these spaces by making visible the power and potential of participatory budgeting and onchain impact reporting. Having already accomplished a small win towards this broader goal within the context of the BioFi Pathfinders Round, I feel confident in my ability to bring traditional funders and grassroots impact organizations alike into the Gitcoin ecosystem.</p>
<p>As someone who has spent the last two years building a DAO for public goods builders, I know the challenges and potential of distributed governance firsthand. As we engage in our own “progressive protocolization roadmap,” I’m excited to contribute what we’re learning to the Gitcoin governance methodologies while simultaneously bringing what I’m learning from Gitcoin’s DAO governance into OpenCivics. One of our key outcomes this year will be the decentralization of our Community Round proposal process, utilizing onchain mechanisms to empower the community to govern the themes and criteria for our grant rounds. While our participation as Community Round operators presents potential conflicts of interest (and thus abstention from voting), we’re committed to decentralizing our own internal processes and will be sharing our methodology with the Gitcoin community as an “open protocol” or playbook for other Community Round Operators. I believe that with the appropriate transparency and abstention from some Community Round deliberations, this potential conflict of interest could actually be transformed into a value add for the community by ensuring that Gitcoin’s internal processes reflect the needs and perspectives of Round Operators.</p>
<p>Gitcoin’s developer community has been incredibly generous to us as Community Round Operators, responding actively to feature requests and bug reports. I hope to extend this advocacy in the role of delegate by leveraging my experiences as a Round Operator to ensure Gitcoin’s processes are supportive to the flourishing of the Community Round Operator ecosystem. To date, I have operated four community rounds and have learned through experience what it takes to run a successful community-driven grants program. I hope to bring that experience and expertise in service of all Community Round Operators as the program evolves. Utilizing the Gitcoin brand to help activate new capital flows into matching funds for Community Rounds is another high level strategic goal I would hope to achieve as a delegate.</p>
<p>Overall, I’m a ride-or-die Gitcoin community member who would be playing these roles naturally without any formal engagement. If elected, I would bring my own deep well of motivation, passion, and care for this community into a more operational and decision-making role that I feel would be even more impactful than if I engaged in that advocacy and strategic support on my own.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration.<br>
Fund What Matters <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/handshake.png?v=12" title=":handshake:" class="emoji" alt=":handshake:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> In Us We Trust</p>
<ul>
<li>Involvement in Gitcoin Grants community or prior initiatives:</li>
</ul>
<p>I began my participation in the Gitcoin Grants Community through an early Community Round funded personally by Owocki himself, focused on projects addressing the ‘meta-crisis.’ Since then, OpenCivics has participated in three rounds as a grantee and I have personally operated three rounds for OpenCivics and one round for the BioFi Project’s first foray into web3 grants.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prior experience in either Grants or Delegate Programs, respectively:</li>
</ul>
<p>Through the context of OpenCivics, I have both designed grant round criteria and impact reporting schemas for our civic-focused grant rounds. We have also been designing our own Delegate program to help streamline our hybrid governance transition into further onchain decision-making which will be formally launched in the OpenCivics Consortium DAO structure later this year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Any anticipated conflicts of interest:</li>
</ul>
<p>OpenCivics plans to continue our onchain grants program through Community Rounds and other mechanisms for the foreseeable future. To mitigate this conflict of interest, I would personally abstain from any decisions regarding OpenCivics. Additionally, I co-founded a community co-working space in Boulder, CO with Gitcoin founder, Owocki. To mitigate this conflict of interest, I would actively create a barrier in our friendship regarding any DAO decisions to avoid his undue influence on DAO matters.</p>
