Thank you to all contributing to GR14! This was a spectacular round that made Gitcoin History!

:email: If you would like to receive this newsletter in your inbox, [sign up here!](https://form.typeform.com/to/ttNCMt8w)

**üëâ Key actions for this week:**

1. Earn a POAP for helping FDD to [test new software](https://gitcoin-grant-disputes.ethelo.net/page/welcome-to-the-gia) for reviewing grant applications.
2. Stroll down memory lane with [GitcoinDAO's First Year-in-Review](https://gitcoindao.com/yearinreview/yir.pdf) and also see what big things we have on the horizon.

## üî• Hot Topics:

* [Jodi](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/jodi_gitcoindao/summary) shares nuanced updates to [GitcoinDAOs Adopted Purpose and Essential Intents](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/update-gitcoindaos-adopted-purpose-and-essential-intents/10984) like removing ‚Äòbuild‚Äô from the purpose to simplify it to: ‚ÄùTo empower communities to fund their shared needs.‚Äù She also announces that the CSDO ratified these statements: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really important to state here that this is a beginning, not an end. As GitcoinDAO grows, the essential work will change with it. With that said, we hope the statements provide all contributors a clear sense of the direction we‚Äôre all building toward.‚Äù

* In [Passport is our AWS](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/passport-is-our-aws/10995), [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary) compares AWS, a trojan horse hiding within the Amazon store to Gitcoin Grants hiding Gitcoin Passport. With this post, Owocki emphasizes how large the opportunity will be for a Sybil resistance or DeSoc identity primitive that drives a shift from 1-token-1-vote to 1-human-1-vote. He also shares that Greenpill podcast season 2 will likely focus on Sybil resistance and asks who he should have on.

* [The Network Effects of GitcoinDAOs protocols](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-network-effects-of-gitcoindaos-protocols/10973/2) by [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary) points out that network effects scale exponentially to increase growth and this applies directly to Gitcoin grants‚Äô funders and projects. He proposes that Gitcoin consider bootstrapping some of the early, cold start days of Gitcoin Passport to make sure the user base scales to a critical mass to keep growing on its own.

* [ Remove Lifetime funding received from Gitcoin Grant page](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-remove-lifetime-funding-received-from-gitcoin-grant-page/10981) from [Lefteris](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/lefterisjp/summary) claims the lifetime funding number for a grant creates a tax liability, is ‚Äúwrong and by a big margin‚Äù, and excludes grants from ecosystem rounds because the token prices have fell since the time of donation. [Connor](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/connor/summary) asks if Lefteris has any data he can share, verify that ‚Äúthe price tokens were received at is what matters most‚Äù for tax purposes, and shares that ecosystem rounds (like ENS) set their own rules.

* In [Gitcoin Accelerator Program -> GTC utility](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-accelerator-program-gtc-utility/10967), [Puncar](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/puncar-dev/summary) outlines his belief that ‚Äúevery organization needs to have a long-term sustainable economic model that creates more value than it consumes.‚Äù He proposes a Gitcoin Accelerator Program whereby the early-stage projects on Gitcoin Grants would be provided support that could turn into DAO revenue later on. [Saf](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/safder/summary) responds to share from his experience running an accelerator at Protein: ‚ÄúI support this idea in theory if we were still in an abundance mindset (and would love to revisit when we go back there), I think it‚Äôs too big of an undertaking for the current climate.‚Äù

## [üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Workstream Discussion](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/workstream-discussion/9)

### üå± [Public Goods Funding](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Public-Goods-4ccd579f433c4dff9d8952314468d6e8)

* We‚Äôre so happy with the turnout for GR14! Our contributors really showed up. With over 44k unique grant funders contributing over $1.7 million, we had the highest numbers we‚Äôve ever had!

* We‚Äôre locking in commitments for GR15 and mutual grants partnerships. Our contributors will be discussing a Public Goods coalition and making connections during NFT.NYC.

### [üöÄ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-prototyping-workstream-moonshot-budget-request-q4-2021/8785) [Moonshot Collective](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Moonshot-Collective-ffa78f44a0de412cb607f9b69d3a376f)

* **Gitcoin Passport**: We‚Äôve been squashing bugs and upgrading nodes

* **Governance Operations Scaling**: Our team has been researching, meeting, discussing, and has landed on focusing on three key items:
  * Process for non-binary funding of workstream season budgets
  * Improvement of deep discussions and coordination for budget proposals
  * Improvement of context sharing.

* **Operations:** The collective completed an expedited peer-review process and shipped an updated notion page, including a refined mission statement: ‚ÄúMoonshot Collective is an open and diverse network of builders, hackers, and regens. We focus on experimentation and innovation that advances the purpose and essential intent of GitcoinDAO.‚Äù

### üíô [Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Fraud-Detection-Defense-2bde13c0b8e74fda81435d94e49e2703)

* **Community Intelligence:** We conducted an analysis to determine if our trust bonus weightings are optimal. The analysis required running 3.7 billion calculations and over three days of computing time. We were able to show our weightings were not optimal and determine a better method to optimize.

* **Grants Intelligence Agency:** All open [disputes](https://gitcoin.notion.site/e79f1dd9e5074a1d986ee3f91b12943e?v=74372375b4ba42ebb269be219f2c452d) and [appeals](https://gitcoin.notion.site/5627564cce204a0f8ae5af463873bb3d?v=2510b1a2634b4a0ea24cf2b81241d13a) will be closed before Tuesday, June 28th. We are using [an Ethelo instance](https://gitcoin-grant-disputes.ethelo.net/page/welcome-to-the-gia) to help us decentralize decision-making and amplify community voices.

* **Data Operations:** We‚Äôve been focused on the Sybill Account Detection (SAD) model to run daily predictions in close collaboration with human evaluation. We analyze the results of training and running the model to resolve bugs and extract usable data.

* **Operating System:** We passed a proposal to make our S15 process clear by aggregating resources into a single document. We‚Äôre engaged in a greater DAO discussion regarding contributor compensation.

### üé® [Merch, Memes & Marketing](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Merch-Memes-and-Marketing-60cc693f0fe14be1879a05587922c8a3)

* Our brand marketing and content strategy teams have been hard at work on building a handbook to guide the future direction of our brand content. We‚Äôre pleased to share today that the [MMM Content Handbook](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO0BktOo=/?share_link_id=473865239855) has a v1 complete to guide streamlined & decentralized content creation.

* Did you know it‚Äôs already been a year since the launch of GitcoinDAO and GTC? We‚Äôve taken some time to reflect on the past year and what we hope the coming one will bring. Check out our very first [GitcoinDAO Year in Review](http://gitcoindao.com/yearinreview), [hot off the presses](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoindao-year-in-review/11003)!

* Operationally, we completed a first draft of a new MMM compensation model and kicked off the sprint of ‚Äúv3‚Äù of our [Steward Health Cards](https://www.daostewards.xyz/).

* In order to make sure GR14 ends strong, we held Fundapalooza on Thursday at 7pm UTC and were joined by over 500 live internet regens! We‚Äôre tallying up the final count on the round but it looks to be our most successful round EVER! üéâ

### ‚òÄÔ∏è [DAO Operations](https://gitcoin.notion.site/DAO-Ops-84f425e281ae49579a2b4acf0bad5dd5)

* CSDO: This week, we discussed how the budget process for S14 went and agreed we want to identify a better process for S15. We passed a proposal to delay S15 budgets by 1 month and are discussing 6-month budgets with a 3-month check in. We also talked about organizing around protocols, sybil defense, socializing interworkstream initiatives, and a budget proposal for the Gitcoin Product Collective as it spins out of holdings.

* We‚Äôre discussing season 15 timeline with our stewards and an updated budget proposal flow.

* We‚Äôve developed a DAO-wide spending report and planning to publish it with a regular cadence. Stay tuned for more!

### üõ† [Grants 2.0](https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/Grants-2-0-f2860138cbb24505b5cb2d8576119a78)

* **Gitcoin Passport:** In collaboration with the Moonshot Collective, we are stabilizing our ceramic node infrastructure to support the heavy user inflow we saw during GR14



* **Grants Hub**: We‚Äôre excited to announce we are [100% dev-complete](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LyAuPQgzwkx_MRsV3_5DIdzjYkZ00z9Q/view?usp=sharing) with our MVP! In the next couple of weeks, we‚Äôll be getting production-ready to meet our July 1st deadline.

* **Round Manager/Explorer:** Check out our [first demo](https://share.vidyard.com/watch/ceKWmWCmMERDewqWn2sq1Q?)! While building this steelthread, the team has also been hard at work defining milestones and subtasks for building out our first MVP by July 5th.

<p>CSDO: This week, we discussed how the budget process for S14 went and agreed we want to identify a better process for S15. We passed a proposal to delay S15 budgets by 1 month and are discussing 6-month budgets with a 3-month check in. We also talked about organizing around protocols, sybil defense, socializing interworkstream initiatives, and a budget proposal for the Gitcoin Product Collective as it spins out of holdings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We‚Äôre discussing season 15 timeline with our stewards and an updated budget proposal flow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We‚Äôve developed a DAO-wide spending report and planning to publish it with a regular cadence. Stay tuned for more!</p>
