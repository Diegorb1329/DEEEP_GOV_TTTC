Routing your request to work with GitcoinDAO üîÄ
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/routing-your-request-to-work-with-gitcoindao/11290
    From time to time, people slide into my DMs asking if they can do some work with GitcoinDAO.

These requests vary in nature, sometimes people want to sponsor a matching round.  Sometimes people want Gitcoin to join a twitter spaces.  Sometimes they are partnership requests.  

But in almost all cases, I cannot field the requests because I've [disaffiliated from DAO leadership](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/passing-the-torch/10971/2).

So I am creating this gov post to help route these requests.  My goal for this post is to (1) get these requests out of my DMs + get them to where DAO members can see them (2) route them to who can actually help.

Here is an easy 3 step process to route your request: 

# 1. Verify that this request matches the essential intents of Gitcion

Everything at Gitcoin revolves around this purpose (100 year vision) and essential intents (12-18 months vision).

From [this post](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/update-gitcoindaos-adopted-purpose-and-essential-intents/10984):
[quote="Jodi_GitcoinDAO, post:1, topic:10984"]
**The Purpose of Gitcoin**
*To empower communities to fund their shared needs.*

**The Essential Intents of Gitcoin**

1. Protocol Adoption
   * *Build a widely adopted, modular Grants protocol that creates a flourishing ecosystem of funding mechanisms.*
   * *Build a widely adopted, modular Pluralism Passport protocol that creates a flourishing ecosystem of network effects around Decentralized Society.*
2. Financial Sustainability
   * *Have a comprehensive, diversified strategy for financial stability of the DAO in order to effectively achieve our mission.*
3. DAO Organization
   * *Create and promote clear and engaging rituals, communication channels, and messaging that build emergent shared context among GitcoinDAO‚Äôs contributors, stewards, and supporters.*
4. Grants Program Success
   * *Enable a successful grants protocol launch by dogfooding it internally and supporting ecosystems in adopting it.*
   * *Continue to support the Ethereum ecosystem and public goods in web3 and beyond through Gitcoin-led rounds.*

If your inquiry does not match this purpose/essential intent it is not likely to be actioned.
