# TL;DR

In October, the Climate Round “graduated” from the Gitcoin Grants Program and has since been managed by CCN. CCN is a global group composed of the Gitcoin Climate advisory and coordination team. In October, before GG19, the CCN team took over full ownership of running the Climate Solutions round as a Community Round. This proposal outlines our plans for the future and requests funding from Gitcoin to support the long-term growth of CCN and the Climate Solutions Round.

## Background

Since GR12, the Climate Solutions Round has enormously impacted the web3 Climate/ReFi space. We have crowdfunded nearly $1M and distributed almost $3.9M in funding to hundreds of projects in the midst of bear market conditions.

Driven by the belief that climate action is the ultimate public good because climate change increasingly affects all of humanity, as well as a mission to accelerate climate action, the Climate Coordination Network is excited for the opportunity to take the Climate Solutions Program to the next level of effective and focused global impact. Shown below is a map of the GG19 Climate Solutions round impact worldwide:

Driven by the belief that climate action is the ultimate public good because climate change increasingly affects all of humanity, as well as a mission to accelerate climate action, the Climate Coordination Network is excited for the opportunity to take the Climate Solutions Program to the next level of effective and focused global impact.

## A few of Many Success Stories

**Shamba Network**

Situated in Nairobi, Kenya, Shamba Network utilizes blockchain technology, remote sensing, and statistical sampling to tackle financial inclusion and climate change challenges in sub-Saharan Africa. With a primary focus on assisting smallholder farmers, Shamba advocates for sustainable agriculture and employs blockchain for access to emerging financial landscapes, such as climate insurance and carbon markets.

Through the implementation of ecological data oracles and smart contracts, Shamba streamlines processes related to climate insurance, leading to large cost reductions. The initiative collaborates with various Web 3 climate solutions to establish a more extensive ecosystem and is actively striving to empower smallholder farming communities to issue their own carbon credits. Shamba adopts a comprehensive strategy to mitigate financial risks associated with climate change, foster sustainable practices, and address environmental concerns. Notably, the project has aided over 10,000 farmers in Kenya, with the majority of their funding to date coming from Gitcoin Grants.

**Senken**

Senken’s aim was to build a regenerative finance marketplace that allowed companies to easily invest in carbon offsets and enter the voluntary carbon markets in the most frictionless way possible. It wasn’t an easy road but from a mere idea, that was in part fueled by Gitcoin grants, to, in 2023, helping 367 companies invest in climate projects, Senken is now a prominent expert in the field and trusted by world leading companies.

Senken has created an easy-to-use platform to access the largest selection of climate assets for transparent climate actions and finance. To ensure the quality and integrity of each project, Senken provides additional security and transparency at the data level for verifiable climate impact, purchase, trade and carbon credit retirement to meet the company’s emission offset needs.

**ReFi DAO**

Regenerative Finance is a field of finance that seeks to create economic systems, practices, and strategies that support regenerative and restorative outcomes in ecological and social systems. ReFi DAO's mission is to be a pivotal catalyst in the widespread implementation and adoption of ReFi through a combination of movement-wide, knowledge sharing, opportunity development, fundraising support, onboarding and community empowerment. Aiming to show the power of mission-driven communities, distributed technology and regenerative economics to solve the most pressing challenges of our time.

ReFi DAO has now supported over 300 founders, held 27 events across the globe, reached 50k downloads on the ReFi Podcast, and grown their online community to thousands of members.

## Gitcoin Essential Intents

We recognize that these Essential Intents guide Gitcoin. Our work is aligned and will help drive these Essential Intents.

**Network Effects - Maximizing the network effects of our ecosystem to grow product adoption**

The climate round has built a vibrant community of grantees and supporters. As some grantees have begun to graduate from the round, some have already expressed interest in running their own grant rounds for their specific communities. By funding CCN and the Climate program, we will continue to grow our community and grow usage and adoption of Gitcoin’s products.

**Community First - Cultivating a community that thrives on providing positive change and meaningful engagement**

While Gitcoin ran the Climate program, this essential intent has always been one of our north stars. We have cultivated a rich community of builders and educators all with a mission of making the world a better place through the fight against climate change. These grantees are all making positive changes in the world and engaging with the broader Gitcoin community. CCN is aligned with this, and building and cultivating our community will always be one of the drivers of how we operate.

**Financial Longevity - Ensuring the economic health and vitality of Gitcoin**

While we recognize that this proposal requests funds, we hope to be one of the many community rounds paying fees to Gitcoin to run our rounds on the GS platform. In addition, as noted above, we also anticipate grantee communities within the round to begin running their own rounds, which will also produce fees back to Gitcoin.

            <p>Surprised that GitCoin isn’t more reticent about funding here given the level of outright fraud and grift that is going on with a number of these projects - funding should be contingent on flushing out the projects that have broken the rules.</p>
<p>In the short term it may be painful to call these out and excise them from our communities but the bigger picture is that this is only going to get worse. This is a terrible look for all of us.</p>

It uses the matching pool funds that were raised specifically for climate funds to continue to be used for the original purpose by a team dedicated to that cause.

<h2><a name="a-few-of-many-success-stories-3" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#a-few-of-many-success-stories-3"></a>A few of Many Success Stories</h2>
<p><strong>Shamba Network</strong></p>
<p>Situated in Nairobi, Kenya, Shamba Network utilizes blockchain technology, remote sensing, and statistical sampling to tackle financial inclusion and climate change challenges in sub-Saharan Africa. With a primary focus on assisting smallholder farmers, Shamba advocates for sustainable agriculture and employs blockchain for access to emerging financial landscapes, such as climate insurance and carbon markets.</p>
<p>Through the implementation of ecological data oracles and smart contracts, Shamba streamlines processes related to climate insurance, leading to large cost reductions. The initiative collaborates with various Web 3 climate solutions to establish a more extensive ecosystem and is actively striving to empower smallholder farming communities to issue their own carbon credits. Shamba adopts a comprehensive strategy to mitigate financial risks associated with climate change, foster sustainable practices, and address environmental concerns. Notably, the project has aided over 10,000 farmers in Kenya, with the majority of their funding to date coming from Gitcoin Grants.</p>
<p><strong>Senken</strong></p>
<p>Senken’s aim was to build a regenerative finance marketplace that allowed companies to easily invest in carbon offsets and enter the voluntary carbon markets in the most frictionless way possible. It wasn’t an easy road but from a mere idea, that was in part fueled by Gitcoin grants, to, in 2023, helping 367 companies invest in climate projects, Senken is now a prominent expert in the field and trusted by world leading companies.</p>
<p>Senken has created an easy-to-use platform to access the largest selection of climate assets for transparent climate actions and finance. To ensure the quality and integrity of each project, Senken provides additional security and transparency at the data level for verifiable climate impact, purchase, trade and carbon credit retirement to meet the company’s emission offset needs.</p>
<p><strong>ReFi DAO</strong></p>
<p>Regenerative Finance is a field of finance that seeks to create economic systems, practices, and strategies that support regenerative and restorative outcomes in ecological and social systems. ReFi DAO’s mission is to be a pivotal catalyst in the widespread implementation and adoption of ReFi through a combination of movement-wide, knowledge sharing, opportunity development, fundraising support, onboarding and community empowerment. Aiming to show the power of mission-driven communities, distributed technology and regenerative economics to solve the most pressing challenges of our time.</p>
<p>ReFi DAO has now supported over 300 founders, held 27 events across the globe, reached 50k downloads on the ReFi Podcast, and grown their online community to thousands of members.</p>
<h2><a name="gitcoin-essential-intents-4" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#gitcoin-essential-intents-4"></a>Gitcoin Essential Intents</h2>
<p>We recognize that these Essential Intents guide Gitcoin. Our work is aligned and will help drive these Essential Intents.</p>
<p><strong>Network Effects - Maximizing the network effects of our ecosystem to grow product adoption</strong></p>
<p>The climate round has built a vibrant community of grantees and supporters. As some grantees have begun to graduate from the round, some have already expressed interest in running their own grant rounds for their specific communities. By funding CCN and the Climate program, we will continue to grow our community and grow usage and adoption of Gitcoin’s products.</p>
<p><strong>Community First - Cultivating a community that thrives on providing positive change and meaningful engagement</strong></p>
<p>While Gitcoin ran the Climate program, this essential intent has always been one of our north stars. We have cultivated a rich community of builders and educators all with a mission of making the world a better place through the fight against climate change. These grantees are all making positive changes in the world and engaging with the broader Gitcoin community. CCN is aligned with this, and building and cultivating our community will always be one of the drivers of how we operate.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Longevity - Ensuring the economic health and vitality of Gitcoin</strong></p>
<p>While we recognize that this proposal requests funds, we hope to be one of the many community rounds paying fees to Gitcoin to run our rounds on the GS platform. In addition, as noted above, we also anticipate grantee communities within the round to begin running their own rounds, which will also produce fees back to Gitcoin.</p>
