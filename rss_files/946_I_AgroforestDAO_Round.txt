I AgroforestDAO Round
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/i-agroforestdao-round/19781
    We have just finished distributing the funds of AgroforestDAOâ€™s first Quadratic Funding Round. This round was focused on apprentices that went through the AgroforestDAO Journey, a 6 weeks learning experience that happened in September and where we presented examples of regen web3 coordination and tools being used by our DAO, such as individual and collective wallets, POAPs, NFT certificates and the Gitcoin Passport. We also helped them to donate in GG22, and to create profiles in our Charmverse workspace, as a way to coordinate by following each otherâ€™s milestones and updates while recognizing their completion with impact atestations.

The round ran from 9-19th of December on Celo blockchain. It was operated by GreenPill Brazil and AgroforestDAO and had a matching pool of 3.500 USDGLO, with GreenPill Brazil, AgroforestDAO and Regen Coordination providing 1.000 USDGLO each and Kolektivo and Kokonut network supporting with 300 USDGLO and 200 USDGLO respectivelly. There were 285 donations estimated in 653,25 usd, made by 32 unique contributors, with an average contribution of 20 usd. There were a total of 14 projects, 13 grantees and 1 collective governance experiment that is a multisig with the apprentices as signers.

The round used a blend of QF and COCM and had as operators Caue Thomaz (Coi - GreenPill Brazil), Monty Merlin (Regen Coordination) Diogo Jorge, Athus and Deroila (AgroforestDAO) and as advisor Sov (Gitcoin).

Highlights from the round were the solidarity seen among grantees, which they helped each other to apply, specially those late in the application schedule. Grantees got involved, created Twitter profiles (not a very common SM in Brazil), joined Twitter Spaces to present their projects and shared the round in their other SM accounts. The round results seem to have rewarded this engagement and the leading projects were from the people that helped others the most.

These grantees had previously donated both in GG22 and in the Collaborators Round, a test round organized by GPBR and AgroforestDAO. They are the 13 most engaged apprentices from a total of 100 applications for our September Learning Journey. We believe that after this opportunity of being a grantee and getting rewarded made a huge impact on their fresh perceptions about web3 and showed the importance of engaging, coordinating, supporting each other and public goods. Little by little we are building a community capable of validating the stewardship of Food Forest Culture, incentivizing people to engage as a community in such an important human activity often overlooked by markets.

We look forward to granteeâ€™s milestones updates and hope to be able to launch more rounds in 2025.
