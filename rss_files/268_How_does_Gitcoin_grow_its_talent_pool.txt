How does Gitcoin grow its talent pool?
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-does-gitcoin-grow-its-talent-pool/19972
    There's an [interesting discussion](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/a-small-infographic-on-the-topic-of-a-small-talent-pool/19971) in ENS forum about how their Working groups have over time stopped almost all small, entry level, grants and other types of incentives.

This resulted in drastic decrease of the number of unique recipients of funds from the DAO, with even worse impact on the number of first-time recipients.

Gitcoin has had 2 grant rounds for contributors last year:
- Allo Advancement Fund
- Citizens Retro Round

Is there a way for us to see in more detail and in one picture how Gitcoin DAO distributed funds among unique recipients and new contributors? A tool such as [ENS Open Ledger](https://ens-ledger.app/) would be useful here.
