GitcoinDAO Digest Edition #5 2022
DisruptionJoe

            <p>Yes. Maybe there should be an objective voters guide that informs the stewards and community of what is being requested, but not the opinions of one steward.</p>

GitcoinDAO Digest Edition #5 2022
Fred

            <p>Hey Joe,</p>
<p>Great input, AFAIK the Voters-guide-thread is <em>the</em> place to go to participate in a broader discussion around the Season 13 budgets and how they relate to each other. I think that taking a step back and looking at the budgets in a wider context is of great benefit for the Stewards as they review and compare the different proposals.</p>
<p>Maybe I should‚Äôve been more clear that it‚Äôs mainly the <em>discussion</em> I‚Äôm inviting the reader to participate in, as opposed to highlighting the OP as an objective source of truth.</p>

DisruptionJoe

            <p>Hey Fred, Great work as always. One question‚Ä¶ How do we decide who‚Äôs voter guide to put at the top?</p>
<p>This really makes it seem like Kyle‚Äôs voter guide is the opinion of the DAO. Is that the case?</p>
