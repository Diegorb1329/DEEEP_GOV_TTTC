[S16 Proposal] DRAFT FDD Budget Request
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s16-proposal-draft-fdd-budget-request/11821
    This is the draft budget proposal for FDD requesting funding for Season 16 (1 November 2022 through 31 January 2023).


# TL;DR

In Season 16, FDD will focus on building open source fraud defense tools to support the DAOs overall transition to the protocol. It will be done by building on our season 15 hackathon success of starting an engaged open data community, dogfooding our tools during gitcoin-led rounds, and finding sustainable models for continued defense for Gitcoin UI, Gitcoin Grants Program, and Community Grants Programs.

> **We will improve our ability to quickly build modular and composable business intelligence tools which communities can use to reduce fraud, allocate resources better, and promote learning between ecosystems on the new protocol.**

In addition, 

> **... by talking with round owners, we will find sustainable funding options for continuous fraud defense provided by the open data community.**




# Amount

FDD's total Budget Request for S16 is **$349,500**.

This budget does not include the additional 60 days of reserves per season. A breakdown of the budget can be found at the end.

|Gitcoin Season|Season 14|Season 15|Season 16|
|---|---|---|---|
|Season Budget|$330,000|$349,500|$349,500|
|Season Reserves|$220,000| $233,000| $198,349 ***2)***|
|Unspent Reserves % ***1)***|100%|100%|100%|
|Treasury Request |$281,041|$362,500| $384,151|

***1)** The amount of GTC requested and the value of the reserves will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally using the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average, whichever is lower.*

***2)** FDD received $220,000 in reserves at a GTC price of $1.95 in S14. With the GTC price of $1.66, these reserves are worth $198,349. The full amount (100%) will be rolled over to the Season 16 budget request.

[S16 Proposal] DRAFT FDD Budget Request
kyle

            <p>Thanks so much for posting the budget.</p>
<p>I really appreciate the forward looking towards data availability, and also how to find a sustainable model in a Grants Protocol based world (more specifically, a permissionless protocol approach where we don‚Äôt handle sybil defense by default).</p>
<p>FDD is likely overly staffed given we wont be running a round (no new data to analyze or work to do to approve grants, etc.), but I also hope that this gives the team some room to really chart a path of sustainability for how sybil detection is done at scale.</p>

            <p>I would echo what a few others have stated above - super appreciate the value that FDD is creating for the DAO, and I love that the team is doubling down as the go-to resource on data-driven solutions to more than just sybil resistance.</p>
<p>However some of the outcomes mentioned here seem a bit nebulous, especially around the ‚ÄúGrants Protocol Research‚Äù objective, and I‚Äôm also not clear where the demand for some of these initiatives is coming from. As an example, for the project described as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúIdentify and model sustainability mechanisms where supply and demand exists in grants rounds to create experiments leading to sustainability‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôm not convinced if this is a problem the DAO is actively trying to solve/needs to prioritize at the moment; maybe I‚Äôm missing some context here?</p>
<p>Overall in support of this budget and the FDD team continuing to develop itself as a valuable resource to the DAO, but would love to see the budget being a better reflection of our most pressing needs.</p>

epowell101

            <p>I‚Äôm a bit conflicted - as I recently became a part time contributor to FDD.</p>
<p>That said - I feel FDD is extremely aligned w/ the overall purpose of Gitcoin and current focus as far as I understand it.  Specifically - in order to enable communities to fund their shared needs these communities need to both a) have access to the gitcoin protocol and passport and related software and b) possess the expertise necessary to protect and operate those rounds.</p>
<p>FDD has proactively undertaken to decentralize itself - to externalize and grow the data science and related skills it has via hackathons and a nascent community and also by packaging and distributing the anti Sybil legos it has created.</p>
<p>Why is this so important?  It is not much of an overstatement to state that quadratic funding <strong>does not work</strong> without the sort of dual approach to Sybil resistance via passport from the GPC plus anti-Sybil analysis and related data science from FDD.  The data on this point clear - and to me so too is the purpose and the strategy of FDD.</p>
<p>This short note isn‚Äôt intended to substitute for detailed feedback and discussion. Rather I just wanted to add my perspective on the centrality of FDD to Gitcoin‚Äôs purpose and strategy - especially during this transition to a protocol &amp; community based future.</p>

[S16 Proposal] DRAFT FDD Budget Request

            <p>I am excited that FDD‚Äôs S16 budget builds on a number of the wins from S15. These wins include creating a number of new Sybil scoring LEGOS, building an open data community, and formulating service level agreements with others parts of the DAO + round managers. There‚Äôs a lot of great progress FDD is making; your efforts to share that progress with the public is putting Gitcoin at the center of the web3 - Sybil defense discussion.</p>
<p>I have communicated more detailed feedback via Discord, but to summarize my concerns here for other Stewards:</p>
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôd like to see fewer OKRs, but with clearer links to DAO-wide objectives. It may be confusing to Stewards when objectives have more than one Essential Intent (EI) tagged to them.</li>
<li>Some of the KRs feel hard to measure and lack specificity. Similar to <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/lthrift">@lthrift</a>‚Äôs point, research &amp; experimentation should be in the service of building better mechanisms for Passport, Grants Hub, and Round Manager. I‚Äôd like to see measurable KRs that other parts of the DAO (not just FDD) will point to and say, ‚Äúyes, that number is important for us to hit‚Äù.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm worried about workload distribution across the team, particularly the new contributors. Personally, I‚Äôd like to see each contributor taking responsibility for a smallish number of high-impact outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, my worry is that this budget might not gain strong support from Stewards, not because contributors are focused on the wrong things, but because the current presentation requires a fair amount of mental effort / context to understand exactly what FDD is working on and why it‚Äôs essential for the DAO.</p>

[S16 Proposal] DRAFT FDD Budget Request
tigress

            <p>This is the draft budget proposal for FDD requesting funding for Season 16 (1 November 2022 through 31 January 2023).</p>
<h1><a name="tldr-1" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#tldr-1"></a>TL;DR</h1>
<p>In Season 16, FDD will focus on building open source fraud defense tools to support the DAOs overall transition to the protocol. It will be done by building on our season 15 hackathon success of starting an engaged open data community, dogfooding our tools during gitcoin-led rounds, and finding sustainable models for continued defense for Gitcoin UI, Gitcoin Grants Program, and Community Grants Programs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We will improve our ability to quickly build modular and composable business intelligence tools which communities can use to reduce fraud, allocate resources better, and promote learning between ecosystems on the new protocol.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>‚Ä¶ by talking with round owners, we will find sustainable funding options for continuous fraud defense provided by the open data community.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h1><a name="amount-2" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#amount-2"></a>Amount</h1>
<p>FDD‚Äôs total Budget Request for S16 is <strong>$349,500</strong>.</p>
<p>This budget does not include the additional 60 days of reserves per season. A breakdown of the budget can be found at the end.</p>
