### Governance activity during the period:

Steward Council Elections:

We started with +60 potential nominees and narrowed that down to 10 candidates who were willing to serve on the Gitcoin Steward Council. With this cohort we have an exceptionally unique pool of web3, academic, and web2 expertise. Also, thanks to Azeem and Laura who helped other workstreams find great candidates. For additional background on the role of the Steward Council see this presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZZB7J6VrqIT6vZb5GWQiTsglMScQhOd38_m30jYu4Zw/edit?usp=sharing) and the full announcement, nomination, and election results here [Steward Council Elections v3 announcement & election results!](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/steward-council-elections-v3-announcement-election-results/15767)

**A note of thanks:**

As we start up a Steward Council v3, we need to thank our past Council members. This group of 16 people met 2-4 times per month to discuss issues, share results, and gain context as part of this ongoing experiment to provide broader input to Gitcoin Leadership. These participants will be able to claim this soul bound token commemorating their dedication.

![|429x418](upload://e2SckmYZqrz7CQyHkZL8rMClibP.png)

Please give this unique group of leaders a follow on twitter, and thank them for providing guidance to Gitcoin.

### Looking forward – governance recommendations:

In early July I let Kyle and Rena know that I would not be submitting a new funding request for Gitcoin Governance and that I intended to close out my time at Gitcoin with the end of S18. In preparation for this work, I built this summary of suggestions for how Gitcoin could manage Governance, I pledged my support to help transition, and reached out to several Governerds who may be interested in helping. I look forward to playing the role of a more vocal steward as I step down from my governance responsibilities.

            <p><strong>July 10 update:</strong><br>
The Gitcoin Steward Council elections is scheduled to move into nominations this week and we have a exceptionally diverse slate of candidates with a couple more final confirmations coming in.  Once all workstreams are settled on their nominees, we will post up the final list on the forum and move to vote after 5 business days on the forum.</p>
<p><strong>Last week</strong><br>
To note, our snapshot account is not currently calculating final results on our snapshot page, however the results below are calculatable based on the actual votes.  Two votes are impacted by this calculation issue and both votes have closed.  The Snapshot team has identified the issue and is working on a fix.</p>

Governance update: July 2023
shawn16400

            <p><strong>July 03 update:</strong><br>
Governance continued to focus on prepping for the Gitcoin Steward Council elections and working to cement a solid slate of potential candidates.  Ancillary efforts include pushing the development of AI governance summaries and using push protocol to distribute governance content to GTC tokenholders.  We also experienced another Snapshot spam attack where 30+ proposals illustrating the need for tighter Passport controls on who can post proposals on Snapshot.  In the short term, proposal posting has been blocked until we can get the next controls in place.</p>

<p>Steward Council Elections:</p>
<p>We started with +60 potential nominees and narrowed that down to 10 candidates who were willing to serve on the Gitcoin Steward Council. With this cohort we have an exceptionally unique pool of web3, academic, and web2 expertise. Also, thanks to Azeem and Laura who helped other workstreams find great candidates. For additional background on the role of the Steward Council see this presentation <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZZB7J6VrqIT6vZb5GWQiTsglMScQhOd38_m30jYu4Zw/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> and the full announcement, nomination, and election results here <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/steward-council-elections-v3-announcement-election-results/15767">Steward Council Elections v3 announcement &amp; election results!</a></p>

<p><strong>A note of thanks:</strong></p>
<p>As we start up a Steward Council v3, we need to thank our past Council members. This group of 16 people met 2-4 times per month to discuss issues, share results, and gain context as part of this ongoing experiment to provide broader input to Gitcoin Leadership. These participants will be able to claim this soul bound token commemorating their dedication.</p>

<p>In early July I let Kyle and Rena know that I would not be submitting a new funding request for Gitcoin Governance and that I intended to close out my time at Gitcoin with the end of S18. In preparation for this work, I built this summary of suggestions for how Gitcoin could manage Governance, I pledged my support to help transition, and reached out to several Governerds who may be interested in helping. I look forward to playing the role of a more vocal steward as I step down from my governance responsibilities.</p>
