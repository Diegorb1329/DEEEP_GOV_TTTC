            <p>Hey Zer8 feel free to dm me on this. I think it makes total sense to help out with onboarding for now (armand mentioned it to me). For any full-time position we‚Äôre still defining this, but we can definitely keep on chatting!</p>

            <p>Hello Joe, I wonder if this is possible and I just want to ask the following question:</p>
<p>-Could I take on a part time position with Project Management - DAO Operations?</p>
<p>I am currently a Grant Reviews Squad Lead, involved in Policy and also in the Research Group.</p>
<p>You can also count on my for the Onboarding Specialists as it‚Äôs my pleasure to bring new people into Gitcoin DAO. It‚Äôs a natural role for me as I already briefed a lot of folks on what we‚Äôre collectively working at in the FDD, MMM and Moonshot collective streams and directed them to the DAO onboarding procedures afterwards.</p>
<p>I talked with Armand yesterday and he asked if I could help out with the Onboardings. I already told him I would. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=10" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>PS. If I take on a Full time position in Project Management - DAO Operations I am worried that I could not contribute to my full capabilities  in the Policy, Grant Reviews and Research Squads thus my impact will diminish to an extent over there.</p>

            <p>Mostly current. There is a big Notion revamp going on to be launched in a week or two so some may not be updated if anyone thought it was going to be launched sooner. Close enough though.</p>
<p>The new version is going to be much more clear with ‚Äúroles‚Äù as job descriptions clearly linked to the initiatives.</p>
