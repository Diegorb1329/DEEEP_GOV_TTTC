* The workstream is pushing hard this week to hit >$1m in funds raised for the main pool in GR13 alone.
* Forward planning for the library and public goods weekly continues to improve, with guests from across the ecosystem planned for the rest of Q1.
* Several micro-grantees have started to showcase their work. Verses put their latest [drop](https://pluriverse.world/) forward last Wednesday, and Crypto Culture and Society has formally launched [Semester II](https://twitter.com/CryptoSocietyS1/status/1489709838301081613).

### [üöÄ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-prototyping-workstream-moonshot-budget-request-q4-2021/8785) [Moonshot Collective](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Moonshot-Collective-ffa78f44a0de412cb607f9b69d3a376f)

* Kevin‚Äôs talk ‚Äú[Take The Green Pill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP7wqLWV33M)‚Äù in ETHDenver covers our new [GreenPill.Party](https://greenpill.party/) initiative. Are you ready to take the pledge, Anon?

* [Emu](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kdm5126) gave [an update](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/coordination-party-kit/9231/7) on how Moonshot Collective is using its own tools to Tip and Pay our devs. In January 100% of compensation was paid through the tools created within the workstream.

### üíô [Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Fraud-Detection-Defense-2bde13c0b8e74fda81435d94e49e2703)

* Data analysis shows that XGboost ML algorithms perform significantly better than the current random forest model implementation. This discovery is a direct result of the community model squads work.

* Grant reviews are currently happening within 4 days and will be less than 48 hours during the last week before and the first week during GR13. GIA deployment for all reviews is blocked by legal concerns of Gitcoin Holdings.

* Multisig changes are happening as the multisig keyholders which act as oversight of the workstream lean into their role and are actively making adjustments based on the workstream expectations. Our recent additions are going through a nomination and voting process which is being refined.
