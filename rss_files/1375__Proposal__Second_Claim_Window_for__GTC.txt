[Proposal] Second Claim Window for $GTC
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-second-claim-window-for-gtc/7388
    **It has come to my attention that there are some 2,000,000 + $GTC tokens that were unclaimed during the 30 day claim window.** 

Some folks feel it was an unreasonably short amount of time to allow the community to claim their tokens, I'm not here to support one side or the other but I am interested in discovering the will of the community. 

According to @owocki

> we used an Ethereum signed message service to manage the claims, and the team didn't want the liability of running it for more than  30 days.

So those are just facts, and now according to @ceresstation the remaining tokens have been sent to the treasury that is controlled by the existing token holders. 

**So the question is, do we feel that it is reasonable to open up a second claim window for *eligible Gitcoin handles* who missed the drop to claim their $GTC ?** 

I don't want to jump into a vote right away, so I created this post to gather feedback and soft consensus before we move to snap-shot. Please add your thoughts below as we work towards a solution that best serves the interests of the community.

            <p>Oh oops!  Thanks for clarifying Yalor.</p>
<p>I have jumped into a workstream and been helping out with the Anti-sybil group.  It has been busy and enjoyable.   Thanks again for clarifying thingsüôÇ</p>
<p>I say 30 days is more than enough time and you <strong>should not re-open the drop</strong> but should focus on the people currently engaged with Gitcoin.</p>

            <p>You are misunderstanding the topic of this thread, it‚Äôs not about rewarding people who just arrived at Gitcoin, which is definitely going to happen, it‚Äôs about distributing tokens to people who <em>were eligible</em> but missed the airdrop for one reason or another.</p>

<p>However, we can still make the decision to delegate the operation to the Gitcoin team so it literally comes down to the fact that Gitcoin team have no time to do so and I don‚Äôt think this is a type of work that should be delegating to someone else. The communication part cannot be delegated as you can‚Äôt give the email list to stewards either.</p>

[Proposal] Second Claim Window for $GTC
Yalor

            <p>This is the main point I‚Äôm trying to get across, Gitcoin Employees cannot do this, they literally no longer have the power to do so. Nor do they have the bandwidth, the funds are now inside the DAO Treasury, so it is actually up to the stewards.</p>
<p>That being said I think people are massively underestimating the effort required to improve the airdrop rate by 10-20% and missing the opportunity to ensure that these funds are spent on creating value for Gitcoin.</p>
<p>Sure some people missed out and that‚Äôs really unfortunate, what‚Äôs done is done though. We can‚Äôt go back and update the terms of the initial airdrop.</p>
<p>The question we need to ask ourselves now is:</p>
<p><strong>Do we think that sending roughly $12mm In tokens and spending at minimum 2 months of effort organizing these proceedings is going to create an equal amount of value for open-source or public goods ?</strong></p>
<p>Versus finding some way for people to earn those tokens by contributing today ?</p>

</aside>
<p>I must say this is something only Gitcoin employees can do.</p>
<p>Given the initial distribution is done by Gitcoin team, the majority of technical expertise is within the Gitcoin team. I am not sure if anyone would be comfortable enough to let random GTC holder to do such critical work (how do we prevent rug pull by the person leading the stream?) . Also only Gitcoin employees have direct access to emails so communication can literally only be done by the team.</p>
<p>If Gitcoin employees are willing to do the technical work and communication, what else need to be lead?  Sounds like only thing left is to do two voting, the first to decide if we do it or not and then the second is to decide how long (1 month, 1 year, or no deadline) if ‚Äúyes‚Äù wins in the first vote.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I support establishing a second distribution window, only limited to those deserve the gift in question, and only because there are situations where someone may not be able to receive the gift due to extraordinary circumstances. I managed to claim the gift, but at the very last minute - I‚Äôm sympathetic towards those who may have missed the deadline entirely.</p>
<p>But I do not have the technical skills or knowledge for how to <em>organize</em> such a second window.</p>
<p>Even if I did come up with a proper approach for establishing such a window, many GTC-holders would oppose any sort of new claim window, making such an effort rather pointless.</p>
<p>I suspect most of the pro-‚Äúsecond airdrop‚Äù people are in the same boat.</p>
<p>If we cannot solve this past mistake, then I don‚Äôt think we can credibly say that we are on the ‚Äúright track‚Äù. If the community cannot disincentive itself from making mistakes, they will certainly make them again. There will be no reason to fix shortcomings, so they will be no improvements made.</p>
<p>That being said, I can understand arguments about it not being a good ROI for the project as a whole, or how increasing the $GTC claim rate by merely 20% might not be worthwhile. Therefore, it‚Äôs probably a good idea to move forward. But this is still a shortcoming, and we should strive to do better next time.</p>

            <p>I have seen a lot of ‚Äúyes‚Äù ‚Äúno‚Äù ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù responses here, which is great because it sparks conversation around what we might do moving forward or how we might remedy the situation for those people who feel that the claim window was unreasonably short. <strong>What I don‚Äôt see is anyone who is qualified or willing to lead the effort in creating the second distribution window‚Ä¶</strong></p>
<p>If I‚Äôm mistaken please by all mean chime in here, but at this moment I don‚Äôt see this proposal having enough support to move to a snapshot vote. I want to avoid the situation where people are voting for something they don‚Äôt have the full details on.</p>
<p>If anyone is willing to put together a reasonable and well thought out proposal and lead the effort that would be required to organize this second claim window please speak up.</p>
<p>Just saying "<em>Gitcoin should do this"</em> is not a suitable response <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/man_shrugging/3.png?v=9" title=":man_shrugging:t3:" class="emoji" alt=":man_shrugging:t3:"></p>
<p>We are all Gitcoin now <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smirk.png?v=9" title=":smirk:" class="emoji" alt=":smirk:">, your voice matters, and your efforts count as much, if not more, then the Gitcoin Core Team !</p>
<p>That being said, I brought up this topic of discussion to get a better perspective on the situation but I have no intention of leading the effort to make it come to fruition. I don‚Äôt have the time and I don‚Äôt honestly see the ROI from investing time here that could be spent in other areas of Gitcoin that need support and guidance from the Stewards.</p>
<p>I would encourage people to look forward, not backwards and find a way to become part of one of the existing work-streams, start earning $GTC, and in no time at all you will make up for the $GTC you lost by missing the airdrop.</p>
<p>Lastly I think it‚Äôs important to keep in mind, an airdrop is a <strong>gift</strong> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/gift.png?v=9" title=":gift:" class="emoji" alt=":gift:"> not an expectation. Gitcoin provides valuable services to the community of open-source developers and digital creatives, one that funds literally 100‚Äôs of projects quarterly.</p>
<p>We want to focus on that kind of impact, we won‚Äôt get it right ‚Äúevery time‚Äù but if we can strive to improve from our short-comings then we are on the right track <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/pray/3.png?v=9" title=":pray:t3:" class="emoji" alt=":pray:t3:"></p>

            <p>" and the team didn‚Äôt want the liability of running it for more than 30 days"‚Ä¶</p>
<p>So, is there any way to know what ‚Äúthe team‚Äù that made the decision to impose a 30 day limit - was concerned about in terms of ‚Äúliability‚Äù?  I think that info would be of value, especially if another claim window were to open ‚Äì because it will eventually need to close and if 30 days wasn‚Äôt long enough last time, we should know what liability exists should there be a clear interest in going beyond 30 days the next time around.</p>

            <p>I am very happy. I got the GTC reward from gitcoin, but my friend was unable to get the reward because his account was suspended by github. He did not do anything illegal. The reply github gave him was that his github account was only used for Link to a third-party platform (gitcoin), so to suspend it, I think we must consider this issue.</p>

            <p>I think it is necessary to do these things. GITCOIN supporters are the most important. If people who cannot apply for airdrops for various reasons have a chance to get airdrops, then they will be loyal fans of GITCOIN. Everyone Contributions are indelible.</p>

            <p>My question is how many times we have informed users about the claim timeline?<br>
How long between first remind mail and second or third remind mail?</p>

            <p>I don‚Äôt think the second requirement is necessary.  Mail has been notified many times, accounts that do not claim at the right time may be due to not paying attention to mail and in this day and age, not tracking your mail means that the account is a clone.</p>

            <p>Yes, even though I received the tokens, the official still sent me an email to ask me to claim it. Finally, they sent me an email every few days. They didn‚Äôt pay much attention to gtc.</p>
