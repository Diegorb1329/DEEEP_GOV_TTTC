For context:
This round was made possible because 5 individuals donated $1000 each to crowdfund the necessary matching funds to apply as a community round, then Gitcoin matched that with more funds.
Huge thanks to:

Reflections:

-Adding images is really time consuming and difficult. Heading to imgbb.com and copying URL to input markdown formatting of ![imagename]imageurl.png is a pain. Would be ideal if there was an "insert image" button somehow
But including the images seemed really important so people could know who are the kids who are supporting

-Did a google form for applications and then I manually added those projects onchain, which took way more time than expected. Would be ideal if we could have web2 login so people could make a profile and then we had gasless transactions for them creating their project in builder. We had grantees who had enough crypto knowledge to receive funds, but not enough to figure out gas and switching chains and such. 
A few projects which applied directly that I could just approve within manager felt like a sigh of relief compared to manually making them myself. 

-Having a checkbox or space for donors to share their email with the project they are donating so that project can send them updates could be really valuable for grantees

-I don't think people really used the call links and scheduled calls that much to directly talk with the grantees and meet the communities they support. Perhaps when we ask grantees for their updates we'll ask about that. Still wondering about best ways to form real long-term relationships between donors and grantees. 

I really wish there was a way to have referrals/vouching/attestation of whether people see a project as ligit. I find myself relying on proxies like whether they were in previous rounds, if mutuals follow them on twitter, and such info which seems rather shallow when making the important decision of who will get funding. 

Definitely took up lots of time to set up calls with every applicant, but also was inspiring and encouraging hearing about all the various great projects. A few projects involved education at schools around Africa for how to do regen agriculture which perhaps overlapped with the theme for this round and also ma earth. 

Also very impressed with @MathildaDV 's thoughtful questions getting feedback from my experience when we had the pleasure to meet in Bangkok around Devcon

I plan to send out a google form for the grantees to share how they used the funds. Looking forward to hearing about this impact!

I also recently had the joy of returning to Ava's House kids shelter by Chiang Mai Thailand (https://avahouse.org/) and seeing the awesome project Dang and his wife have made taking care of 25 kids, built a whole new building, repaired water tanks, and I'm so inspired by the work they do.

I plan to be back in January to visit New Hope Shelter in Ecuador (@newhopeshelter on x) and see how the community is doing including Damaris who is in process of being adopted

Incredibly glad to know this awesome ecosystem and mechanism for funding kids shelters and educational projects :)

            <p>IMPACT REPORT<br>
Project: Adopt a Tree<br>
Date: November 2024 to February 2025<br>
Grant Amount: $379.41<br>
Funding Source: Youth In Need on GG22<br>
Introduction<br>
With the generous support of this $379.41 grant, our project continues to educate children about climate change and the importance of planting trees. This funding allowed us to engage the young minds in hands-on learning experiences, planting trees and empowering them to become environmental stewards in their communities.<br>
Use of Funds<br>
The grant was allocated as follows:<br>
Tree Saplings and Seeds – $160 (Purchased and distributed for hands-on planting activities)<br>
Educational Materials – $100 (Printed guides, posters, and activity booklets)<br>
Gardening materials – $80 (Soil preparation, compost, biodegradable pots, and gardening tools)<br>
Logistics and communication – $40 (Transportation and light snacks for children during sessions)<br>
Impact Achieved<br>
Engaged 56 Children: Conducted interactive climate education in schools, educating 56 children on climate change, deforestation and sustainable agriculture.<br>
Planted Trees: Children planted 112 saplings in their schools and communities, they planted one tree at school and another one at school. Teachers too planted 20 trees and both the teachers and children received firsthand education about reforestation.<br>
Educational Outreach: We provided climate change booklets and activity guides to reinforce learning beyond the workshops. These booklets helped the parents in learning about climate change and the importance of planting trees.<br>
Community Engagement: Partnered with local educators and parents, fostering a community-wide commitment to sustainability.<br>
Future Plans<br>
This grant has been instrumental in advancing our mission. With additional funding, we aim to expand to more schools, create digital learning tools and establish a student-led tree nursery. We also intend to involve the parents and plant the trees around the school communities. We also plant to integrate a reward system for planting of trees.<br>
Gratitude &amp; Conclusion<br>
We are deeply grateful for this support. We thank Noah Chon Lee for considering this project for funding. The grant has empowered children to take meaningful action against climate change and inspired a new generation of environmental leaders. We also served them a meal of boiled maize and beans (githeri)…they were so thankful.<br>

<p>Apart from Mr. Nuoi’s house project, we have also disbursed funds to the following parties: - The Together Fund to celebrate Tet with 200 households in Na Bung (Dien Bien Phu, the remotest area in the far west of the Northern mountains) with the amount of 10,000,000 VND. On January 3, 2025, we will go with the brothers and sisters from the Together Fund to Dien Bien to directly deliver gifts to the people there. - The Highland Book Fund is preparing to build 3 kindergartens for the 13th time in 2025 with the amount of 28,000,000 VND, expected to be inaugurated in late May or early June 2025. - The remaining 9 million VND in the fund is planned to buy bicycles as gifts for 5 excellent students from disadvantaged families without means of transport in Phu Vang district, Thua Thien Hue province this December. We will post these three sections in subsequent posts. We are very happy that up to this point, with only 200 million VND, we have been able to do many wonderful things together: building houses, contributing to school construction, buying Tet gifts, and buying bicycles for the students! We will update and provide a financial statement after disbursing for the 5 bicycles and settling the remaining amount for Mr. Nuoi’s house (16 million VND)!</p>

<p>For context:<br>
This round was made possible because 5 individuals donated $1000 each to crowdfund the necessary matching funds to apply as a community round, then Gitcoin matched that with more funds.<br>
Huge thanks to:<br>

<p>Reflections:</p>
<p>-Adding images is really time consuming and difficult. Heading to <a href="http://imgbb.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">imgbb.com</a> and copying URL to input markdown formatting of ![imagename]imageurl.png is a pain. Would be ideal if there was an “insert image” button somehow<br>
But including the images seemed really important so people could know who are the kids who are supporting</p>
<p>-Did a google form for applications and then I manually added those projects onchain, which took way more time than expected. Would be ideal if we could have web2 login so people could make a profile and then we had gasless transactions for them creating their project in builder. We had grantees who had enough crypto knowledge to receive funds, but not enough to figure out gas and switching chains and such.<br>
A few projects which applied directly that I could just approve within manager felt like a sigh of relief compared to manually making them myself.</p>
<p>-Having a checkbox or space for donors to share their email with the project they are donating so that project can send them updates could be really valuable for grantees</p>
<p>-I don’t think people really used the call links and scheduled calls that much to directly talk with the grantees and meet the communities they support. Perhaps when we ask grantees for their updates we’ll ask about that. Still wondering about best ways to form real long-term relationships between donors and grantees.</p>
<p>I really wish there was a way to have referrals/vouching/attestation of whether people see a project as ligit. I find myself relying on proxies like whether they were in previous rounds, if mutuals follow them on twitter, and such info which seems rather shallow when making the important decision of who will get funding.</p>
<p>Definitely took up lots of time to set up calls with every applicant, but also was inspiring and encouraging hearing about all the various great projects. A few projects involved education at schools around Africa for how to do regen agriculture which perhaps overlapped with the theme for this round and also ma earth.</p>
<p>Also very impressed with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/mathildadv">@MathildaDV</a> 's thoughtful questions getting feedback from my experience when we had the pleasure to meet in Bangkok around Devcon</p>
<p>I plan to send out a google form for the grantees to share how they used the funds. Looking forward to hearing about this impact!</p>
<p>I also recently had the joy of returning to Ava’s House kids shelter by Chiang Mai Thailand (<a href="https://avahouse.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://avahouse.org/</a>) and seeing the awesome project Dang and his wife have made taking care of 25 kids, built a whole new building, repaired water tanks, and I’m so inspired by the work they do.<br>
