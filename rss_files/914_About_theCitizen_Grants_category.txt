The program is currently divided into three pillars:

* **Citizens Retro:** Our retroactive rewards program focuses on rewarding Citizens retroactively for their contributions to the Gitcoin ecosystem. Participants must meet eligibility criteria in order to participate.
* **Citizens Innovate:** Community-led ideas on achieving the DAO‚Äôs goals. Proposals take the form of Gitcoin Community Proposals (GCPs).
* **Citizens Forward:** DAO-led initiatives calling for Citizen contributions. Similar to RFPs, budgeted DAO units can allocate parts of their budgets toward specific projects they‚Äôd like to see created/built/fulfilled on.
