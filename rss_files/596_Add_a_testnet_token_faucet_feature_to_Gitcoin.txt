Add a testnet token faucet feature to Gitcoin
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/add-a-testnet-token-faucet-feature-to-gitcoin/11511
    Hi there guys :wave: 

Today, it's always a PITA to get testnet tokens (like Goerli ETH). To the degree that, personally, I ended up "buying" (!!) some Goerli ETH to someone who had a bunch... to save time and preserve my mental health :sweat_smile: 

The problem is that faucets are being emptied by bots all the time so faucet providers restrict in extreme ways how many tokens can be withdrawn because, besides a google captcha, they don't know how to fight bots.

This seems like something that's right in Gitcoin's alley! We could add a faucet feature to gitcoin to help devs access the most "popular" testnet tokens without having to wait days to amass barely 1 testnet ETH :grimacing: 

Basically, the faucet would be "Gitcoin passport protected". Each passported user could withdraw up to 10 testnet ETH per month for example, immediately, no questions asked :) 

Given the amount of devs on Gitcoin, I think it would be very successful and would on-board many devs on Gitcoin passport. Wdyt?

            <p><a href="https://unitap.app/gas-faucet" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Unitap</a> exists for this purpose. They are also open to faucets that are gated by holding certain tokens‚Äìso we could ask for a faucet specifically for the Gitcoin community.</p>

            <p>[IDEA Update] we could also make the withdraw rule even more efficient to prevent the faucet to be emptied too fast and to benefit the community of GTC holders:</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou cannot retrieve more testnet tokens than you have GTC tokens in your wallet, with an upper limit of 100 testnet tokens‚Äù</p>
<p>That‚Äôs only an example that needs to be refined but you get the idea:<br>
‚ÄúThe faucet is reserved to the Gitcoin community. All you need is to be passported and hold some GTC‚Äù Less open but totally fair imho.</p>
