https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-should-i-change-my-delegations-q2-2022/10828
    not sure how many ppl saw it, but i recently posted [about my delegations in GitcoinDAO](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-steward-report-cards/8712/20) üëá

[quote="owocki, post:20, topic:8712"]
here are my current delegations along with comments per delegatee.

![Screen Shot 2022-07-06 at 12.15.12 PM|690x493](upload://2srT1SgEIlrRrvL6eHr51X1myPk.jpeg)

next season, i would like to delegate away from this current group + more broadly to people who:

1. have deep context.
2. good judgement.
3. are damage dealers.
4. help bring the fire around the fire
5. have good pulse on Grants 2.0.
6. want to help push governance/resource allocation at GitcoinDAO forward to be more effective.
7. will stick around to see through the DAO survive the bear market + into the next market cycle.
[/quote]

i would like to solicit feedback from you all about how i should change my delegations for S15.  pls fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/6dkw2P9ybvvepznA6) if you have feedback for me (anon responses ok).  or if you can comment below as long as your comment meets the [forum guidelines and code of conduct](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/forum-guidelines-and-code-of-conduct/758/163).

**for other ppl who have over 20k (ish) worth of GTC**:, id love if you posted a similar transparency report about who you delegate to and why.  i thikn doing so will create a proactive conversation about how we give feedback, cultivate leadership (esp what we look for in leadres), & decentralize power at gitcoindao (and probably prevent help hone some delegations)

            <p>Just catching up on this thread. We are pushing out score breakdown in a week that explains how scores were calculated, it is non-trivial, so took some time. But I want to make the dashboard work to answer your question, so emailing you right now <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p>Definitely agreed. For my part, I‚Äôm not sure who are actually the largest token holders of GTC and where to get that information (I believe there is a Dune dashboard somewhere‚Ä¶but this information is not really advertised).</p>

            <p>One more point: Looks like <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s17-proposal-draft-gitcoin-passport-budget-request/12727">draft budgets for this season are being put up</a> now.  And I‚Äôm the only GTC holder who‚Äôs posted their delegations.  I‚Äôm happy to be held to a high transparency standard, but I‚Äôm not even the largest token holder.  If y‚Äôall are going to hold me up to a standard of transparency (and progressive decentralization) it‚Äôd be nice if other GTC holders (especially large ones) were held to those standards too.</p>

<p>short term,</p>
<ol>
<li>i delegated heavily to janine, kyle, olsen, and griff because Gitcoin is in a place of change into a protocolDAO and i see these people actively helping create clarity there.</li>
<li>i delegated to griff because I admire what Giveth has done in the space, especially how quickly they iterate, and i‚Äôd welcome his presence stewarding Gitcoin.</li>

<p>I dont have a super formalized list of criteria mapped out.  Which is why I think maybe sounding it out on a product-design call might be fruitful.</p>

</aside>
<p>I may offer my thoughts on this one ^^ I definitely agree that people who are active in meta governance are good people to governance people. They are not the only people to delegate too, and those building the DAO likely are also good candidates. The same way we need a plurality or stamps in passport, we need a plurality of voices helping us govern.</p>

<p>Hey Kyle,<br>
Good question, and thanks for asking.  The more eyes on the health cards the better.  The algorithm was define here <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-steward-health-cards-2-0/10418" class="inline-onebox">Introducing Steward Health Cards 2.0</a>.  The case you describe is caused by two variables. 1) the voting participation and 2) the forum participation.</p>
<p>If you compare, both ‚Äúforum scores‚Äù are pretty close, but the real inequity is caused by the voting percentage.  Any new person who successfully participates in a one snapshot vote after declaring stewardship can receive an artificially higher score given their vote participation is 100% as compared to someone who may have participated in many votes, but missed a few. Given we do not have many votes, it can take a long time for this metric to normalize.</p>
<p>We just launched this new site on Tuesday of last week.  The new site is hosted by <a href="https://www.karmahq.xyz/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">karmahq</a> which reduces Gitcoin maintenance of json files, eliminates Gitcoin database hosting, and allows us to take advantage of improvements Karma rolls our across their user base.  We decided to minimize any algorithmic changes in the upgrade to keep it simple, but we did experiment with score appreciation / depreciation over time to try to address that issue.  It worked in some cases, but not with others.</p>
<p>The S17 plan for DAO ops has a line item specifically for this issue where I would like to bring Gitcoin in line with other DAOs using this ranking system.<br>

<p>Yes! this is one of our first enhancements we are asking for from our friends at Karmahq.xyz in addition to revising the algorithm.  You can see issues 17 &amp; 18 in our tracking sheet here from S16, but any of the undone work will be migrated to the S17 tracker once we get that work under way.  In about a day.</p>

            <p>A) it‚Äôs a six month view<br>
B) it‚Äôs a stewards report card not a DAO contributor report card; as such it is about engagement w governance via the forums and voting afaik and not for example bugs opened or closed<br>
C) your comment sort of says a lot - if folks don‚Äôt know about this effort to somehow judge stewardship and how it is calculated, that‚Äôs probably why it doesn‚Äôt seem to be correlated with delegations</p>

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a><br>
Thanks for the chance to connect last Friday and earlier today. It is always good to talk face to face (virtually) for sticky issues.</p>
<p>We agree decentralization in the DAO is the ideal state and we should work for that.  There are many layers of decentralization (token holder governance, workstream governance, computation, development, economics)  However the most pressing need is ensuring work streams are delivering as expected and that we find a way to combat monolithic inertia.  This could look like budget process changes, org adjustments, or clarity on milestones.  But that is one of the larger issues to tackle vs. decentralization.</p>
<p>We also agreed to continue the dialogue and that it was a solid learning experience on both sides.  Thanks for that : )</p>

            <p>Maybe use something like this to delegate your GTC <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a> <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle">@kyle</a> ?</p>
<p>I‚Äôm in a similar boat to <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/shawn16400">@shawn16400</a> - lots of effort (not as much as him to be clear) - obsessing about the DAO in most waking hours (and the ODC as well these days) - PLUS was voted recently to be a Steward council member and yet ‚Üí very small delegation if any.</p>
<p>I probably need to campaign for it and/or earn it over time.  All fair.</p>
<p>In any case, currently, one could argue that we have a bit of governance theater. The contrast between the variety of voices and perspectives and the concentration of decision-making power is fairly stark.</p>

            <p>To clarify, I thought it was obvious that this move is actually decentralizing as well as transparent and therefore is NOT a sybil attack (‚Ä¶and ok to poke fun). It is ironic that you have to split to different wallets to do this with the governor contract as is.</p>

How should I change my delegations? [Q2 2022]
chaselb

            <p>I agree with the assessment you‚Äôve made. For context (for owocki), I‚Äôm a new steward particularly interested in governance and decentralized organizing, and it seems that there‚Äôs a lack of priority of decentralizing token-delegation (or even the holding of tokens). From my perspective so far, it seems like decentralization as an organization is a vision of Gitcoin‚Äôs and Gitcoin contributors, but there does not seem to be much urgency or energy in making it happen. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Token governance is understood by many to be highly susceptible to centralized capture, but there‚Äôs relatively little conversation about eventually switching from this model</li>
<li>Token delegations (and perhaps token ownership) are heavily concentrated in a few people, but calls to try and improve this (like transparent posts such owocki‚Äôs quarterly ‚Äúchange my delegation‚Äù) get few responses</li>
</ul>
<p>Some guesses as to why this might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>No clear future vision of decentralization to buy into. As opposed to an org like Optimism, which explicitly formed with the intent to experiment and iterate on decentralized governance, GitcoinDAO perhaps has some uncertainty as to what decentralization should look like for us and why</li>
<li>Perhaps token decentralization seems less important than the decentralization of influence and process. As in, we should focus on how the DAO is actually organized first (stewards, workstreams, CSDO, etc.), then figure out how we should formally govern it later</li>
<li>People just assume someone else will handle it, and/or don‚Äôt feel like they have the expertise to contribute. Decentralization is a TASK right now. Choosing who to delegate to, or trying to provide input on who large token holders should delegate to, requires thoughtful research into Stewards‚Äô activity within the DAO.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite this, I do think decentralization is extremely worthwhile, especially since we are explicitly aiming for ubiquity for the our products (passport and grants). The goal for the passport protocol is to have 90% of marketshare for DID web3 solutions. That kind of ubiquity is dangerous without proper community governance in my opinion.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>Forgive me as I seek to understand, but it sounds like you are saying the current delegation to the largest voters are coming from another source? If that is the case, I guess it is interesting, but does not change the reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôm saying that I have less than 10% of the GTC circulating supply - and I delegate all of it!</p>
<p>The reality is there is a great deal of room for improvement in terms of other stakeholders participating in governance. I obviously care about Gitcoin and its mission, having built it from scratch nearly 6(!) years ago and now focused on Supermodular and Greenpill and other regenerative projects with similar north stars - that‚Äôs exactly why I‚Äôll continue to be transparent in my delegations. At the end of the day, I am just one node on the network (albeit an og one) - there is another ~90% of GTC out there by circulating supply (~95% by total supply) whose delegations could be updated.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>my GTC is a single digit percentage of the circulating supply. so i have no ability to centralize governance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, this is an assumption on my part. My assumption is that the bulk of delegation to the 4-5-6 active voters who regularly make up the &gt;50% of GTC votes is from you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôm not sure who the ‚Äú4-5-6 active voters who regularly make up the &gt;50% of GTC votes‚Äù are. According to Tally, the top 5 delegates have ~ 6.9m GTC in voting power from ~900 different addresses. (I don‚Äôt even delegate to all 5 of them though)  Those 5 delegates, at ~6.9 GTC represent 900 addresses and about 10% of the circulating supply of GTC.  And about ~30% of the voting supply.</p>
<p>If you want to see who I am delegating to or do the math on your own, I just posted my Q1 2023 delegations <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-should-i-change-my-delegations-q1-2023/12693">here</a>.</p>

<p>for the avoidance of doubt, the only way to decentralize delegations with the GTC Governor contract is to have multiple wallets‚Ä¶  that is why i have to manage multiple wallets.</p>
<p>i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair or a good faith argument to imply this is a sybil attack as there is no marginal return to making new wallets (governance is not quadratic).  and the whole thread is about decentralizing delegations (which requires multiple wallets).</p>

<p>I am not sure if [others have an essential intent to <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/does-the-dao-need-a-decentralization-essential-intent/11228">decentralized governance power or not </a>, but if they do, this feels like a meaningful milestone to pursue as <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/knowledge-transfer-the-gitcoin-hyperstructure/11335">the product decentralizes into a platform</a>.</p>
<p>I think there is something elegant and poetic about the <strong>decentralization of governance power</strong> happening in tandem with the <strong>decentralization of the product</strong>. I also think that decentralizing governance is wayyy less risky when there isnt a complicated product rollout coming up on the roadmap (<a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/does-the-dao-need-a-decentralization-essential-intent/11228/5">read this post to see why</a>). so I think I‚Äôd like tie the two milestones together and set a goal for myself to reach the target when Grants 2.0 launches.</p>
<p>I think that I can manage enough wallets operationally to make this happen I think. But I WILL need to know who delegates 20-50 are going to be to reach this target. So please continue recommending delegates to me!</p>
<p>To get to 50 delegates im going to need to know about up &amp; coming talent in the DAO. so reminder -<br>

</aside>
<p>My view is that the lack of protocol/market fit + lack of sustainability of Gitcoin are larger and more imminent threats.  There are already essential intents covering those problems, but I‚Äôm unsure what progress has been made against them.</p>
<p>As someone who has been outside the DAO for about 6 months now, it‚Äôs really really hard to see the progress being made/roadmap for making progress from the outside.  And even if I could understand the progress, the workstreams are relatively ungovernable because they are large, centralized, monolithic, and there is no alternative to each workstreams governance proposal each quarter. This kind of reminds me how the old product was unmaintainable because it was so large, centralized, and monolithic and there was no alternative to it.  Because of this, most of my delegates are insiders who can understand the nuances of each proposal.  I think I‚Äôve seen some action towards more decentralized thin workstreams or pods, maybe that will create some change.</p>
<p>If people think steward centralization or workstream centralization is problem above other problems, then check out this post <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/does-the-dao-need-a-decentralization-essential-intent/11228">suggesting a decentralization essential intent</a>.</p>

How should I change my delegations? [Q2 2022]
shawn16400

            <p>I am a 1/2 time contributor who has been at Gitcoin since August.  But I think a lot about governance and here are my observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gitcoin voting is centralized.  Four, 5 or 6 of the largest stewards deliver &gt;50% of any given vote.</li>
<li>Gitcoin token governance is limited to budget proposals four times per year.  On occasion, there are other proposals made, but they are limited to about 1 or 2 per quarter.</li>
<li>We recruit, onboard, and inform stewards what is happening, but we don‚Äôt ask our stewards to help make decisions.  And when we do, their vote is - provocatively stated - kind of meaningless.</li>
<li>For example, I am a steward.  I have bought or earned each of my 21K tokens I vote with, and my tokens earn me 0.01% of share of voice when compared to just one of the largest delegates.  Why do I bother voting?</li>
</ol>
<p>Is any of this viewed as a problem for Gitcoin?  I do not know.  <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a>, to your point there was little pull on your ‚Äúdecentralization‚Äù prompt back in August, and my efforts to nudge us towards decentralization have had little traction.   Might be that everyone is comfortable with the patina of decentralization, maybe no one realizes how centralized Gitcoin voting is, or might be we are so heads down-focused that it‚Äôs just not a priority.</p>
<p>I find it kind of sad.  But curious to see what others think.  There are several low lift solutions to this issue - my question is - does anyone care?</p>

How should I change my delegations? [Q2 2022]
owocki

            <p>I originally started doing these threads before <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/passing-the-torch/10971">passing the torch</a> because I felt like being involved in CSDO/DAO leadership from May 2021 - Summer 2022 it was important to be transparent.    And I wanted to invite a convo about decentralizing delegations.</p>
<p>When I started composing these threads, I had hoped:</p>
<ol>
<li>that other token holders would follow my lead and begin posting their delegations, and that has not happened (with the exception of you once or twice <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle">@kyle</a> ) .</li>
<li>that I would have more engagement in the cause of decentralizing my delegations via submissions to <a href="https://forms.gle/6dkw2P9ybvvepznA6">this form</a> or <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/does-the-dao-need-a-decentralization-essential-intent/11228">an essential intent around decentralization</a>, but that has also not happened (again with a few small exceptions).</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that I‚Äôm (1) not involved in CSDO or DAO leadership as of summer 2022, (2) there was limited engagement on my invitation to help me decentralize my delegations, (3) no decentralization essential intent was ever introduced, and (4) other GTC holders have not followed suit, I was not planning on continuing these threads.   Would it be different this time?   Will I be met half way this time? Open to changing my course of action - especially if my effort is met by efforts of others‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Another path forward might be to have a dune dashboard that just shows how everyone is delegating.</p>

            <p>Frankly I‚Äôm stunned by the low submissions.  It is (maybe) unfortunate but politics is part of dao life.  If folks ignore this our governance efforts may be hindered and biased.  If someone cares about this Dao I implore you to speak up and make some recommendations via the form.  If someone <strong>really</strong> cares about the Dao recommend yourself too though I suggest adding a little proof <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>‚Äú<em><strong>‚Ä¶the tyranny of structurelessness.</strong></em>‚Äù</p>
<p>Wow‚Ä¶any dao-person can appreciate the powerful accuracy of this condition, I bet.  Like a deer frozen in the headlights a dao can be paralyzed by fundamentalists.  There is an alternative future in which we ‚Äòlose the good in pursuit of the perfect‚Äô‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm confident we can avoid this.  A small centralization debt is probably acceptable to me, in the right ways.  (Eg Stewards vote to hire a professional reputable business coach and consider implementing their suggestions).</p>
<p>Really glad to know small delegations may be forthcoming, or, are at least recognized as important. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sunrise_over_mountains.png?v=12" title=":sunrise_over_mountains:" class="emoji" alt=":sunrise_over_mountains:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
