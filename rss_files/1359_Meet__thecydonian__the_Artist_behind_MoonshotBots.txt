    Hey everyone,

You probably saw that last week Moonshot Bots (a PFP for public goods) launched and raised $1.8mm for public goods.  Decrypt covered it here => https://decrypt.co/79606/moonshot-bots-nfts-gitcoin-ethereum-grants-1-8-million


The art for moonshot bots was awesome, and probably a big reason for the success of this project!

This art was created by https://gitcoin.co/thecydonian - a longtime user of Gitcoin, for an April 2020 bounty we ran to create avatars for the [Gitcoin Avatar Builder](https://gitcoin.co/landing/avatar). Here is a link to their submission: https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/issues/6169#issuecomment-611008961

While @thecydonian did license their work to Gitcoin as part of the bounty, I also think that Moonshot Bots would not have been as successful without them, and it is possible that they should be given some sort of variable retroactive reward for their work.

I am surfacing this dilemma to the stewards & community to ask what to do.  Should thecydonian be given some sort of retroactive reward for their work?

Their address, which they have give me permission to give to you all is 0xcC795e91bEECBe22A41834210E9104f15c1D37ac

Best,
Kevin

            <p>Sounds cool! I just have the base versions as I think the quadratic stuff came later, but here are the files I have:</p>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/thecydonian">@theCydonian</a>, we are working on developing 3D versions of the MSBs based on your work. Do you happen to have the original Illustrator files - specifically for the quadratic themed ones - that we could use? That will help us stay as faithful as possible to the original designs.</p>
<p>Here is our full proposal: <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-support-for-creating-3d-moonshotbots/8582" class="inline-onebox">[Proposal] - Support for Creating 3D MoonshotBots</a></p>
<p>You can reach me on Twitter @ metahands or here. (I couldnâ€™t find another way to message you.)</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>For the moment I have only bought, from minting and from the second market and this one was donated half to the gitcoin DAO.</p>
<p>If for some reason I sell 1 of my moonshots, Iâ€™ll donate directly to the artist, even if itâ€™s in a couple of years.</p>

            <p>the same reason as you, it is out of my budget to have one MSB.</p>

            <p>I hope <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/thecydonian">@theCydonian</a> at least has a Moonshot Bot for their work, but given the amount of funding their amazing art is bringing to public goods, they should absolutely receive a reward.</p>
