Statement of Intention / My Values & Reason for Joining: Top approval rating for participation on gitcoin digest, workstreams, hackathon registration and bounty review.
Hopefully we can get more highlights in on the platform, Gitcoinâ€™s grants protocol to run an initial round in time with the gitcoin governance forum as an opportunity for builders to access more resources tools on listings at the gitcoin dao. Good user experience and kudos to the team.
