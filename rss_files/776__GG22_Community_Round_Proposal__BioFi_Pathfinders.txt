## BioFi Pathfinders Round
The Bioregional Finance (BioFi) Pathfinders Round is a partnership between [The BioFi Project](https://www.biofi.earth/), [Open Civics](https://x.com/opencivics), [The Design School for Regenerating Earth](https://design-school-for-regenerating-earth.mn.co/), and [Regen Coordi-Nation](https://x.com/RegenCoordinate) to support the most sophisticated Bioregional Organizing Teams around the world in developing, clarifying, and enhancing their BioFi vision, strategy, and capabilities. The round is aimed at advanced teams that are already practicing or actively developing their approach to Bioregional Finance (BioFi), with a focus on building [Bioregional Financing Facilities (BFFs)](https://www.biofi.earth/what-is-a-bff) or related approaches to bioregional funding ecosystems more broadly. This will serve as a key moment for advancing the practice of BioFi and demonstrating the potential for participatory capital allocation to drive the transition to regenerative, bioregional economies. The team behind this effort believes that BioFi can serve as a powerful lever to decentralize economic power. This round has the potential to better connect the bioregional movement and web3 community to enable the application and development of web3 technologies to serve the bioregional movement.

### Marketing Plan, Community Size & Engagement

We will promote the BioFi Pathfinders Round through a variety of channels to ensure widespread visibility and engagement. Our efforts will focus on leveraging the existing networks of key communities and individuals involved in the round:

* **Community Engagement**: We will activate our networks, including the BioFi Community of Practice (CoP), ReFi DAO, Design School for Regenerating Earth, Open Civics, Regen Ecoweaving, and Ma Earth, to drive interest and participation. Samantha Power will also share the round through her personal LinkedIn account (with 15,000+ followers) and Instagram (2,000+ followers), expanding reach to her engaged audiences. The BioFi Project will also promote the round through its newsletter. Joe Brewer will also share via LinkedIn (12,000) and Twitter (13,000).
* **Support from Key Partners**: We will host a dedicated Twitter space via the Open Civics, Ma Earth, Regen Coordi-Nation Twitter accounts, spotlighting the round and featuring projects selected for participation. ReFi DAO will also promote the round across their channels, including their Twitter (11.1K followers) and newsletter (reaching over 4,000 subscribers). Celo Public Goods (CeloPG) will support the marketing efforts by tapping into their network within the Celo ecosystem. Regen Network will also share across their socials. Their presence on Web3 and ReFi platforms such as Telegram, Discord, and Farcaster will further amplify the campaign. 
* **Enhanced Accessibility**: To increase the ease of participation, we plan to use ViaPrize to accept fiat donations via PayPal. This will allow us to reach and activate a broader audience, particularly those in the BioFi and environmental sectors who may find Web3-based contributions more complex.

### Round History

Further sparked by [tweets of encouragement](https://x.com/owocki/status/1832147081370501447) from Kevin Owocki, the BioFi Pathfinders Round is a new initiative, marking the first time that Bioregional Organizing Teams will come together to receive financial support for advancing their Bioregional Finance (BioFi) strategies. While this is the inaugural round, it is designed with the intent of becoming a recurring event that nurtures the development of bioregional financial systems. BioFi projects from this round will also have the opportunity to join the Regen Coordi-Nation network to participate in their planned upcoming Retro Round, further expanding reach, collaborative potential, and funding to support the development of Bioregional Finance Facilities (BFFs).

### Alignment with Gitcoin‚Äôs Intents

#### Allo GMV

The BioFi Pathfinders Round will ensure strong participation and meet Gitcoin‚Äôs GMV requirements by leveraging the marketing reach and community strength of the many organisations involved in supporting the round. This will provide a robust foundation for attracting significant donations and expand the round‚Äôs visibility across Web3, ReFi, and environmental communities.

To further ensure the accessibility of donations, we aim to utilize ViaPrize to accept fiat donations through PayPal. This will help attract a broader audience, including those new to the Web3 ecosystem, ensuring high engagement and a diverse donor base. We anticipate that this combination of strong networks, comprehensive outreach, and easy donation access will drive a high volume of contributions, meeting or exceeding the 20% crowdfunding requirement relative to any matching provided by Gitcoin.

#### Scaling and Growing the Ethereum Ecosystem

This round will serve to demonstrate Web3‚Äôs capacity to support innovative, place-based financial systems and draw attention to how decentralized finance can be used to support bioregional regeneration. This will not only expand Ethereum‚Äôs use cases but also introduce new donors and actors from traditional finance, philanthropy, and environmental spaces into the ecosystem.

### Match Funding

The matching pool confirmed commitments for the BioFi Pathfinders Round is currently at **$35,000**, which is being secured through a multisig wallet on Celo. The funds have been raised from the following partners:

‚Ä¢ **$5,000** from The BioFi Project

‚Ä¢ **$10,000** from Ma Earth

‚Ä¢ **$10,000** from Celo Public Goods (CeloPG)

‚Ä¢ **$5,000** from Regen Foundation

‚Ä¢ **$5,000** from Design School for Regenerating Earth

The funds are being collected in a multisig SAFE at this address:[ 0x8769d1A0440E1036099c7926acbE7A0869caA056](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=celo:0x8769d1A0440E1036099c7926acbE7A0869caA056)

We are actively seeking additional matching funds from other partners, with discussions underway to further increase the pool e.g. [Kevin Owocki](https://x.com/owocki/status/1835080873961791839). We have a clear plan in motion for future fundraising, with ongoing efforts to bring in further support from aligned partners within the regenerative finance, environmental, and Web3 spaces.

In addition to GG22, **CeloPG** has pledged an extra **$15,000** to be allocated towards the **Regen Coordi-Nation Retro Round** and opened this up for participants of the BioFi Pathfinders Round. This future round will leverage EasyRPGF, built on the Allo protocol.

We would also like to utilise **~ 5-10% of the raised matching pool** to support the operations of the round, ensuring smooth execution, marketing efforts, and high-impact outcomes for all stakeholders.

### Funding Mechanisms

The BioFi Pathfinders Round will primarily leverage **Quadratic Funding** as the core funding mechanism. This approach ensures that smaller individual contributions are amplified, allowing community-driven projects to receive more funding based on broad support rather than just large individual donations. This is critical for ensuring a participatory and decentralized allocation of resources across bioregional projects. Furthermore, to enhance sybil protection and reduce the potential impact of coordinated clusters, we will also implement **Passport‚Äôs Model Based Detection** and leverage **Connection-Oriented Cluster Matching (COCM)**. These additional layers will help prevent gaming of the system by ensuring that funding flows are not overly influenced by sybil attacks or tight-knit groups, thus maintaining fairness and transparency throughout the round.

However, we are also mindful that Quadratic Funding, Passport and COCM, in their current configurations, may favour those with greater Web3 technical literacy and privilege. We recognize this challenge and are actively exploring and seeking to implement additional mechanisms and adjustments to ensure that bioregional regeneration initiatives‚Äîespecially those from marginalized and less Web3-savvy communities‚Äîhave equitable access to funding. This includes creating more inclusive participation pathways and possibly adjusting the matching parameters to better serve a diverse range of contributors and grantees.

### Type of Projects to Fund

We aim to fund **10-20 projects** that demonstrate a strong and coherent bioregional identity, whether through a network of individuals, organizations, or as a keystone organization within their bioregion. Eligible projects will be committed to enhancing their Bioregional Finance (BioFi) systems and capacities, with a clear vision toward developing or refining a Bioregional Finance Facility (BFF).

The projects we are looking to support must show:

* A deep commitment to place-based regeneration, grounded in their bioregion‚Äôs ecological, cultural, and community-based realities.
* A coherent and mature identity as a Bioregional Organizing Team ‚Äì whether that‚Äôs as a network of individuals/orgs, or as one ‚Äúbackbone‚Äù or ‚Äúkeystone‚Äù org with allies, and are working towards the development of a BFF in a participatory and inclusive manner with their community (actively involving local stakeholders, Indigenous peoples, and marginalized communities).
* A readiness and commitment to sharing their journey and learning experiences with the broader bioregional and regenerative finance communities, fostering cross-pollination of ideas and best practices.
* Clear strategies for deploying or experimenting with bioregional financial capital, whether through investing in regeneration projects, organizing community assemblies, supporting legal or governance infrastructure, or developing storytelling and pitch materials to attract further investment.

These projects will be diverse in approach but united in their commitment to bioregional regeneration.

### Impact Assessment Plan

Our approach to impact assessment for the BioFi Pathfinders Round will focus on both quantitative and qualitative self-assessment, with an emphasis on minimizing potential challenges of Web3-specific requirements for grantees at this stage. We aim to gather deep insights into how the funds distributed through the round are utilized, and what each project learns as they move towards building Bioregional Finance Facilities (BFFs).

We will work closely alongside grantees, using **surveys**, **interviews**, and other participatory **post-round research** to assess the impact. Our primary focus will be on the learning process, examining how effectively grantees are telling their story and progressing towards their vision. Key questions include:

* Are they clearly articulating where they are now and where they want to go?
* Who or what has influenced their vision and values?
* What resources or support do they need to move forward?
* How is their community involved, and what role do investors play?
* What participation and governance structures are in place?
* How would larger sums of money (e.g., $1M or $100M) impact their system or break it?

We will also encourage grantees to create flow diagrams or visualizations that map how the funding from this round is moving through their team or network. This will help track:

* Where funds might have stalled.
* Plans for deploying remaining funds.
* How much has directly impacted regenerative projects, community assemblies, or learning experiences on the ground.

By focusing on this ‚Äúlearning out loud‚Äù approach, we can gather meaningful insights into how the round has helped projects move toward building more sophisticated BioFi systems.

### Regen Coordi-Nation Impact Integration

In addition to the above impact assessments, we will offer grantees the opportunity to voluntarily participate in the Regen Coordi-Nation impact assessment and retro program, leveraging the [Common Approach](https://www.commonapproach.org/) framework. This system is being designed to track impact across cosmo-local networks of autonomous but interconnected local nodes, creating a flexible yet interoperable impact data standard. It is built around five core practices‚Äîdescribing intended change, using indicators, collecting useful information, gauging performance, and communicating results. Grantees who opt into this system will be able to report on their activities, outcomes, and impact in a way that suits their local context, while also contributing to a global, interoperable layer of impact data.

Regen Coordi-Nation is working with partners like Karma GAP to integrate these impact reports into their platform using Ethereum attestations (EAS). Furthermore, the use of Hypercerts is being explored to tokenize specific impact claims. This opens the door to retroactive funding opportunities, as participating projects will be eligible for the upcoming Regen Coordi-Nation Retro Round, which will further reward impactful bioregional projects.

### Shaping Regenerative Futures

The BioFi Pathfinders Round represents a pivotal moment for advancing Bioregional Finance (BioFi) and the development of Bioregional Finance Facilities (BFFs). By connecting the most advanced bioregional teams with innovative Web3 funding mechanisms, this round aims to decentralize economic power and catalyze the transition to regenerative, place-based economies. Through a combination of inclusive funding strategies, collaborative networks, and robust impact assessment & follow up, the BioFi Pathfinders Round will help lay the foundation for a new financial architecture that prioritizes people, planet, and long-term biocultural regeneration.

            <p>This is the first time i have ever given a community round full marks on impact evaluation. I like that you have follow up interviews and surveys to grantees to see where they are stuck with their project, how well they could absorb additional funds, etc. Tokenizing hypercerts for retroactive funding, using karma for attestations - music to my ears!</p>
<p>I did wonder how you would do these intensive activities without a clearly laid out budget for impact evaluation. In the future, i‚Äôd like to know not just your impact evaluation method but also from where the funds for that would come from. Its not cheap after all - in the traditional philanthropy world, 5-10% is kept aside for impact evaluation and i don‚Äôt know how BioFi will fund this part.</p>
<p>I also did like the coming together of many communities and excited to see how it works out in GG22!</p>

<h3><a name="marketing-plan-community-size-engagement-4" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#marketing-plan-community-size-engagement-4"></a>Marketing Plan, Community Size &amp; Engagement</h3>
<p>We will promote the BioFi Pathfinders Round through a variety of channels to ensure widespread visibility and engagement. Our efforts will focus on leveraging the existing networks of key communities and individuals involved in the round:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Community Engagement</strong>: We will activate our networks, including the BioFi Community of Practice (CoP), ReFi DAO, Design School for Regenerating Earth, Open Civics, Regen Ecoweaving, and Ma Earth, to drive interest and participation. Samantha Power will also share the round through her personal LinkedIn account (with 15,000+ followers) and Instagram (2,000+ followers), expanding reach to her engaged audiences. The BioFi Project will also promote the round through its newsletter. Joe Brewer will also share via LinkedIn (12,000) and Twitter (13,000).</li>
<li><strong>Support from Key Partners</strong>: We will host a dedicated Twitter space via the Open Civics, Ma Earth, Regen Coordi-Nation Twitter accounts, spotlighting the round and featuring projects selected for participation. ReFi DAO will also promote the round across their channels, including their Twitter (11.1K followers) and newsletter (reaching over 4,000 subscribers). Celo Public Goods (CeloPG) will support the marketing efforts by tapping into their network within the Celo ecosystem. Regen Network will also share across their socials. Their presence on Web3 and ReFi platforms such as Telegram, Discord, and Farcaster will further amplify the campaign.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Accessibility</strong>: To increase the ease of participation, we plan to use ViaPrize to accept fiat donations via PayPal. This will allow us to reach and activate a broader audience, particularly those in the BioFi and environmental sectors who may find Web3-based contributions more complex.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="round-history-5" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#round-history-5"></a>Round History</h3>
<p>Further sparked by <a href="https://x.com/owocki/status/1832147081370501447" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">tweets of encouragement</a> from Kevin Owocki, the BioFi Pathfinders Round is a new initiative, marking the first time that Bioregional Organizing Teams will come together to receive financial support for advancing their Bioregional Finance (BioFi) strategies. While this is the inaugural round, it is designed with the intent of becoming a recurring event that nurtures the development of bioregional financial systems. BioFi projects from this round will also have the opportunity to join the Regen Coordi-Nation network to participate in their planned upcoming Retro Round, further expanding reach, collaborative potential, and funding to support the development of Bioregional Finance Facilities (BFFs).</p>

<h3><a name="alignment-with-gitcoins-intents-8" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#alignment-with-gitcoins-intents-8"></a>Alignment with Gitcoin‚Äôs Intents</h3>
<h4><a name="allo-gmv-9" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#allo-gmv-9"></a>Allo GMV</h4>
<p>The BioFi Pathfinders Round will ensure strong participation and meet Gitcoin‚Äôs GMV requirements by leveraging the marketing reach and community strength of the many organisations involved in supporting the round. This will provide a robust foundation for attracting significant donations and expand the round‚Äôs visibility across Web3, ReFi, and environmental communities.</p>
<p>To further ensure the accessibility of donations, we aim to utilize ViaPrize to accept fiat donations through PayPal. This will help attract a broader audience, including those new to the Web3 ecosystem, ensuring high engagement and a diverse donor base. We anticipate that this combination of strong networks, comprehensive outreach, and easy donation access will drive a high volume of contributions, meeting or exceeding the 20% crowdfunding requirement relative to any matching provided by Gitcoin.</p>
<h4><a name="scaling-and-growing-the-ethereum-ecosystem-10" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#scaling-and-growing-the-ethereum-ecosystem-10"></a>Scaling and Growing the Ethereum Ecosystem</h4>
<p>This round will serve to demonstrate Web3‚Äôs capacity to support innovative, place-based financial systems and draw attention to how decentralized finance can be used to support bioregional regeneration. This will not only expand Ethereum‚Äôs use cases but also introduce new donors and actors from traditional finance, philanthropy, and environmental spaces into the ecosystem.</p>
<h3><a name="match-funding-11" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#match-funding-11"></a>Match Funding</h3>
<p>The matching pool confirmed commitments for the BioFi Pathfinders Round is currently at <strong>$35,000</strong>, which is being secured through a multisig wallet on Celo. The funds have been raised from the following partners:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ <strong>$5,000</strong> from The BioFi Project</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ <strong>$10,000</strong> from Ma Earth</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ <strong>$10,000</strong> from Celo Public Goods (CeloPG)</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ <strong>$5,000</strong> from Regen Foundation</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ <strong>$5,000</strong> from Design School for Regenerating Earth</p>
<p>The funds are being collected in a multisig SAFE at this address:<a href="https://app.safe.global/home?safe=celo:0x8769d1A0440E1036099c7926acbE7A0869caA056" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"> 0x8769d1A0440E1036099c7926acbE7A0869caA056</a></p>
<p>We are actively seeking additional matching funds from other partners, with discussions underway to further increase the pool e.g. <a href="https://x.com/owocki/status/1835080873961791839" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Kevin Owocki</a>. We have a clear plan in motion for future fundraising, with ongoing efforts to bring in further support from aligned partners within the regenerative finance, environmental, and Web3 spaces.</p>
<p>In addition to GG22, <strong>CeloPG</strong> has pledged an extra <strong>$15,000</strong> to be allocated towards the <strong>Regen Coordi-Nation Retro Round</strong> and opened this up for participants of the BioFi Pathfinders Round. This future round will leverage EasyRPGF, built on the Allo protocol.</p>
<p>We would also like to utilise <strong>~ 5-10% of the raised matching pool</strong> to support the operations of the round, ensuring smooth execution, marketing efforts, and high-impact outcomes for all stakeholders.</p>
<h3><a name="funding-mechanisms-12" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#funding-mechanisms-12"></a>Funding Mechanisms</h3>
<p>The BioFi Pathfinders Round will primarily leverage <strong>Quadratic Funding</strong> as the core funding mechanism. This approach ensures that smaller individual contributions are amplified, allowing community-driven projects to receive more funding based on broad support rather than just large individual donations. This is critical for ensuring a participatory and decentralized allocation of resources across bioregional projects. Furthermore, to enhance sybil protection and reduce the potential impact of coordinated clusters, we will also implement <strong>Passport‚Äôs Model Based Detection</strong> and leverage <strong>Connection-Oriented Cluster Matching (COCM)</strong>. These additional layers will help prevent gaming of the system by ensuring that funding flows are not overly influenced by sybil attacks or tight-knit groups, thus maintaining fairness and transparency throughout the round.</p>
<p>However, we are also mindful that Quadratic Funding, Passport and COCM, in their current configurations, may favour those with greater Web3 technical literacy and privilege. We recognize this challenge and are actively exploring and seeking to implement additional mechanisms and adjustments to ensure that bioregional regeneration initiatives‚Äîespecially those from marginalized and less Web3-savvy communities‚Äîhave equitable access to funding. This includes creating more inclusive participation pathways and possibly adjusting the matching parameters to better serve a diverse range of contributors and grantees.</p>
<h3><a name="type-of-projects-to-fund-13" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#type-of-projects-to-fund-13"></a>Type of Projects to Fund</h3>
<p>We aim to fund <strong>10-20 projects</strong> that demonstrate a strong and coherent bioregional identity, whether through a network of individuals, organizations, or as a keystone organization within their bioregion. Eligible projects will be committed to enhancing their Bioregional Finance (BioFi) systems and capacities, with a clear vision toward developing or refining a Bioregional Finance Facility (BFF).</p>
<p>The projects we are looking to support must show:</p>
<ul>
<li>A deep commitment to place-based regeneration, grounded in their bioregion‚Äôs ecological, cultural, and community-based realities.</li>
<li>A coherent and mature identity as a Bioregional Organizing Team ‚Äì whether that‚Äôs as a network of individuals/orgs, or as one ‚Äúbackbone‚Äù or ‚Äúkeystone‚Äù org with allies, and are working towards the development of a BFF in a participatory and inclusive manner with their community (actively involving local stakeholders, Indigenous peoples, and marginalized communities).</li>
<li>A readiness and commitment to sharing their journey and learning experiences with the broader bioregional and regenerative finance communities, fostering cross-pollination of ideas and best practices.</li>
<li>Clear strategies for deploying or experimenting with bioregional financial capital, whether through investing in regeneration projects, organizing community assemblies, supporting legal or governance infrastructure, or developing storytelling and pitch materials to attract further investment.</li>
</ul>
<p>These projects will be diverse in approach but united in their commitment to bioregional regeneration.</p>
<h3><a name="impact-assessment-plan-14" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#impact-assessment-plan-14"></a>Impact Assessment Plan</h3>
<p>Our approach to impact assessment for the BioFi Pathfinders Round will focus on both quantitative and qualitative self-assessment, with an emphasis on minimizing potential challenges of Web3-specific requirements for grantees at this stage. We aim to gather deep insights into how the funds distributed through the round are utilized, and what each project learns as they move towards building Bioregional Finance Facilities (BFFs).</p>
<p>We will work closely alongside grantees, using <strong>surveys</strong>, <strong>interviews</strong>, and other participatory <strong>post-round research</strong> to assess the impact. Our primary focus will be on the learning process, examining how effectively grantees are telling their story and progressing towards their vision. Key questions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are they clearly articulating where they are now and where they want to go?</li>
<li>Who or what has influenced their vision and values?</li>
<li>What resources or support do they need to move forward?</li>
<li>How is their community involved, and what role do investors play?</li>
<li>What participation and governance structures are in place?</li>
<li>How would larger sums of money (e.g., $1M or $100M) impact their system or break it?</li>
</ul>
<p>We will also encourage grantees to create flow diagrams or visualizations that map how the funding from this round is moving through their team or network. This will help track:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where funds might have stalled.</li>
<li>Plans for deploying remaining funds.</li>
<li>How much has directly impacted regenerative projects, community assemblies, or learning experiences on the ground.</li>
</ul>
<p>By focusing on this ‚Äúlearning out loud‚Äù approach, we can gather meaningful insights into how the round has helped projects move toward building more sophisticated BioFi systems.</p>
<h3><a name="regen-coordi-nation-impact-integration-15" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#regen-coordi-nation-impact-integration-15"></a>Regen Coordi-Nation Impact Integration</h3>
<p>In addition to the above impact assessments, we will offer grantees the opportunity to voluntarily participate in the Regen Coordi-Nation impact assessment and retro program, leveraging the <a href="https://www.commonapproach.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Common Approach</a> framework. This system is being designed to track impact across cosmo-local networks of autonomous but interconnected local nodes, creating a flexible yet interoperable impact data standard. It is built around five core practices‚Äîdescribing intended change, using indicators, collecting useful information, gauging performance, and communicating results. Grantees who opt into this system will be able to report on their activities, outcomes, and impact in a way that suits their local context, while also contributing to a global, interoperable layer of impact data.</p>
<p>Regen Coordi-Nation is working with partners like Karma GAP to integrate these impact reports into their platform using Ethereum attestations (EAS). Furthermore, the use of Hypercerts is being explored to tokenize specific impact claims. This opens the door to retroactive funding opportunities, as participating projects will be eligible for the upcoming Regen Coordi-Nation Retro Round, which will further reward impactful bioregional projects.</p>
<h3><a name="shaping-regenerative-futures-16" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#shaping-regenerative-futures-16"></a>Shaping Regenerative Futures</h3>
<p>The BioFi Pathfinders Round represents a pivotal moment for advancing Bioregional Finance (BioFi) and the development of Bioregional Finance Facilities (BFFs). By connecting the most advanced bioregional teams with innovative Web3 funding mechanisms, this round aims to decentralize economic power and catalyze the transition to regenerative, place-based economies. Through a combination of inclusive funding strategies, collaborative networks, and robust impact assessment &amp; follow up, the BioFi Pathfinders Round will help lay the foundation for a new financial architecture that prioritizes people, planet, and long-term biocultural regeneration.</p>
