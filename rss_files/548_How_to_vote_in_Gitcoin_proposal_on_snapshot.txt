https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-to-vote-in-gitcoin-proposal-on-snapshot/12954
    Guys, I don't understand, why I can't participate in DAO voting on snapshot.
I have GTC in my wallet and staked too  on ETH Mainnet now and before snapshot block (even both stamps collected on gitcoin passport).

No article or info found on what's wrong.

Please share it with me.
