            <p>They already have bar type venues on cryptovoxels. But i think it would be cool to buy the cheapest land/blocks and build them into valuable blocks by attracting like minded cypher punks with cool nos music and gaming shit. Btw decentraland has casinos with djs too!<img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/metal/5.png?v=9" title=":metal:t5:" class="emoji" alt=":metal:t5:"></p>

    One guy started dao records , I first saw it on cryptovoxels, which is a awesome place if you never been I recommendâ€¦â€¦â€¦but yes I wanna make some max headroom mix tapes with analog video mixers and have a live music event in cryptovoxels or decentraland. I think realestate is expensive so might need to get pleaserdao to pull together some funds!
