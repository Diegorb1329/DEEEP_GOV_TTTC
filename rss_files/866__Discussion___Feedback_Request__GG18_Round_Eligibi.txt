[Discussion & Feedback Request] GG18 Round Eligibility
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-feedback-request-gg18-round-eligibility/15942
    **Introduction**
--

GG18 is the next iteration of the Gitcoin Program QF rounds that will run on the new decentralized [Grants Stack](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-gitcoin-grants-stack-allo-protocol-product-overviews-part-1-of-2/12664). The planned dates for this round are **August 15th to 29th** and there will be **4 Core Rounds** each with a distinct matching pool:

* **Climate Solutions**
* **Ethereum Infrastructure**
* **Web3 Community & Education**
* **Web3 Open Source Software**

These are the same core rounds as the Gitcoin Program [Beta Round](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-proposal-ratify-the-results-of-gitcoin-s-beta-round-and-formally-request-the-community-multisig-holders-to-payout-matching-allocations/15166) with the exception of ZK Tech. The ZK Tech round was determined to be a better fit as a Featured Round going forward based on the topic scope, number of grantees, and donor turnout from the Beta Round. 

There will also be a number of externally operated Featured Rounds that run in this same 2-week window; the topics and details of which are still being determined.

The purpose of this post is to outline the general eligibility policy that **ALL grants** must meet in order to qualify for acceptance into any of the 4 core rounds. In addition to the general eligibility, grants must meet the extra criteria for the round they are applying for. The description of each specific round‚Äôs eligibility criteria is listed after the general eligibility policy.

**The PGF team is asking DAO contributors, stewards, and community members to carefully read these eligibility requirements and provide feedback or engage in an open discussion where needed**. The requirements are subject to change but will be locked in before the application window opens.

---
*What's Changed Since the Beta Round?*
---
Before the Beta Round, the PGF team created a [governance forum post](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-feedback-request-gitcoin-program-beta-round-eligibility/13306) concerning eligibility requirements and asked the community to weigh in. After lots of productive discussions, a [follow-up post](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/follow-up-gitcoin-program-beta-round-eligibility/13837) was created outlining a few changes and finalizing the eligibility criteria for the upcoming round. Please check out those posts if you're interested in viewing the discussion that occurred and how the eligibility criteria have evolved over time.

Since the Beta Round, the PGF team has deliberated further on eligibility requirements and taken more of the feedback from the previous governance post into account. As a result, the following changes have been made to the Gitcoin Program General Eligibility Policy:
* **Removal of $500k external funding limit** - This has been a long-standing policy of the Gitcoin Program, but we are no longer going to apply this rule with a broad stroke over all of the Core Rounds. There will still be a general requirement that projects cannot have raised "**significant external funding via venture capital, token launches, or NFT sales**", however, the threshold could vary from round to round, and previous grant money will not be treated the same as these sources of funding. 

Although it's being removed as a general policy requirement, a strict funding limit could remain in a specific round's eligibility criteria in some form, for example, if the program were to add a Core Round focused on very early-stage projects. 

---


**Gitcoin Program General Eligibility Policy**
--

This policy is set and enforced by the PGF workstream of the GitcoinDAO and is ratified by the GitcoinDAO stewards. Projects must meet the following criteria:

* **Verified Github (if applicable) and/or Twitter account**
* A single grantee OR organization **cannot apply to one or more core rounds with more than one grant.**
* **A single grant can only qualify for matching from one Core Round pool during GG18.**
* **Project Update** - If you are a returning grantee, you must provide an update on what work has been accomplished since the last grant round your project received funding from.

Additionally, the following are **not permitted** in Gitcoin-operated rounds:

* **Hateful Content** - No racist, sexist, or otherwise hateful speech, no discrimination
* **Deceiving Users** - Malicious content that could cause harm or unintended consequences to users
* **Falsification** - Any type of hacking to falsify a contribution is prohibited. No encouraging or enabling Sybil attacks or other forms of malicious manipulation of the grants platform or the Gitcoin community
* **Fraud & Impersonation** - Claiming to be a brand or person you are not. The Grant owner must be directly affiliated with the project, the funds must go to the project, and be used for the purposes stated in the Grant‚Äôs details
* **Quid Pro Quo & Bribery** - The Grant may not have any form of quid pro quo that has financial value (a scenario in which a user gets some additional unique benefit/award in return for their donation)
* **Advertising** - Using grants to showcase something you are selling like a token sale or NFT drop
* **Well-capitalized projects** - Not have significant external funding via venture capital, token launches, or NFT sales
* **Grantees cannot be subject to sanctions**, and funding cannot be used in violation of any applicable law, rules, or regulations (for example those addressing sanctions, financing of terrorism, and anti-money-laundering)
* **Grantees can be eliminated from consideration in the round** if they are found to be **encouraging or enabling Sybil attacks or other forms of malicious manipulation** of the grants platform or the Gitcoin community

---

**Web3 Open Source Software Round Eligibility**
--

* The grant must be an open-source project with meaningful Github activity in the prior 3 months that has demonstrated work completed towards the project‚Äôs mission
* Primarily focused on developing on top of or advancing the broader Ethereum and/or Web3 industry

---

**Ethereum Infrastructure Round Eligibility**
--

* The Grant must be in **support of, or directly advancing the Ethereum ecosystem**. This includes areas like:
  * Core client devs (e.g., geth / nethermind; prysm / lighthouse)
  * Tooling providers (e.g., hardhat / ethers.js)
  * Those showcasing the power of critical ecosystem ideas (e.g., dark forest with zero-knowledge proofs)
  * Those doing the hard work of educating developers (e.g., Austin (Buidl Guidl) / Nader (DeveloperDAO))
* The Grant must be open source (if software-related)

---

**Climate Solutions Round Eligibility**
--

* Projects must be at least 3 months old. Newer projects should establish themselves and submit to the next round.
* The Grant must be **primarily focused on climate solutions** (the group may do other work but the grant proposal should be directly related to climate solutions). The proposal should explicitly outline how this project will help reduce GHGs or is an important core infrastructure for web3 climate solutions.
* Grantees who received funding in previous rounds **should report on project progress since GR15 or the Alpha & Beta rounds**. We understand that some projects may have less progress given the timing of Alpha & Beta round disbursements. This will ensure accountability to supporters and also help encourage contributors by showing what you‚Äôve been accomplishing.
* **All returning grantees are expected to update their proposal**, in addition to project updates the proposal should include lessons learned from previous work and how they will use the additional funding from the upcoming round. The updated proposal should indicate how additional funding will help the project meet its goals, and include a rough timeline for the project overall.
* There is a general expectation that projects are within the ‚Äú**realm of viability**‚Äù.
  * Even if a project may be at a very early stage, it still must seem credible to the average person with an understanding of web3 technology and climate solutions.
  * Grantee founders must genuinely intend to build the project, and the project must not broadly be considered an impossibility.

---

**Web3 Community & Education Round Eligibility**
--

* **Projects must be at least 3 months old. Newer projects should establish themselves and submit to the next round.**
* **The project must be focused on improving the Web3 ecosystem through building community and/or creating educational content**.
* Examples of projects which may fit are those that are:
  * Growing new communities
  * Providing educational resources
  * Creating content (youtube tutorials, newsletters, blog posts, podcasts, etc)
  * Protecting users by investigating bad actors
  * DAOs focused on socialization
  * Onboarding new users
  * Working on inclusion/diversity/advocacy

**Note: As this is a newer Core Round category, we‚Äôd love to have the community continue to weigh in and narrow the scope or suggest more objective criteria.*

---
**Conclusion**
--

These eligibility requirements are designed to ensure we capture and provide funding to the highest quality projects in each category. As a reminder, the requirements are not yet set in stone and we are **highly encouraging the community to discuss what makes sense and what could be changed**. Thanks for reading this far and stay tuned for more updates!

<p>Exactly. Thank you for bringing the conversation back to a more productive footing.</p>
<p>This account was purely created with the intention of engaging the Gitcoin community on issues of fairness so we can make the next round even better. Gitcoin benefits when its community is more than just extractive, should not be so concerned about a new account as one that is older with less engagement.</p>
<p>So I look forward to hearing from others if there is sufficient social separation between this subset of projects for it not to be suspect under the rule cited in my first post.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>important for clarification</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Projects should be happy to back up claims with on-chain data where appropriate too and avoid taking an offensive attitude, that only ensures more critical scrutiny. Hopefully this helps with that.</p>

</aside>
<p>Is this what has become the concern of this current conversation <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/panpanpan">@panpanpan</a> ?</p>
<p>I understand the point of view that is taken in retrospect. If the same structure of applications formed from this group in other grant ecosystems such as RPGF on Optimism technically it violates the rules of one application per collective of builders.</p>
<p>For instance if I have two project teams &amp; separate brands for each of them only one application would be submitted. Listing the collective of individuals from each team separately in the application process helps to signal this was a group effort. Rather than crowdfunding in a grey area of collaboration or collusion.</p>
<p>Now there are few questions about how the flow of funding raised for the ecosystem works.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the funding shown onchain redistributed into others grant programs while the round is still live?</li>
</ol>
<p>If so this could have resulted in grant manipulation to gain more of the QF matching pool and creates an unfair advantage for other projects that are ran by small teams or individuals.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Does the collective of projects benefit more than a single clustered entity formation would ?</li>
</ol>
<p>If so the energy that is distributed into multiple organizations all campaigning at the same time could instead be used to laser focus on one overarching mission of the collective creating a much more significant impact.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Does this cross the line of coordination and step into collusive behavior ?</li>
</ol>
<p>If so then we should have much more explicit guidance for the grantees during the application process which ensures that the rules about collusion are clear enough for everyone to understand.</p>
<p>I must agree. It is very difficult for us to decipher each of the projects specific roles in this ecosystem map.</p>
<p>Are these all services that provide similar needs within the climate change category?</p>
<p>How does their branding signify that they are or are not associated with each other?</p>
<p>I know as for Atlantis DAO they have an app that has been developed regarding environmental impact initiatives.</p>
<p>I am not sure what stage the app is currently in so a milestone report dashboard has been developed for a few grant ecosystems to assist with this which includes Gitcoin grants.</p>
<p>I have had the pleasure of Beta testing the grantee accountability app from the KarmaHQ team which should be coming out very shortly in the coming weeks ahead.</p>
<p>A few other questions also arise as to whether this was intentional fund raising for the collective in which a cluster group application would be more fitting.</p>
<p>Umbrella <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/open_umbrella.png?v=12" title=":open_umbrella:" class="emoji" alt=":open_umbrella:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> brands often have multiple entities that all operate under the same roof. It seems that it would have only make sense that one application is submitted for the entire company of individuals who are involved.</p>
<p>We would like the communities feedback on these thoughts <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/thought_balloon.png?v=12" title=":thought_balloon:" class="emoji" alt=":thought_balloon:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">‚Ä¶</p>
<p>As a reminder this is not an accusation or assumption about the information being presented. It is important for clarification on this matter to resolve in a way that helps teach the rest of the community an appropriate methodology to participate with others. As well as more of an understanding for those who wish to join the GTC grants stack in the future.</p>

</aside>
<p><em>Resources</em> is not limited to Funds. You are nit picking my response to portray all the work we do in a misguided way, which definitely makes me question the intention of this anonymous account that was created 3 days ago. As you can see in my initial response I have highlighted that these projects you are scrutinizing all have their <strong>own identities, priorities, and outcomes exclusive from Atlantis</strong>. Their founders are vocal public figures. We have collaborated but that is after coming across each other in the Gitcoin community. Our Twitter account apart from ‚ÄúAI generated images‚Äù also shares a lot about the work we do and behind the scenes. In fact every Gitcoin round we have featured in, we have openly promoted what we do, never behind closed doors. This is because just like You, we wish to see funds going to people who do credible and urgent work.</p>
<p>Atlantis is one of the few in the space that have an end-to-end workflow from climate bounties to reputation and rewards being alpha tested on the ground as we speak with 800+ users. You can check out our app which is in open testing both in android and IOS, link for the playstore is <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co">[here]</a></p>
<p>We are extremely proud of our work on the citizen app. It has been developed to be a useful tool for climate projects to attest to their credible work. So, we share the same enthusiasm as you to see funds going toward impactful initiatives</p>

            <p>Never expressed any doubt that AtlantisDAO is creating thousands of jobs or that you are having a great impact on the communities you operate in. Hopefully you can appreciate that this is not an  ‚Äòattack‚Äô on AtlantisDAO, the Solarpunk Guild or any of these other projects you run or are associated with.</p>

<p>The only updates I was able to find are the article you referenced which was published last year. Glad to hear there is more. It‚Äôs very exciting what you are building with the CitizensApp but I‚Äôve only seen mockups and could not find a GitHub repository for the project.</p>
<p>Saw that all the people that follow you on GitHub and all of the people that you follow have about half a dozen repositories each, all of them empty, most of them created in exactly the same time frame. Hopefully this isn‚Äôt indicative of a propensity to ‚Äògamify‚Äô reputation based systems.</p>
<p>Having a positive impact on the world by utilising blockchain technology is great because it affords projects the means for transparency. Especially where bounties are offered and distributed on chain, it would be very easy to provide addresses using the app.</p>

But each of those projects have their own grants too which may not be clear to those donating.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>A few clarifications are to be made here.<br>
Atlantis has always had just ONE grant application. We engage in collaborative efforts with various entities to pursue specific projects that align with the bigger vision of providing effective climate solutions for resilience &amp; regeneration. This involves joint initiatives or the pooling of resources to achieve shared objectives with respect to the specific collaborative projects.</p>
<p>However, each of the above-mentioned entities maintain their own fundraising efforts as they are also actively working on their core and additional projects beyond their association with Atlantis. We at Atlantis strongly believe collaborations are essential in the pursuit of a regenerative future, and Atlantis embraces this approach to maximise impact. Also, note that the entities that you have mentioned have their own significant public presence on Twitter.</p>

<p>The waters are further muddied by the fact that Varanustra and Hydrospear/ Hydrops (owned by the founders of AtlantisDAO) appear to be beneficiaries of funding for the projects listed on their own website.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>We appreciate your concern here, as it gives us an opportunity to clarify.<br>
The names that you mention are legal entities that either helped set up Atlantis or are the operational/implementation arms of Atlantis. This organizational structure is required for the proper execution of initiatives on-ground in an efficient, scalable and lawful manner. It is important to note that the legal entities that you mentioned, have never initiated separate grant applications.</p>
<p>With regards to Mercy Corp Ventures, Atlantis has received a grant of $100K for a pilot project which involves building a Decentralized Water Network. The grant money is disbursed in four stages based on clearly defined KPIs and Deliverables. We share periodic updates about this pilot project on our social media accounts. For your information, the project is currently 3/4th complete.  You can read more about it <a href="https://medium.com/mercy-corps-social-venture-fund/pilot-launch-building-a-peer-to-peer-network-for-clean-water-access-in-india-296b212cc42" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here.</a></p>
<p>We agree that Donors need to have more insight into the grantees and in fact, one of the main focus areas for Atlantis is to develop dynamic impact certificates which can attest credible work done by projects. This functionality will be tailored for climate action projects and built natively in the Atlantis Citizen App. We are happy to preview our early designs with interested community members."</p>

<p>The signals in the data assume that there is no social centrality among grantees - this does not appear to be the case though. Perhaps this is the source of some confirmation bias here. There is little grey area on the grantee side, the links between the projects are quite clear.</p>
<p>Indeed, looking at the paper you referenced above then it‚Äôs very clear that there is disproportional power accumulation and the goal of applying the solutions outlined have not been met. Plurality has been squelched not grown.</p>

<p>This gray area between cooperation and collusion is an extremely important topic for all distribution mechanisms that utilize quadratic funding. I am going to draw heavily from <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=4311507" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this</a> paper, including the concept of cluster-matching that was implemented in GG18, to counter the spectrum between unintentional over-coordination and deliberate collusion.</p>
<p>The paper argues that ‚Äúthe issues surrounding ‚Äúcollusion‚Äù cannot be addressed simply by outlawing some subjectively- chosen set of ill-intentioned actions. Instead, we should design mechanisms that seek consilience by accounting for a broad spectrum of social connections (not just the ‚Äúbad‚Äù ones)‚Äù.</p>
<p>Accordingly, GG18 matching pool was allocated by <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-ratify-the-results-of-gg18-and-formally-request-the-community-multisig-holders-to-payout-matching-allocations/16553#next-gen-quadratic-funding-5">utilizing</a> cluster-matching QF. The signals evident in the data for biases and excessive coordination led to reductions in the match of the most suspicious projects by up to 70%, redirecting those funds to other projects. The results without and with cluster-matching are <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/133eTg4V0iSsK0Id3iBMV1eHRogeWhJm91H2t0fWL0WE/edit#gid=254815602" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a>.</p>
<p>A quick comparison between rounds shows that the Web3 Community and Climate Round had the most ‚Äúredistribution‚Äù of funds due to cluster-match i.e., these two rounds had the most imbalances arising from pre-existing participant relationships. This highlights a greater need for tying impact with funds received making it open for public evaluation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a cursory look at some of the above projects tells a different story based on the signals in the data, i.e., these projects gained a larger share of the matching pool with cluster-matching QF as a result of having a more distinct set of donors supporting these initiatives in comparison to biases observed with other grantees in Climate Round.</p>

            <p>First of all congratulations on all of the improvements made since last round and the ongoing innovation that continues to take shape around Gitcoin. Passport scoring worked flawlessly and although some legitimate people were unable to obtain a high enough score, it worked.</p>
<p>The climate round is in a unique position in terms of how it can be held accountable compared to other rounds whose impact is clearer from the code that they put out.</p>
<p>Going through the various projects‚Äô web presence there was a lot of AI generated imagery, references to companies that have ceased operations and broken links. It was also striking how many common threads there were tying some of these projects together.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA single grantee OR organization cannot apply to one or more core rounds with more than one grant.‚Äù</p>

<p>SolarPunk is in a class of its own when it comes to imagining a utopian vision - it is hard to discern where the money people are donating is going here. If you donate to AtlantisDAO are you donating to Kula, RegenBuild, SolarPunkNomads and others, looking at their website and prior grant applications you would assume so. But each of those projects have their own grants too which may not be clear to those donating.</p>
<p>The waters are further muddied by the fact that Varanustra and Hydrospear/ Hydrops (owned by the founders of AtlantisDAO) appear to be beneficiaries of funding for the projects listed on their own website.</p>
<p>There is a halo effect when projects associate under the same ‚Äòbrand‚Äô - it is a great way to vouch for eachother but should they really all have their own grant each soaking up matching? Donors have a reasonable expectation that dd has been done to ensure that the Gitcoin structure ensures fairness for all those participating.</p>
<p>It would be a great shame to see others suffer delays in the disbursement of funds because of this. Should it be deemed that the above mentioned organisations represent a corruption of the Gitcoin funding mechanism and participated with their own grants, these disbursements should be frozen while the rest are allowed to proceed.</p>
<p>Looking through the different grants application pages it is great to hear that AtlantisDAO in particular is having a great impact in the communities that it serves, creating more than 1000 jobs.</p>

            <p>I think it is something could be explored inside the Guild. Guild could serve as coordination and legitimate this as this is aligned with Solarpunk values.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt know the full listed of rejected grantees in GG18, but could be a great idea to allow low performers to apply into this special round too.</p>
<p>This could turn out to be extremely valuable for new grantees, as we can embed educational content into the onboarding of this special round.</p>

            <p>We were wondering <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/thought_balloon.png?v=12" title=":thought_balloon:" class="emoji" alt=":thought_balloon:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> something similar‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I had a hard time with the application process because sharing the code for our platform creates unwanted vulnerabilities prior to launching our MVP.</p>
<p>Luckily we are also heavily focused on community &amp; education as well so we made it into the core round.</p>
<p>One <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/point_up.png?v=12" title=":point_up:" class="emoji" alt=":point_up:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> thing you mentioned in the above <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/arrow_up.png?v=12" title=":arrow_up:" class="emoji" alt=":arrow_up:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> comments is whether a project plans to go open source if it has not done so due to incentives post Beta release.</p>
<p>There is no way to tell whether what someone is building in the current moment or says they are going to build in the future. That is uncertain &amp; cannot be the premise of which defines a piece of open source technology.</p>
<p>Just as in the world of public goods these metrics are measured with data collected from the past which has already been proven to make an impact.</p>
<p>Otherwise we get into a discussion of what comes first the chicken or the egg.</p>
<p>Ultimately it is fair to say that yes a project needs to be open source to qualify.</p>
<p>A category for Public Goods infrastructure would be lovely to see get funding in the future for those who are contributing to the greater good of the ecosystem.</p>

            <p>Hello <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/wave.png?v=12" title=":wave:" class="emoji" alt=":wave:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">‚Ä¶<br>
Happy to add my two cents here from GG18.</p>
<p>Overall the user experience was an improvement on the grantees side of things.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The UI improved vastly on the platform resulting in a better user experience for donors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gas <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/fuelpump.png?v=12" title=":fuelpump:" class="emoji" alt=":fuelpump:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> fees were optimal of course when using a L2 for transactions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On the other hand there are also a few things to improve on from this round.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Grant application approval process needs more transparency focused on a scoring rubric that is available after the preliminary approval has been completed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grant council member roles are not available of who reviewed each grant during intake.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It would be great to know who is responsible for each grant request as well as having the ability to rotate council members to different categories each round to prevent biased decision making.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Gitcoin passport needs an overhaul.</li>
</ol>
<p>We suggest using a security company like <a href="https://www.getshield.xyz/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GetShield</a> who we have partnered with to detect any suspicious activity onchain or other malicious behavior.</p>
<p>Eliminate scams from your platform</p>
<p>Direct API integration for your web3-native content filter. We continuously and proactively alert malicious scam content and users on your platform.</p>
<p>Monitor your user base for malicious or irregular transaction history</p>
<p>This library detects wallets that have interacted with sanctioned protocols such as Tornado Cash. We also scan for ‚Äúburner wallets‚Äù used to obfuscate illegitimate transfers and a growing range of indicators for malicious actors.</p>
<p>We appreciate all of the development efforts that the Gitcoin team has made since the BETA round. I have no doubts that the experience will improve throughout the year of 2023 and beyond.</p>
<p>Have a great week!</p>

</aside>
<p>I was thinking about something similar‚Ä¶ The most successful projects in QF have aced the shilling / marketing / community (SMC) game. On the other hand, there are many great projects that are not so succesful with at SMC but doing loads of impact on the ground.</p>
<p>I think it would be fun / fair / beneficial for every project to redistribute some % of their raised funds:</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> 10% towards great projects (no additional qualifier)<br>
<strong>B.</strong> 10% towards great projects that were not successful in matching</p>
<p>Thinking about operational complexity - shouldn‚Äôt be that difficult. I‚Äôm more concerned whether this idea makes sense. Current formula with QF is leaning towards ‚Äúwinners take all‚Äù (luckily there is some cap). Winners are integral parts of the community and they know which projects are <strong>A.</strong> great and which projects are <strong>B.</strong> great and didn‚Äôt not ace the SMC game.</p>

            <p>Wow <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/wasabi">@wasabi</a> , I‚Äôm really in love with this idea. There‚Äôs definitely ways for the community to get more involved in raising and supporting projects that don‚Äôt perform so well due to lack of marketing. Many of the Beta round projects committed to donating part of their funding to the bundles, one project even committed 25%.</p>
<p>I would definitely love to see more of this in the ecosystem. Do you think this is something the Solarpunk Guild would like to explore.</p>

            <p>Hi Mars. Thanks for being active in the forum despite being rejected from this round. I can address a few points from your application that led to three reviewers rejecting.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Q: <strong>How do you measure your impact?</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A: This is meta. We are dogfooding. Our project evaluates impact through self-assessment (because it is scalable). Our objectives are now towards onboarding new partners and growing community. Biz dev. Outreach. Out initial milestone is to get initial 10 organisations to use BaseX.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This doesn‚Äôt show impact in relation to climate solutions. The <a href="https://beta.basex.com/evaluations" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">evaluations section of your website</a> shows eight evaluations, half of which are almost blank and three evaluations with comments like ‚Äúmeh meh meh‚Äù; ‚Äúapple is okay‚Äù; and ‚Äúexpensive products, still using the old Lighting cable‚Äù. All of these evaluations seem to have been rushed within the same week and unclear who is evaluating and the criteria for evaluations used.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/basexHQ" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">BaseX</a> twitter has tweeted 12 times in 2013, mostly retweets of other organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Realm of Feasibility:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>BaseX like SpaceX is making life multiplanetary, starting from the earth. We are essential part of tooling to align the incentives towards survival (and thriving) of humanity.</li>
</ul>
<p>We were unable to correlate this based on the <a href="https://github.com/basexhq" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">organization github</a> you provided on your application. It appears very inactive for most of the year.</p>
<p>I also watched your demo vide a few times. It became evident that it‚Äôs still in concept stage. Also evident here: <strong>‚ÄúOut initial milestone is to get initial 10 organisations to use BaseX.‚Äù</strong> You can try reaching our to other grantees to create collabs, having them adopt your platform so you ca apply for GG19 in November.</p>
<p>Your passion for this project is admirable. Please consider using the next few months to show more work, build more community, update on your progress. You might also consider applying for another round like Open Source Software.</p>

            <p>Hi there! Thanks for being critical about our work and the link to the grant round. I‚Äôm Arno, the COO at River Cleanup and I also wrote the grant application. I‚Äôve been working in the environmental field for many years now and there is no doubt that plastic pollution and the climate crisis are linked.</p>
<p>The relationship is multifaceted. Plastic production is resource-intensive and emits a significant amount of greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming. Furthermore, as plastics break down, they can release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Cleaning up plastic, especially preventing it from entering the environment in the first place, can help mitigate some of these impacts.</p>
<p>Here are some credible research studies and reports that shed light on the connection between plastic pollution and the climate crisis:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúThe Hidden Costs of a Plastic Planet‚Äù by the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL): This report provides an exhaustive examination of the lifecycle emissions of plastics, from production to disposal, and its climate implications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúPlastic &amp; Climate: The Hidden Costs of a Plastic Planet‚Äù also by CIEL: This more in-depth report delves further into how the entire lifecycle of plastic exacerbates the climate crisis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúFuture scenarios of global plastic waste generation and disposal‚Äù published in Palgrave Communications: This study discusses how continued plastic production at current rates can lead to increased environmental issues, including exacerbation of the climate crisis due to its lifecycle emissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúProduction, use, and fate of all plastics ever made‚Äù published in Science Advances: This research provides insights into the accumulative generation of plastic waste and its implications, including how it contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúEvidence that the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is rapidly accumulating plastic‚Äù published in Nature: This research doesn‚Äôt focus solely on climate, but it showcases the alarming rate of plastic accumulation in marine environments. The indirect implications for the climate are related to the breakdown of these plastics and the potential greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reports by the World Economic Forum: They have multiple reports on plastics and the environment, some of which touch upon the impact on climate change due to the energy-intensive nature of plastic production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúBreaking the Plastic Wave: A Comprehensive Assessment of Pathways Towards Stopping Ocean Plastic Pollution‚Äù: This report by the Pew Charitable Trusts and SYSTEMIQ details the growth trajectory of plastic pollution in oceans and some of the potential climate-related implications. This report is also the foundation of the Ripple Model, the Theory of Change of River Cleanup. I highly recommend reading the summary of this publication.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It‚Äôs essential to be aware that while cleaning up plastic from the environment can have numerous benefits, the most significant climate benefits come from reducing plastic production, consumption, and waste. A holistic approach to addressing both the plastic pollution crisis and the climate crisis would involve transitioning to a circular economy, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels (which are the primary raw material for many plastics), and implementing sustainable waste management practices. All these activities are in the scope of our operations.</p>
<p>With regards to the link of River Cleanup and Web3. As I mentioned in the Twitter space on Tuesday, we have not yet integrated any Web3 solutions into our operations. But that‚Äôs exactly what I want to use this grant money for. We don‚Äôt have the expertise in our team to work on this integration, and the funds can help us with hiring someone who can help us with that. The applications are numerous: Token incentives, supply chain transparency, DAOs, crowdfunding, data collection‚Ä¶ You name it. I really hope River Cleanup can make some steps in the Web3 direction in the upcoming years!</p>
<p>I hope my explanation will help you understand our application for this round. If you have any more questions, feel free to reach out to me <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>I like the idea of onboarding Web2 into Web3, I like the idea of Web2.5 and using payment cards / PayPal / Wenmo as a stamp in the passport and I like the work of River Cleanup. I just prefer rules to be clear, less ambigous and applied fairly across the board.</p>
