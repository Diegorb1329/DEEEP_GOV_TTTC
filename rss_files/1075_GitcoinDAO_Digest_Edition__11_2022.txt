* In [Grants 2.0 is how we scale our impact üìà](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/grants-2-0-is-how-we-scale-our-impact/10015), [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary) shares his thoughts on the future of grants: ‚ÄúTLDR: Grants 1.0 is centralized & therefore has an upper limit to its growth. [...] We can reduce fragility & scale our impact with Grants 2.0 I explore what that world looks like & attempt to build common understanding & consensus about that direction.‚Äù

* In [How do we scale our sensemaking?](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-do-we-scale-our-sensemaking/10192), [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary) shares the idea that ‚ÄúSensemaking is the process by which people give meaning to their collective experiences‚Äù and asks ‚ÄúWhat novel sensemaking tools/processes, or sensemaking tools/processes for DAOs, should GitcoinDAO be aware of?‚Äù

* [A world where QF Enhances *Every* Income](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-world-where-qf-enhances-every-income/10202) by [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary) describes an ambition of GitcoinDAO to have "[QF enhance every income](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/why-i-am-holon-maximalist/10152)‚Äù and how ‚ÄúGrants 2.0 could allow us to exponentially scale Grants because we're not the ones administering the QF rounds anymore.‚Äù

* [The Blue Ocean](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-blue-ocean/9868) by [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary) is about how we explore The Internet of Jobs (an uncontested market space or blue ocean) and continue building products that can make Web3 go mainstream.

* In [Abundance & Scarcity ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/abundance-scarcity/10045/5) by[ Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary), [Kyle](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kyle/summary) replies to share his thoughts on how GitcoinDAO scales through having aspects of being an ImpactDAO (funding public goods), ProtocolDAO (Coordination Party Kit, Grants 2.0), and InvestmentDAO (grant funding leads to early project discovery). Kyle also describes how Gitcoin continues to diversify it‚Äôs treasury and that workstream leads ‚Äúare doing double duty, running the DAO and their Workstreams‚Äù

He emphasizes the importance of knowing that Peacetime and Wartime have different values and makes a ‚Äúchallenge [to] the DAO stewards & leaders to be aware of whether they are in wartime or peacetime.‚Äù

* Grants round 13 is in the books! We raised $4.6M for public goods, with $3.2M from matching funds and $1.4M from the community! üéâ

* Round 13 grantees can expect payouts to be ready to claim on April 15th!

### [üöÄ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-prototyping-workstream-moonshot-budget-request-q4-2021/8785) [Moonshot Collective](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Moonshot-Collective-ffa78f44a0de412cb607f9b69d3a376f)

They highlight how ‚Äú[w]e are seeing a huge shift of talent coming into Web3 + more of that talent being part time then full time. So the question becomes how do we onboard the continued influx of new talent & part time contributors to full time and meaningful work. ‚Äú
