Without further ado, let‚Äôs dive in!

## [:robot: Meta-Governance](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/governance-meta/6)

* [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki) [announced](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1460648659146608647?s=20) [Schelling Point](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1460648659146608647?s=20) in Denver Colorado the day before ETH Denver on February 17th. The event is a one-day celebration of mechanism design, coordination tech, public goods, culture and regen finance. Join the conversation in the [Telegram chat](https://t.me/joinchat/EX2vtzI0earU2LER).

* [Transcending the Individualism & Collectivist Divide](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1458541350211575808?s=20) by [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki) makes the case that ‚Äúthere is a large opportunity to create alignment between these Individualist/Collectivist communities with web3 (and thereby move past the differences with views on public goods funding).‚ÄùIndividualists/Collectivists do not agree how to organize society. These disagreements were amplified by the nation-state era. We can bridge this divide with web3.

* [Laurence](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/lanlan3322) started a thread titled [dGrant solution](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-dgrant-solution/9023) to discuss the challenges and possible solution to improve the Decentralized Grants Verification. The thread introduces the role of a ‚ÄúWatcher‚Äù that can flag suspicious submissions and send them to the ‚ÄúGitcoin Grant Court‚Äù to challenge.

* [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki) authored a thread titled [Where does the Gitcoin Grants Matching Pool Money Come From?](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/where-does-the-gitcoin-grants-matching-pool-money-come-from/9036) To give more insight and recognition to the projects and individuals that help fund the Matching pool for Grant Rounds. ‚ÄúAs of Nov 2021, the[ Grants Multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xde21f729137c5af1b01d73af1dc21effa2b8a0d6) has roughly $15mm of tokens in it. At $1m/round and 1round/quarter, that is 15 rounds of Gitcoin Grants forward funded (for 3.5 years).‚Äù A big thank you to all the fantastic funders of Gitcoin Grants!

* The [GitcoinDAO Notion](http://gitcoindao.com) is undergoing a major revamp by [QZ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/fishbiscuit/) and [Vishnu](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/vgk) to make the experience more streamlined and easier to navigate. Right now there‚Äôs not a whole lot to see just yet, but we will be rolling out the new design during the next few days.

* Lately you might also have noticed a lot moving around in the [GitcoinDAO Discord](https://discord.gg/gitcoin): some channels popped up, others disappeared, and this is all part of a bigger plan to help people find their way around more easily. [Kris](http://twitter.com/krrisis) and [Alp](https://twitter.com/alpergintr) have been focusing on this over the past couple of weeks, more updates coming soon!

## [üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Workstream Discussion](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/workstream-discussion/9)

### üå± [Public Goods Funding](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-public-goods-funding/129)

* [Annika](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/annika) has been ramping up as a grants-ops lead. She published a proposal for [Gitcoin GR12 Matching Pool Allocations](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gitcoin-gr12-matching-pool-allocations/9007) to ‚Äúdiscuss and finalize how funding allocations for the Gitcoin Grants Round 12 Matching Pool are distributed and how to use categories (if at all). After previous successful Grants Rounds, this proposal aims to continue community-owned decision making.‚Äù

* The [Ethereum Foundation](https://twitter.com/AyaMiyagotchi/status/1460621197935198209) announced their allocation of $500k to help fund crypto policy advocacy; other thematic rounds continue to make progress in the background.

* The first Public Goods Twitter Space was hosted on Monday by [Alisha](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/alisha) and [Lani](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/lanitrock/summary), the event aims to help push the mission of public goods to a broader audience, [QZ made a summary.](https://twitter.com/f_shbiscuit/status/1460682988899868673?s=20)

* The first official librarian meeting was held to discuss the future of library onboarding and content curation.

* As we get closer to being able to execute small test token swaps, we have also begun to seed and fund a number of other partnerships with orgs including [DeveloperDAO](https://twitter.com/developer_dao), [Verses](https://twitter.com/notscottmoore/status/1457885830333308928), and [DreamDAO](https://twitter.com/garysheng).

### [üöÄ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-prototyping-workstream-moonshot-budget-request-q4-2021/8785) [Moonshot Collective](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-public-goods-prototyping/130)

* [The GreatestLARP](https://greatestlarp.com/) is going strong as 118 of 200 Molochs needed to open Level 4 (The Final Boss) have been minted. We have settled on a [‚Äúwomp womp‚Äù policy for Level 3](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-governance-question-for-greatestlarp-com/8848/29), which adjusts the bonding curve in case minting slows. So far The Greatest LARP has raised over $338,000 for public goods. That‚Äôs a green-pilling!

  [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki) published a [new poll](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-governance-question-for-greatestlarp-com/8848/33) on the go-live policy for level 4 ([The Final Boss)](https://zora.co/collections/zora/5725), which is about a week away at current pace.

* Last Friday we dogfooded several Moonshot projects including Recruiter.Party, Tip.Party, and Tokenstream.Party. Get caught up on what they‚Äôre all about on our [YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVupIN3GgLtjNtEMPz32MQdQfX_wNYujL).

* Moonshot Collective is the prototyping workstream of GitcoinDAO, do you want to help tell its story? We need writers, video producers, designers, and more. Come say hello in the Discord.

### üåê [Decentralize Gitcoin](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-decentralize-gitcoin/180)

* The Decentralized Gitcoin Workstream budget for Q4 has been [executed on chain](https://www.withtally.com/governance/gitcoin/proposal/9).

* Currently the grant approval/denial process is very unclear in the interface to the end user. We are working on adding some clarity to the UI and process around this. My Grants and My Contributions pages are also being worked on.

* The Data/DevOps substream has made movement on getting the sybil resistance machine learning pipeline running and is currently waiting for BlockScience to complete updates required to make it possible to run in a new environment

* We are actively interviewing product and project management candidates for our workstream to help with both dGrants and our other projects

### üíô [Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)](https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/Fraud-Detection-Defense-f1a2969a9f324f57a02ef69a60b25cae)

* The Sybil Detection pipeline gained a devops person to run the operational processes and algorithm developed by Blockscience while also beginning work on a community data lake. Combined with the anonymized data model for the open source feature engineering pipeline will create a wide range of community participation which wasn‚Äôt possible before.

* Sybil Detection stream is looking to make a proposal to receive funding from ENS. They are also looking to contribute funding to BrightID, Proof of Humanity, and Idena to share datasets making more features available for detecting sybil accounts in a flywheel of reinforcement between identity and reputation.

* The research stream passed its first proposal and will also be sending 5 Ph.D. researchers to participate in Token Engineering‚Äôs Governauts DAO Comp Policy study. They will study the mechanisms used by other DAOs and the effects they create.

* The user support stream will be moving to the DAOops stream. This includes the knowledge base maintenance and the translation squads. FDD will send the remainder of their Q4 budget when they are set up with a governance structure or by request of the DAOops stream.

- FDD Weekly Flags:
  * Yellow Flag: Aligned on next steps for legal. Gray area on contributor agreements in the meantime
  * Green Flag: CrossStream DAOops governance made a plan for How we make decisions!
  * Red Flag: Steward compensation could change options for entity type & tax requirements
  * Yellow Flag: Need some parameters for judging squad/stream health
  * Yellow Flag: How might we track insights from RAID models that don‚Äôt pay directly to contributors?

### üé® [Merch, Memes & Marketing](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-suggestion-mmm-merch-memes-marketing-for-public-goods-gitcoin-gitcoindao/7066)

* The development substream of MMM is currently building out the Meme Museum. The purpose of the site is to provide an archive of web3 related memes for the broader community to reuse and to celebrate Memelords and artists.

* A first version of the workstream‚Äôs website is currently being developed. The site will act as the team‚Äôs portfolio and create a more intuitive first point of contact for new contributors.

* The ‚ÄúMMMü§ùMC comms‚Äù-raid has been passed and funded. [Matt](https://twitter.com/matthewcarano) leads the raid and is actively seeking new content creators, writers and video editors for the mission. Reach out on Discord if you would like to contribute!

* The [@GitcoinDAO](https://twitter.com/gitcoindao) Twitter account has been transformed into Gitcoin vibes. The account will interact with the community in a more fun and informal manner. The @ Gitcoin Twitter-handle will continue to be used as a way to announce events, initiatives and news. We are looking for contributors to manage @ GitcoinDAO, reach out if you‚Äôre interested!

* We‚Äôve seen some great submissions to our [GR12-Schwag-bounty](https://gitcoin.co/issue/gitcoinco/creative/412/100026987) which will end next week. We look forward to onboard more talented designers and collaborate on the ETHDenver-swag pack and upcoming merch-drop!

<p>Currently the grant approval/denial process is very unclear in the interface to the end user. We are working on adding some clarity to the UI and process around this. My Grants and My Contributions pages are also being worked on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Data/DevOps substream has made movement on getting the sybil resistance machine learning pipeline running and is currently waiting for BlockScience to complete updates required to make it possible to run in a new environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are actively interviewing product and project management candidates for our workstream to help with both dGrants and our other projects</p>

<p>The Sybil Detection pipeline gained a devops person to run the operational processes and algorithm developed by Blockscience while also beginning work on a community data lake. Combined with the anonymized data model for the open source feature engineering pipeline will create a wide range of community participation which wasn‚Äôt possible before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sybil Detection stream is looking to make a proposal to receive funding from ENS. They are also looking to contribute funding to BrightID, Proof of Humanity, and Idena to share datasets making more features available for detecting sybil accounts in a flywheel of reinforcement between identity and reputation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The research stream passed its first proposal and will also be sending 5 Ph.D. researchers to participate in Token Engineering‚Äôs Governauts DAO Comp Policy study. They will study the mechanisms used by other DAOs and the effects they create.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user support stream will be moving to the DAOops stream. This includes the knowledge base maintenance and the translation squads. FDD will send the remainder of their Q4 budget when they are set up with a governance structure or by request of the DAOops stream.</p>
</li>
