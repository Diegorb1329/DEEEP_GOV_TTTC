https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gcp-xxx-yollow-xyz-making-public-goods-funding-fun-and-accessible/19721
    ## Summary

This GCP proposes to fund the development of YOLLOW.XYZ, an innovative mobile-first alternative frontend interface for the Allo protocol that reimagines public goods funding through a simple, engaging swipe-able interface. 

By reducing friction in the donation process and making funding more accessible, YOLLOW aims to increase participation in grant rounds and demonstrate Allo's potential as flexible infrastructure.

For this initiative, we are requesting $55,000 USDC (for Phase-I) distributed over 4 months for design/development, infrastructure, and launch costs.

## Abstract

YOLLOW.XYZ transforms public goods funding from a complex transaction into an engaging discovery and donation experience. The platform introduces two core innovations:

1. **Single-Gesture Funding**: Transform multi-step donations into intuitive gestures (inspired by premier match-making Apps):
    - Swipe right to donate $1
    - Super-like to donate $5
    - Swipe left to pass
2. **Story-Driven Discovery**: Present projects through visually engaging cards that emphasize impact and learn from user interactions to create personalized discovery.

Additionally we're targeting broad spectrum of platforms that can benefit from same codebase:

1. Farcaster Frames-V2 (farcaster/warpcast) [Phase I]
2. Mobile Web [Phase I]
3. Native (ios + android) [Phase II]

We're planning to launch (Mobile Web + Farcaster) alongside next quaterly gitcoin round [Phase I].


## Motivation

Allo Protocol needs alternative frontends that unlock its potential in new ways. YOLLOW brings consumer-grade UX innovations—specifically proven card-based interactions(used in matchmaking)—to public goods funding, making donations frictionless for web3 natives while creating an intuitive experience for users that come on-chain for first time.

            <p>This is the third proposal in recent weeks requesting funds to build something new for Gitcoin and/or Allo. For context, here are my responses on the other two recent ones: <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/citizen-grants-gcp-impact-passports-and-impact-quadratic-funding-impactqf/19712/5">Impact Passports and Impact QF</a> and <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gcp-xxx-community-knowledge-base-for-llm/19523/6">Community Knowledge Base for LLM</a>.</p>
<p>tl;dr - I like the ideas and the teams, but I don’t like the principle of funding external teams to build prototypes that haven’t undergone any initial user testing. I feel these proposals would be 10X more compelling if they had a working prototype or at least some wireframes. Call me crazy, but this should be a requirement for funding any team proposing something that hasn’t shipped yet.</p>
<p>Given this is NOT how we currently do things, let me respond to the substance of the request.</p>
<p>I agree with the problem statements identified by the YOLLOW team, namely, that Gitcoin should be experimenting with new donation interfaces. I also appreciate the push to ship something before ETH Denver. Having skimmed the thread, I can also see that there’s been a lot of feedback that the team has responded to wrt to budget and ROI from other stewards. I won’t be a blocker, and am willing to vote in support of this proposal provided it maintains the support of Gitcoin’s product leadership.</p>

            <p>Love it!!</p>
<p>At this point, something like this is probably the only way we can get people to actually sift through so many grant programs and support more projects rather than just the ones they are already familiar with.</p>
<p>To those concerned about where will this be used, I‘d suggest integrating this as the official mobile UI for donating on Gitcoin. It could be A/B tested or users could be given choice between “Gitcoin Classic” &amp; the swiping UX - then asked about which they enjoyed more.</p>
<p>It would also be a great way to encourage people to do a bit of donating whenever. No longer have to go through the whole process of scrolling, curating &amp; making a cart. Instead, just open the app, do a few swipes for 5 min while drinking coffee in the morning <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/person_shrugging.png?v=12" title=":person_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":person_shrugging:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p>Chiming in here with my perspectives on this.  As a power user of our tools I could see where enabling mobile first experiences could help in various ways.</p>
<p>Given RaidGuild’s strong track record and my experience working with them, I’m inclined to support this team - they don’t take on projects without believing in their potential impact. However, while their proposal shows promise for improving mobile conversion, the $25k ask is steep against projected $5k donation volume.  Additionally, the timeline is only for three months.</p>
<p>Given our goals this year revolve around driving increased volumes through our platforms I would suggest that we consider a longer term roadmap from the team showing how they intend to scale the platform usage over 6-12 months.  Based on those estimates maybe we could look at an initial investment to get started and more incentivization via retrofunding over time if there is traction.</p>

<p>Love the idea of alternative grants interfaces.</p>

</aside>
<p>who is the target market for this?  how will we get it in their hands?</p>
<p>to me mobile confers that its for embodied cap allo.  how do the constraints differ here?  i think an event (embodied experience) wiould be the right place to bring this to market.</p>
<p>gitcoin is runing schelling point ( <a href="https://schellingpoint.gitcoin.co">https://schellingpoint.gitcoin.co</a> ) on 2/27 in denver.  what would have to be true to scope this down in time/cost and deliver value for schelling point? (as defined by a committte of SP organizers)  i would personally put $5k into the projects matching pool if i had confidence it would be ready for SP and would add value to the event experience</p>
<p>to know this path, i think wed have to do discoveery with the orgs of schelling point (or similar event) to see what kind of embodied cap allo they want to do. hackathons is def one use case.  there might be paritcipator budgeting experments we could do too.  eg vote for which speaker/charity/booth you think is most impactful</p>

<p>The <strong>$5k</strong> figure is just one way to measure quantitative returns, and of course, it may vary depending on adoption and usage. However, the core aim of this project is much broader: to renew interest in public goods funding for everyone, make the experience enjoyable, and reduce friction so donating feels like an opportunity rather than a task.</p>
<p>This project also serves as a first-of-its-kind experiment for <strong>Gitcoin’s Allo protocol</strong>, paving the way for decentralized, community-built frontends. If successful, it could inspire more developers to build innovative interfaces for Allo, creating a stronger and more diverse ecosystem.</p>
<p>To test and refine the product, we plan to use key events leading up to the next Grants Round, such as <strong>Oasis-On-Chain</strong> and <strong>ETH Denver</strong>, to gather real-world insights. With <strong>Gitcoin’s</strong> support, particularly through marketing and social channels, we’re confident in maximizing its reach and impact.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Budget Flexibility and Community Support</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>While we’d be thrilled to work on this at any level, the proposed budget reflects the resources needed to deliver a polished build. This would allow us to work full-time, stay laser-focused over the next few months, and ensure the final product is something both the Gitcoin team and the community can be proud of.</p>
<p>That said, we deeply value <strong>Gitcoin’s</strong> community-driven development ethos. This tool is designed to be adaptable for a variety of use cases—for example, we could see the <strong>Greenpill</strong> network hosting monthly swipe sessions or even <strong>Gitcoin</strong> internally using it to surface innovative ideas through donation as a signaling mechanism.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Swipe Experience and UX Concerns</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Your concern about swipe fatigue is very valid. To mitigate this, we’ve envisioned features to strike the right balance between helping users fund and discover projects:<br>
• <strong>Filtering Options</strong>: Users could filter by community rounds or project types, similar to setting preferences in traditional swipe apps.<br>
• <strong>Budget-Aware Design</strong>: Many donors may come in with a set budget (e.g., <strong>$10–$15</strong>). After they exhaust it, they can decide to continue swiping purely to discover exciting projects or leave the app at their convenience.<br>
• <strong>Dual Emphasis</strong>: The goal is to make funding and discovery equally seamless, ensuring donors feel they’ve contributed meaningfully while also exploring innovative ideas.</p>
<p>We’ve also tested this idea informally with several members of the <strong>Gitcoin</strong> and adjacent ecosystems, and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. We’re committed to building this in close collaboration with the community to ensure it meets their needs while delivering a fun and impactful experience.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>Once again, thank you for the thoughtful critique and ideas. We love the suggestion of a phased approach (e.g., a <strong>$20k</strong> MVP) and would happily explore how we can incorporate this to demonstrate the concept effectively while keeping development community-driven.</p>
<p>We’re so grateful for your support and feedback—it’s invaluable as we shape this project into something meaningful for <strong>Gitcoin</strong> and the broader public goods ecosystem. Let us know how we can continue refining the proposal to align with <strong>Gitcoin’s</strong> vision!</p>

            <p>This is a cool proposal – I love the idea of mobile-first innovation!</p>
<p>I’m a little stuck on the investment ($55k) vs return ($5k in donations). What would have to be true to make the return much larger than the investment – how could we increase donations or make the investment smaller? I’d be thrilled to support a $20k build that we redirect mobile users to for the next QF GG round, see how it goes (even without cool animations!) and determine the next funding steps from there.</p>
<p>Additionally from a UX perspective… we’ve thought about a swipeable interface and worried about the fatigue that might present given the number (100s) of projects in a grants round. In “traditional”/Tinder-like swiping interfaces, it doesn’t matter if the user gets bored and abandons swiping – they’ve completed the actions they came there for. However, if a user gets bored and leaves the grants experience, we miss the opportunity to actually collect their donation! Wonder how we might mitigate this or if you’ve done any testing to disprove the concern?</p>

            <p>Love the idea of alternative grants interfaces. Perhaps it can represent good-spirited competition for who can most effectively match donors &amp; worthy projects. Really valuable work, hope to support the team on advising Allo integation.</p>

            <p>Definitely like the approach here and can see the mobile first approach being much more user-friendly for lots of types of people who want to donate to many projects but don’t want to have to manually search through the applicants in each round.</p>

            <h2><a name="summary-1" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#summary-1"></a>Summary</h2>
<p>This GCP proposes to fund the development of YOLLOW.XYZ, an innovative mobile-first alternative frontend interface for the Allo protocol that reimagines public goods funding through a simple, engaging swipe-able interface.</p>
<p>By reducing friction in the donation process and making funding more accessible, YOLLOW aims to increase participation in grant rounds and demonstrate Allo’s potential as flexible infrastructure.</p>
<p>For this initiative, we are requesting $55,000 USDC (for Phase-I) distributed over 4 months for design/development, infrastructure, and launch costs.</p>
<h2><a name="abstract-2" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#abstract-2"></a>Abstract</h2>
<p>YOLLOW.XYZ transforms public goods funding from a complex transaction into an engaging discovery and donation experience. The platform introduces two core innovations:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Single-Gesture Funding</strong>: Transform multi-step donations into intuitive gestures (inspired by premier match-making Apps):
<ul>
<li>Swipe right to donate $1</li>
<li>Super-like to donate $5</li>
<li>Swipe left to pass</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Story-Driven Discovery</strong>: Present projects through visually engaging cards that emphasize impact and learn from user interactions to create personalized discovery.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally we’re targeting broad spectrum of platforms that can benefit from same codebase:</p>
<ol>
<li>Farcaster Frames-V2 (farcaster/warpcast) [Phase I]</li>
<li>Mobile Web [Phase I]</li>
<li>Native (ios + android) [Phase II]</li>
</ol>
<p>We’re planning to launch (Mobile Web + Farcaster) alongside next quaterly gitcoin round [Phase I].</p>
<h2><a name="motivation-3" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#motivation-3"></a>Motivation</h2>
