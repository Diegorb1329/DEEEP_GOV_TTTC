    # Gitcoin Grant Application

- **Project Name:** Salaries Science
- **Team Name:** World Science DAO
- **Payment Address:** 0x36A0356d43EE4168ED24EFA1CAe3198708667ac0

I propose to allocate funds for development of "Gitcoin killer" app.

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Gitcoin killer: Gitcoin-like project for both science and software. Special features to support basic science and software components to be priority-financed.

I propose a grants system similar to Gitcoin, but with the following features:
- allocating a part of donation to dependencies
- mandatory affiliate program, to ensure that no scientific discovery goes unmarketed (it is especially important, because a scientific project can be published, so preventing publication or re-discoveries, but go unmarketed, this way blocking development of science)
- rewarding first-comer affiliates, in order not only to start small but encompass broad adoption

The project is planned to be implemented on DFINITY Internet Computer, thanks to its super-low gas fees. Dependencies for software (like `crates.io`) and for science (Semantic Scholar) are projected to be managed by third-party servers in a decentralized way.

This project is unrelated to other projects of Radicle, but its purpose is somehow similar to Drip project. However, my project is focused on a different purpose than only rewarding contributions, but intends to save science for mis-publication catastrophe.

Case study: Ordered semicategory actions (OSA) were discovered by me in 2019. Upon reading my work it becomes obvious that most of future science should build upon this discovery. But publication of OSA wasn't successful and I after a sequence of steps came to the situation that I cannot publish my discovery neither in full (500 pages), nor by parts. So, the entire science development is stalled, until OSA will be published. I see no way to publish OSA through traditional publishers, so we need this project to support scientific marketing: I shown that even one scientific discovery without funds for publication may severely block the entire science. Apparently, other similar cases may exists, so we see that science is in deep crisis.

The radical solution of this problem is to replace the entire system of peer review by quadratic funding.

So, this project is intended for:
- provide good "salaries" to scientists and free software authors (especially for software components and basic science, through allocation of a part of donations to dependencies)
- unstuck science by paid scientific marketing instead of traditional peer review

Importance to unstuck science from mis-publications happened in the centralized world is immense. Even one mis-published scientific project (such as OSA) may push down the entire science and therefore world economy. It is also important to establish an effective way to reward unknown to the world software components authors.

### Team's experience

I have an extensive experience with DFINITY Internet Computer programming: I created the MVP (and advanced the work further) of Zon, an elaborate social network on the same platform DFINITY Internet Computer: https://docs.zoncirlce.com

I also have extensive exprience with TypeScript, the language that I am going to use.

## Project Description :page_facing_up:

[The detailed description of the algorithm.](https://github.com/vporton/salaries-science/blob/main/financing-science-algorithm.odt?raw=true)

I am applying for this grant, because I want to save science from mis-publication (including but not limited to proper marketing of OSA).

## Future Plans

In the short term (after the release), I am going to press-release my project and gain some supporters.

In the long term, I am going to displace Gitcoin and Drip replacing them by my project.

The project will be sustainable because it will gather money, among other projects for itself.

We will need further grants for improving design, SEO, and other marketing.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

Work I have already done:
- written the [algorithm](https://github.com/vporton/salaries-science/blob/main/financing-science-algorithm.odt?raw=true) (in English). I also started to write Motoko code, but it is very preliminary. (I am also going to replace Motoko by TypeScript.)
- created [NacDB](https://github.com/vporton/NacDB), a database useful for this project.

<p>In the short term (after the release), I am going to press-release my project and gain some supporters.</p>
<p>In the long term, I am going to displace Gitcoin and Drip replacing them by my project.</p>
<p>The project will be sustainable because it will gather money, among other projects for itself.</p>
<p>We will need further grants for improving design, SEO, and other marketing.</p>

<li>written the <a href="https://github.com/vporton/salaries-science/blob/main/financing-science-algorithm.odt?raw=true" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">algorithm</a> (in English). I also started to write Motoko code, but it is very preliminary. (I am also going to replace Motoko by TypeScript.)</li>
<li>created <a href="https://github.com/vporton/NacDB" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">NacDB</a>, a database useful for this project.</li>
