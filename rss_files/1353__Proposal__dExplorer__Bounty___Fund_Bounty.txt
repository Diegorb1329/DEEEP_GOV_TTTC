[Proposal] dExplorer (Bounty / Fund Bounty)
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-dexplorer-bounty-fund-bounty/8960
    **Summary**

With the exponential growth of Gitcoin and its transition to a DAO some improvements went unnoticed,
I believe that the explorer and foundation of Bounties is very important for the whole ecosystem so I propose some modifications.


**Resume**

- Today we store the bounties in a centralized database, I propose to store this data in **arweave**,
decentralizing information from both the github base and the gitcoin base.
- Explorer There is no notification, it is necessary to be in discord or keep giving F5 on the page, or be notified by email
of a new bounty or hackathon

Motivation

I'm an explorer, hunter and founder who loves being on gitcoin and I see exponential value in everything we build, I would like to improve this ecosystem.


**Specification**

- I estimate a 8 weeks  job between design construction, react application with all integrations

**dExplorer Roundmap**

**1 and 2 weeks**
- build a new design
- Improve Search Filters
- Improve the Design of Featured Bounts
- built an application in React
- Integration with arweave

**3 and 5 weeks**
- Mobile Application

**6 and 8 week**
- Building a firefox/chrome extension as bounty notifications
- CrossChain Native - Ability to create bountys on any compatible EVM chain


**Budget**

Budget required for construction is GTC 7736 GTC


**Why should this proposal go to vote?**

I am always thinking about improving the things I consume and use, I believe that improving the explorer will improve the relationship between bounty founders and hunters thus increasing the speed in building applications and joining web3 projects

            <p>I thought of literally a mobile application using ReactNative for dExplorer, with the focus on founding bountys and applying to bountys. think of the world of possibilities of a mobile application in many places in the world how people look for a mobile application when accessing a responsive application. I donâ€™t have the data but I believe a large portion of gitcoin is accessed by mobile devices.</p>

            <p>I am not very savvy with budget estimations but the idea sound very good. Maybe this is a dumb question but what is the mobile application for? Notification of new bounties to your cell phone or something?</p>
