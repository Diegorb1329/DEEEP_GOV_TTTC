https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-dao-week-in-governance-edition-8/8357
    This weekly post has the ambition to summarise what‚Äôs been going on in the Gitcoin DAO Governance. Topics, ideas, proposals, and votes will be listed with links for further reading and discussion. If there‚Äôs anything missing please reach out! üìù

### [ü§ñ Meta-Governance](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/governance-meta/6)

* @Pop posted an updated v2 of the [Gitcoin DAO Governance Process](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-dao-governance-process-v2-updated/7860) that clarifies certain terms/sections and includes several of the comments from v1.
* The Llama DAO Members @HelloShreyas, @AcceleratedCapital authored a thread on [Gitcoin Treasury Vision](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-treasury-vision/8254) that ‚Äúaims to outline and ratify a treasury management framework that aligns with Gitcoin‚Äôs values and mission‚Äù.
* @lefterisjp posted a [proposal](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-issue-clr-fund-a-40k-gtc-grant/8240) to Issue CLR.Fund a 40k GTC Grant. @auryn from CLR-fund provided more [details](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-issue-clr-fund-a-40k-gtc-grant/8240/10) on how the funds would be used.

* An [AMA](https://twitter.com/gitcoin/status/1427642185802031123/photo/1) with @owocki on [The Gitcoin/GitcoinDAO Egregore is Emerging](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-gitcoin-gitcoindao-egregore-is-emerging/8200)-post was hosted on Discord as it‚Äôs been generating some discussions.

* The first [Gitcoin stewards unconference chats](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-stewards-unconference-chats/8112) was hosted by @anett on the 18th. The ambition of these calls is to have ‚Äúnon formal chat together, share memes, share whatever we want. The outcome should be to build relationships as the DAO moves faster when people know each other and create a more friendly atmosphere in DAO.‚Äù
* A couple of [bounties](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/dgov/?org=gitcoinco) in the currently [running](https://youtu.be/sJe2sx3atUg) [Decentralized Governance Hackathon](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/dgov?) from Gitcoin and GitcoinDAO workstreams are up for grabs by the attending hackers.
* The five [RFPs on decentralizing parts of Gitcoin](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/workstream-discussion/progressive-decentralization-technical/12) authored by @owocki continue to draw attention with an increasing number of applicants.
