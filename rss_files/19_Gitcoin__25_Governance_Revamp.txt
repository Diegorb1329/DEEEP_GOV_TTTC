    # Gitcoin '25 Governance Revamp

Thank you to @sov for being an integral part of outlining this proposal and continuing to be a huge thought partner on the evolution across all areas of making Gitcoin succeed.

## Historical Context & Current State

Gitcoin's governance journey mirrors that of many pioneering DAOs. It began with community members and evolved through various experiments in decentralized decision-making. The current "steward" model emerged organically from the early days of Gitcoin Grants, reflecting the community's initial needs but showing signs of strain as the ecosystem has grown and matured.

New stewards were often selected through informal forum posts, with selection criteria based more on community recognition than defined qualifications. While this organic approach helped build our early community, it has led to scaling and maintaining consistent governance participation challenges.

The current model faces several key limitations:

* Informal Selection Process: Community members typically self-nominate through forum posts, and there are no standardized evaluation criteria or regular renewal process. This informality has resulted in an inconsistent governance body, with some members being highly active while others have drifted away.
* Unclear Responsibilities: Stewards need help understanding their role in the ecosystem, clear expectations or formal onboarding. The lack of accountability mechanisms means that participation varies widely, with some stewards actively driving decisions while others remain passive observers.
* Missing Incentives: Stewards volunteer their time without compensation. Justifying deep involvement can be challenging, especially for those with professional governance expertise who could add significant value to Gitcoin's ecosystem.
* Structural Complexity: The overlap between governance bodies ‚Äì stewards, community council, and other groups ‚Äì has created confusion about decision-making authority and responsibilities.

## Proposal Overview

This proposal represents a shift in how Gitcoin approaches governance. Rather than attempting to patch the current system, we propose rebuilding our governance structure from first principles - emphasizing professional capability, clear accountability, and strategic ecosystem building.

## Key Changes from the Current Model

The transition from our current steward model to a professional delegate system represents three fundamental shifts in our approach to governance.

1. Moving from informal to professional governance. Instead of relying on volunteer stewards with unclear responsibilities, we'll establish a compensated group of professional delegates with explicit duties and qualifications. This shift acknowledges that effective governance requires dedicated time and expertise.
2. Implementing term limits and regular reviews. Delegates will serve defined terms with quarterly self- reported performance evaluations. This change ensures the regular renewal of governance perspectives while maintaining accountability for active participation.

Expanding the scope of governance responsibilities. Rather than limiting governance to proposal review and voting, delegates will actively drive ecosystem growth through partnership development and strategic initiatives. 2025 Governance Goals & Overview

In 2025, Gitcoin DAO‚Äôs governance mission is to build a governance framework that fosters progressive decentralization, incentivizes participation, and aligns decisions with the DAO‚Äôs long-term vision.

**Key Goals for 2025:**

* Update and ratify the DAO Constitution to solidify core principles and provide clear decision-making guidance.
* Decentralize governance with 50% of proposals initiated by the community.
* Launch and onboard an additional 10+ high-caliber stewards through a structured training program with clear compensation and parameters.
* Publish governance updates and metrics
* Collaborate with 3+ DAOs on governance experiments.

[Read the full strategy.](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoins-governance-strategy-for-2025/19845)

## Governance Structure

The heart of our governance system will be a five-member Delegate Council, selected from three key constituencies, each serving one-year terms with semi-annual reviews conducted by the DAO Lead:

* Professional DAO Delegates: Experienced governors from major DAOs who bring deep expertise in decentralized governance and can help forge strategic partnerships. These delegates should have a proven track record of active participation in at least one major DAO's governance over the past year.
* Community Leaders: Representatives from values-aligned communities who understand public goods and can help bridge different ecosystem participants. These leaders should demonstrate successful community-building experience and alignment with Gitcoin's mission.
* Ecosystem Contributors: Established participants with proven track records in both governance and public goods who understand Gitcoin's mission and potential. These contributors should show evidence of meaningful contributions to the public goods ecosystem.

Semi-annual reviews evaluate delegate performance against key metrics, including proposal participation, partnership development, and community engagement and deliverable execution. The community or any member of Gitcoin may recommend removing and replacing underperforming delegates, subject to vote.

### Selection Process

The delegate selection process prioritizes transparency and community input while maintaining high professional standards:

* Nomination Phase (2 weeks)
  * Self-nominations via standardized form template
  * Detailed applications covering governance experience, vision, and partnership plans
  * Clear articulation of intended contributions and time commitment
* Election Phase (1 week)
  * Community vote using GTC tokens
  * Top 5 candidates selected
  * Minimum voting threshold to ensure broad participation

### Delegate Responsibilities

Our delegates will carry three primary mandates:

**1. Core Governance**

* Active Participation: Must maintain 90% vote participation rate and provide written rationale for major decisions. Regular attendance at delegate coordination calls is required.
* Governance Innovation: Share insights and suggestions for governance improvements, with a goal of contributing meaningful enhancements to our processes and documentation each quarter.
* Budget Oversight: Review and approve community round budgets, providing detailed allocation rationales to ensure transparent fund management.
* Strategic Planning: Facilitate quarterly governance reviews and help shape Gitcoin‚Äôs long-term vision through regular strategic input and ecosystem analysis.
* Updates to the items outlined in [Gitcoin‚Äôs 2025 Gov strategy ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoins-governance-strategy-for-2025/19845)

**2. Lead the GG Community Rounds Decision-making**

* We have moved to a more decentralized future for Gitcoin Grants where we have begun to involve the community directly in vital decision-making when it comes to the community rounds that Gitcoin funds each quarter during GG rounds. The council‚Äôs responsibilities include:
  * Review and vote on GG community round proposals
  * Collaborate on GG community round retrospectives (optional)

The council will elect a ‚Äòlead‚Äô that will act as representative and report directly to the DAO with updates on a monthly basis.

**Time Commitment:**

* Core governance activities: at most 1-2 hours/week
* Community rounds review: 2 hours/week during GG rounds
* Partnership development: flexible, outcomes focused

Total: ~3 hours/week average

### Compensation and Incentives

To attract and retain high-quality delegates, we're implementing a professional compensation structure:

* Direct Compensation: $2,500 per quarter per delegate, paid in GTC
* Voting Power: ~1M GTC delegated from the treasury to ensure meaningful influence across the 5 delegates
* Performance Reviews: Quarterly evaluations based on participation and impact - as self-reflected in the community (i.e., they need to post their quarterly engagement report)
* Total Budget: $50,000 annually (within the DAO budget)

## Implementation Timeline

*The first 6 months will be a trial period*

### Q1 2025

* Launch framework and documentation
* Run initial delegate election
* Distribute GTC delegations
* Begin council operations

### Q2 2025

* Establish first partnerships
* Conduct the first quarterly review

*We will run a full evaluation after Q2 to asssess the effectiveness of the program as well as the value add. If deemed a success, we will continue for the remainder of the year.*

### Q3-Q4 2025

* Evaluate and refine the program
* Expand partnership initiatives
* Adjust based on learnings

## Expected Outcomes

Through this governance evolution, we expect to achieve several key outcomes:

* Professional Governance: A more accountable structure with consistent, high-quality participation from dedicated delegates with the time and resources to contribute meaningfully.
* Stronger Ecosystem Position: Enhanced relationships with other DAOs and communities through strategic partnerships and active collaboration, driving the adoption of Allo Protocol and Grants Lab.
* Scalable System: A governance framework that can grow with Gitcoin while maintaining our commitment to decentralization and community ownership.

            <p>One update I would like to highlight is that after some reflection and feedback, we have lightened the scope of work for the delegates, removing the ‚Äúecosystem growth‚Äù piece, ensuring that the expectations outlined for the delegates and compensation may balance out more.</p>

            <p>It‚Äôs always nice to see governance at Gitcoin progressively being decentralized and having community engagement! To add ontop of this, I would also suggest a <em>delegates training program</em> being open to the commmunity like the Round managers training so the quality of delegates is always high and members from within the community being empowered.</p>

            <p>Thanks for tagging me.  I am down to make the term on this a trial of six months to test the waters.</p>
<p>I hear all the thoughts and concerns here from others.  For me (and I may be biased in this view), I would like to see from the council a generative aspect that drives towards our North Star distribution goals through our tools, and I believe that aligning compensation to this is needed (and the direction many other DAOs are going).</p>
<p>For that, I think we would need individuals and teams with relationships/clout across the wider Ethereum Ecosystem to help us move the needle in this respect versus what we have seen to this point.</p>

            <p>Appreciate your thoughts here <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/ccerv1">@ccerv1</a> and as an active steward here for a while I value your judgement. Those contributor paths pipeline is something that I have been wanting to implement in another area within the community for a while (or a version thereof), as I think it‚Äôs a very valuable. When it comes to baking that into a governance strategy, I think that‚Äôs a way‚Äôs away though and could be a really good longterm goal as we continue to push forward our gov goals of 2025.</p>
<p>I wasn‚Äôt around when stewards were first onboarded. Part of the problem IMO with consistency over the years that I have been here is that there has been many handovers of processes and a lot of turnover so perhaps that‚Äôs where things have gotten lost and a lot of stop-starts. That being said, though, one of the top feedbacks that we have received is that stewards should be compensated/incentivized better and I did see a lot of decline in activity/engagement since I started. This is part of what we aim to solve for this year: <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoins-governance-strategy-for-2025/19845">Gitcoin Governance Strategy 2025</a>. And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm confident that this will be different and that it may be a strong stepping to a stronger incentive structure such as contributor paths.</p>
<p>The one change we could make is elect the council for 6 months instead of a year and at the end of that term we re-evaluate the value. That way we‚Äôre also keeping ourselves accountable. I would love to also hear <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/sov">@Sov</a>‚Äôs thoughts here!</p>
<p>From the perspective of the GG Council and their responsibilities (which this new council structure would also be responsible for), is that those members expressed interest to become more engaged within the Gitcoin ecosystem on a broader level as it helps with context setting when making decisions about Community Rounds within GG, so I would personally be excited to see a council be more engaged in a few different areas beyond only the gov forum.</p>
<p>We‚Äôll take this to a vote next so that we can get it finalized.</p>

            <p>Good points re: missionaries/mercenaries, and I do feel like there are some important distinctions to consider re: incentives, which you bring up.</p>
<p>For example, I think this kind of paid delegation arrangement could make sense in situations where ‚Äúarms-length‚Äù counsel is useful, and I agree with you that ecosystem stewards should be more driven by passion than compensation. I say that because, as we all know, ecosystems in need of stewardship will need that stewardship in situations where compensation isn‚Äôt always available, or at least not at market rates for the work entailed by said stewardship.</p>
<p>So thats something for folks here to consider. Does it make sense to have arms-length delegates, who are compensated for their attention and contributions to governance matters? Or would folks rather governance be handled more intimately/vocationally by stewards?</p>
<p>I think there are valid benefits/risks either way, e.g. arms-length paid professional delegates can offer a fresher perspective, and if they don‚Äôt have active internal projects at Gitcoin they may be better positioned (i.e. less biased) to assess prospects and triage resources. On the other hand, reserving prominent delegation roles for stewards would arguably ensure greater established context re: proposal review (i.e. stewards are already familiar with Gitcoin affairs).</p>
<p>I definitely agree non-steward delegates shouldn‚Äôt be ex officio stewards, but it may be useful to have non-steward delegates provide perspective from an arms-length distance from Gitcoin ops, especially since these folks would be from the wider Gitcoin community anyway.</p>

            <p>As one of the top external delegates for the past year or so, I am inclined to vote NO on this proposal.</p>
<p>tl;dr -</p>
<p>Stewards should be missionaries; I worry this proposal may attract the mercenaries.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs my thinking‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Do I want to see delegates take their job seriously? Yes.<br>
Do I think delegates should have more skin in the game? Yes.<br>
Do I want delegates to be accountable to making smart, principled, independent decisions? Yes.<br>
Do I think delegates should put in the necessary time to actually add value? Yes.<br>
Do I think there‚Äôs an opportunity cost to that time, especially for serious people? Yes.</p>
<p>All ‚Äúyes‚Äù‚Ä¶</p>
<p>However, I am worried that paying delegates will attract first and foremost people who want compensation, as opposed to what‚Äôs best for Gitcoin / GTC. The important question to me is how to attract the right people to get involved in stewarding. If compensation is a big blocker to this, we should resolve it and offer compensation. But I‚Äôm not convinced it is‚Ä¶</p>
<p>When I first joined as a steward, there was a larger group of external stewards who received some monthly compensation. Most if not all were airdrop recipients with significant GTC holdings. There was also some automated reporting using DAOStewards ‚Ä¶ it felt much more professional. <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/mathildadv">@MathildaDV</a> describes this above.</p>
<p>But over time, those stewards moved on and the pool became shallower. Why will this be different?</p>
<p>Coincidentally, I came across this excellent post which <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/deltajuliet">@deltajuliet</a> shared in a different group chat:</p>

            <p>There are two main perspectives to consider in this scenario:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The DAO‚Äôs Perspective</strong>: The DAO wants to maximize value for its budget.</li>
<li><strong>The Business‚Äôs Perspective</strong>: The business wants to optimize its return on investment (ROI).</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù where both parties can agree on what constitutes fair compensation, with the key variable being the hourly rate. This rate will also influence the caliber of talent available for the project, as more experienced individuals typically demand higher pay.</p>
<p>If the volume of work is expected to be low, it may be helpful to establish clear expectations around the hourly rate, possibly by referencing past examples. Additionally, gathering feedback from the kind of stewards the DAO is targeting can help determine whether the proposed rate is justified based on the expected performance.</p>

<p>This metric is susceptible to gamification, regardless of how it‚Äôs incentivized. A bonus structure, with oversight from the core team, offers a balanced approach. It creates an incentive for quality proposals while allowing the core team to evaluate and decide which ones meet the necessary standards.</p>
<p>On the flip side, asking contributors to submit ‚Äòx‚Äô proposals per quarter could lead to unnecessary or low-quality submissions. Quality proposals require context and expertise, often taking several days to develop, whereas simpler proposals may only take a moment to draft. If the goal is to prioritize quality over quantity, it may be worthwhile to offer higher pay for higher-quality contributions, even if they are fewer in number.</p>

            <p>Thanks for this <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/wasabi">@wasabi</a> - I think we‚Äôre down to figure out ways to incentivize this better. We had initially budgeted the council out of the DAO and can turn this into a proper proposal from the treasury with community alignment, so this is healthy discourse.</p>
<p>In regards to a few points:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Quite a few demand much more than this proposal in much more active forums. Historically we‚Äôve jumped into governance improvements as an ‚Äòall or nothing‚Äô approach and it hasn‚Äôt moved the needle much. As you can see in our <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoins-governance-strategy-for-2025/19845">Gov 2025 Strategy</a> we‚Äôre starting from first principles and improvements AND a holistic approach to make governance approachable and <em>useful</em> for the community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôd recommend providing a bonus for ‚Äúproposing 1-2 system improvements‚Äù instead of includeding it in the mandatory KPIs and bumping up the quarterly comp to atleast match what the rest of the ecosystem offers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you elaborate here? I hardly think making a useful suggestion is worth a bonus, and in fact should be a key trait of council member we‚Äôre looking for (something like <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a> 's comment above).</p>
<p>Compensation realistically can‚Äôt match what the ecosystem offers, nor should it as this a) isn‚Äôt an apples to apples comparison and b) doesn‚Äôt have consideration for treasury size. I think the community would be open to something more realistic.</p>
<p>Last point(s) I‚Äôll make are that while the Stablelabs deck is informative it isn‚Äôt a useful artifact in this conversation because what it doesn‚Äôt outline is the pros/cons of each program or the activity. Most of the programs I looked at had 40-50+ active topics a month. We simply don‚Äôt have that volume.</p>
<p>I also want to say that this isn‚Äôt a critique, I think your notes are highly valuable. It‚Äôs prudent for us to develop this program and our governance in a mindful and intentional way in order for it to be successful, enjoyable and useful for both Gitcoin and its community members.</p>

            <p>This is great info and I agree that we could adjust to have additional compensation based on performance.  I would prefer that if we do that performance would equal new partnerships/driving up distributions towards our north star goal of $30M versus good ideas.</p>
<p>On the report you shared (or others you know of) has there been analysis in the volume of discussions/proposals that delegates must review?  In looking at those named in the analysis many of these seem to be much more active than the Gitcoin forum so I am curious how volume could play into the level of effort.</p>
<p>Thanks as always!</p>

            <p>Thanks for this <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/jengajojo">@jengajojo</a>.</p>
<p>I do agree that incentives need to be aligned and proportional to the ask and the caliber of those participating.</p>
<p>Based on my experience with Gitcoin as an active participant the volume of information is quite low compared to other DAOs so I do think we should consider that in proportion to the incentives.</p>
<p>With that being said, do you have suggestions on what might need to change or evolve to better align?</p>
<p>Thanks as always for your thoughtful perspectives!</p>

            <p>Excited to see many key points of improvement suggested in this post. I‚Äôd like to flag that the amount of work that is expected from these high caliber stewards is significant. While I completely agree with the KPIs which are outlined here, I fear that the incentive offered may not be sufficient. Several other DAOs offer significantly higher incentives and demand lower output from their top delegates. Given the fact that experienced governance talent is limited in the space, higher or equivalent incentives are necessary to keep this talent motivated to achieve the goals stated in this proposal.</p>

            <p>Agree with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/clinamenic">@Clinamenic</a> here. I think this is a great approach and I‚Äôd be honored to be considered as well. We‚Äôve been going down the path of progressive decentralization/protocolization ourselves with <span class="mention">@OpenCivics</span>, so I understand the challenges of designing and deploying a process that is both transparent and inclusive while also ensuring timely and strategic decisions.</p>
<p>I would take the role of delegate seriously and bring deep listening to the needs and perspectives of DAO members while being highly transparent and strategic in my thinking. Excited to see where this goes! Either way, I‚Äôm a fan of this strategy.</p>

            <p>I really like the idea of paid, professional delegation arrangements, with clear expectations and scope, and I‚Äôd be honored to be considered. Happy to share more info as needed, and I already have a dedicated delegation EOA at <a href="https://snapshot.box/#/profile/0xaB8d45da88B4c3117b238b1126bD144C383E7129" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">delegate.clinamenic.eth</a>.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve also tossed some ideas around with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/trigs">@Trigs</a> about best practices for professional delegates, e.g. what principles or goals generally undergird one‚Äôs participation in various governance scenarios. Anyway, as an aside, thats something I‚Äôm interested in exploring as well.</p>
<p>Reading Don Quixote now, and perhaps we could use a code for delegates-errant!</p>

            <p>As a former contributor to the first ever Community Council that handled proposals coming to Community Rounds for matching, i fully support this approach.</p>
<p>It will address many shortcomings outlined in the previous Retrospectives and empower Contributors to take action to help fix them on the fly using their allocated $GTC to voice concern where it matters the most ‚Äúgov forum and proposals voting‚Äù</p>
<p>i gotta say the entire 2025 strategy being rolled across the ecosystem is very aligned with the needs of the community and the builder-first approach is a key component for unified growth.</p>
<p>Delegates will have the agency, urgency, and resources to take action where‚Äôs most required at any given time.</p>
