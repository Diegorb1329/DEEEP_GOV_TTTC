**Workstream Mandate:** Defend Gitcoin (Grants, DAO, & future products) from threats to its legitimacy, credible neutrality, and sustainability.

# Season 14 Budget Proposal

This is a renewal proposal for the Fraud Detection & Defense workstream requesting budgetary funds for Season 14 (1 May 2022 through 31 July 2022).

**FDD is requesting $486,130 to fund Season 14 (S14) and replenish its reserves for S15.**

## High Level Budget Breakdown

Season 14 Budget Total = **$649,455**

PLUS Season 15 Reserves = $432,970

Total Needed = $1,082,425

MINUS Current Reserves = $596,295

($690k total holdings | $596k Season 13 reserves & $94k treasury)

Total Amount requested at this time = **$486,130***

**The GTC total will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Snapshot and to Tally. The vote will be to send $ in GTC at the current price when moved to Tally or the 20 day moving average (whichever is lower).*

## TLDR

**FDD is responsible for the following items which are mapped to the outcome sets below**

* Defending Gitcoin Grants from exploits. (Sybil Accounts, Collusion, etc)
* Coordinating the grant eligibility policy & reviews
* Sustainably operating the workstream. Goal setting, delivery, accountability, & comms.

# Season 14 Goals

[FDD Season 14 Goal Planning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sWPEYJSY6P5exNxaiUtCaFrcX2bNPAmOJZt-6veGoko/edit?usp=sharing)

FDD has **Top Level Goals** which seasonally examine its respective **medium term focus** tagged **Essential Intent**. Consequently, (round over round) **RoR Health Metrics** are deployed to determine progress toward the **medium term** (12-18 months) **goals**.

**Objectives & Key Results (OKRs)** are used to guide each top level goal set **within a season**.

**Outcomes** are derived from our retro & strategy workshops, discussed with CSDO leadership, then **assigned to an Outcome Owner** through a process of nomination, synthesis, and ratification. Outcome owners are allowed to participate on the **FDD Source Council**. This **gives them voice** through the **progressively decentralized FDD decision-making process**. The corresponding Decision Making Agreement can be found in [Notion](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Decision-Making-Agreement-00808e48bee74ad1a2d08d58051111f5).

Most importantly, **Outcome Owners are accountable** for successfully executing on **deliverables during a season** and transparently communicating blockers and impediments preventing or delaying the delivery of **key results**. The **FDD Source Council** is responsible for incubating ideas and implementing passed proposals in the interest of the **continuous improvement and progressive decentralization of FDD** & Gitcoin.

# Essential Intent & RoR Health Metrics

These metrics are how we show the round over round improvements of the FDD workstream.

## Sybil Defenders

***To minimize the effect of sybil attacks on Gitcoin Grants now and in the future***

* Cost/evaluation (S12=$4.39;S13=$1.42)
* Inter-reviewer reliability score (n/a)
* USD removed from fraudulent allocation (S11=$606k;S12=$621k;S13=)
* Number of models (S11=2;S12=2;S13=2)
* Human evaluations (S11=1,800;S12=6,000;S13=12,000)

## Grant Intelligence Agency

***To improve the legitimacy, scalability, and quality of grant eligibility processes***

DisruptionJoe

            <p>Maybe this round isn‚Äôt the time to officially put budget towards it, but if we did the initial discovery this round, it could be great timing. We will keep it an option on the vote.</p>
<p>Here is what we would do if it was voted for:</p>
<h2>
<a name="problem-narrative-1" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#problem-narrative-1"></a>Problem Narrative</h2>
<p>In order for a borderless democracy on the internet to succeed, it will require sybil resistance. Gitcoin Grants has shown us that the machine learning detection models can scale, but it does not provide a sustainable source of funding to build a digital public infrastructure.</p>
<h2>
<a name="solution-2" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#solution-2"></a>Solution</h2>
<p>A model for launching Sybil Detection DAO (SDD) needs to be designed. This begins with standing up supply side microservice subDAOs specialized in incentivizing one behavior. FDD will use funding from Gitcoin and potentially other grants to fund the contributors to build these microservice subDAOs while earning governance in the future Sybil Detection DAO via an issuance curve.</p>
<h2>
<a name="season-14-deliverables-3" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#season-14-deliverables-3"></a>Season 14 Deliverables</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reaching potential data partners and scoping bi-directional interface points
<ul>
<li>Interface point 1: Data flows</li>
<li>Interface point 2: Token/governance flows</li>
<li>PoC Use Case: Bright ID</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sketching and modeling potential SDD token governance and economic systems
<ul>
<li>Include how microservice subDAOs would be embedded in the scheme</li>
<li>Include budget estimates for operational costs for 1 year</li>
<li>Mapping of microservice protocols to launch prior to SDD with roadmap</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Description of a technical roadmap for making SDD viable
<ul>
<li>How incentive mining might perform in SDD microservice subDAOs</li>
<li>System engineering graphic identifying inputs and outputs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Research and recommendations for legal ‚Äúcontainer‚Äù</li>
<li>Research and describe integration points between SAD, SDD, and dPoPP</li>
</ul>

<p>IMO this is going to require less data science/ML focused, more devrel, marketing, mechanism design, fraud detection + remediation + governance management.  would be interested to build a strategy around it.</p>

            <p>I think maybe in the medium term it could be‚Ä¶</p>
<p>We have a need in serving Gitcoin‚Äôs use case first (and driving adoption that way). As mentioned previously, I see this as a crawl ‚Üí walk ‚Üí run approach. lets solve our need, using the protocol (and developing the protocol) before we turn outward for customers and guidance.</p>
<p>Gitcoin Passport is like a baby bird. We are not ready to throw it out of the nest, but we do see a big blue sky of potential.</p>

<p>The voting will ask voters which option they would fund at the highest level. Then votes will be added from higher levels to the lower levels.</p>
<p>If Option 1 has 1 million votes, and option 2 has one million votes, then option 2 will be considered to have 2 million votes.</p>
<p>Then, if option 3 had one million votes, it would be considered to have 3 million votes, enough to pass quorum, therefore option 3 would win.</p>

            <p>So FDD had some autonomy and realized it could make a bigger impact on GitcoinDAO‚Äôs mission by expanding positive externalities outside of Gitcoin, and this is the misunderstanding.</p>
<p>GitcoinDAO stewards may see FDD going outside it‚Äôs critical mandate as not within it‚Äôs mandate.</p>
<p>While FDD may see it as serving GitcoinDAO‚Äôs mission better.</p>
<p>The way we solve this is to transparently and publicly discuss the situation. Perhaps FDD should lose some autonomy and scope as to not confuse the stewards, but then it should probably also spin out sybil detection DAO to serve Gitcoin‚Äôs mandate if the Stewards agree that it has value and fits within the GitcoinDAO scope.</p>

[Cancelled/Superceded S14 Proposal] FDD Season 14 Budget Request
danlessa

            <p>Hey friends on GitcoinDAO <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/earth_americas.png?v=12" title=":earth_americas:" class="emoji" alt=":earth_americas:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>Sorry for the late comment. I‚Äôll express my contribution which will make the case towards us <strong>exploring what it takes to push for more evolution</strong> and how this passes through <strong>sketching how a Sybil Detection DAO could look like,</strong> as we can and should perform incentive alignment around our ultimate goal of <strong>providing Web3‚Äôs best Sybil Detection as a Service.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Most of the current function as well as some challenges of FDD has been described in the discussion here. FDD performs a <strong>critical function</strong> in GitcoinDAO, as Sybil Resistance and Collusion Resistance are critical for the legitimacy of Grants.</p>
<p>This is done through a series of increasingly sophisticated processes that have been developed by the entire FDD group since before the DAO was created, and required because our ecosystem demands ever increasing technical excellence with no compromises whatsoever on transparency, decentralization and community ownership on the input, process and outcome. It has been a process of pioneering both in how we organize (governance of algorithmic processes - i.e. the machine learning pipeline), and how we detect and defend against sybil attacks and collusion (governance by algorithms, in a DAO).</p>
<p>Going deep and evolving this critical function is not easy nor trivial, and it can be far from sexy when scratching the surface of what it should be. After all, it is about the ongoing <strong>operation and maintenance <strong>of GitcoinDAO as</strong> infrastructure</strong>. It also requires domain expertise to develop, operate, iterate on, and maintain the machine learning sybil detection pipeline.</p>
<p>Additionally, <strong>FDD has arguably managed to create one of the most distinctive initiatives on Web3 <strong>so far in terms of real-world Sybil Account Detection - one of the space‚Äôs biggest challenges, especially where quadratic voting is employed. The unique blend of experts together with the</strong> holistic / integrated processes that were battle-tested on one of the Web3 mostly used platforms</strong> is certainly something to be proud of. Something that can also be <strong>leveraged and used by all value-aligned platforms on which their success depends on reaching out to real users without compromising</strong> on their privacy or incentive alignments.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Given the above considerations</strong>, it can be helpful to also share some thinking about what can be a possible strategic direction and a proposal for next steps.</p>
<p>We want to ensure FDD and GitcoinDAO have incentive alignment AND <strong>functional alignment</strong> to defend against sybils. <strong>I have written a tale below that provides an analogy for what is functional alignment in this case.</strong></p>
<p>We think it could be possible for FDD to evolve further from a GitcoinDAO core team, to become its own DAO that is a service provider to Gitcoin, and potentially other DAOs. FDD is a critical function for DAO maintenance (especially with Quadratic Voting), but it also may likely be a useful service to other DAOs, which would reduce cost dependencies on GitcoinDAO.</p>
<p>This being true, then it could be the best long-term sustainable path by both improving the sybil detection (through bi-directional interface points with other data partners) and reducing the cost to GitcoinDAO as various ecosystem partners will be involved in the usage and cost sharing on this new Sybil Detection DAO.</p>
<hr>
<p>The next step is to <strong>Explore</strong>. To sketch how it could look like and to map its limitations and opportunities. To discuss as much as possible while there aren‚Äôt points of no return. To have a document which allows the community at large to constructively criticize and reject in detail or in its whole form. This is the core intent and function of the SDD work-stream, and it is expected to take the following form:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deliverable: A written briefing report that includes:
<ul>
<li>Definition of a clear purpose and functional remit for SDD</li>
<li>Diagrams/sketches of potential SDD token governance and economic systems</li>
<li>Summary of the results of discussions with potential data partners and scoping of bi-directional interface points</li>
<li>Description of a technical roadmap for making SDD viable</li>
<li>Recommended next steps</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Method: a 3-phase process, on which:
<ul>
<li>Phase 1: Freestyle sketching
<ul>
<li>A strawman sketch will be produced based on the combined knowledge of how the SDD + ecosystem tech &amp; dynamics is playing right now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Phase 2: Intense Iterations
<ul>
<li>The strawman sketch will pass through extensive review from SMEs to ensure that its cohesive and viable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Phase 3: Polish &amp; Communicate
<ul>
<li>The iterated document will be transformed and published into an form that invites public-facing iterations &amp; criticisms</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>I hope these thoughts help share the broader context going into this function, its value to GitcoinDAO and the broader ecosystem, and the potential strategic direction.</p>

<p>(If is too wacky, replace DCG Factory ‚Üí Factory, and Sybil Detection ‚Üí Electricity)</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs imagine a fictitious factory. The <strong>Decentralized Common Goods (DCG) Factory,</strong> which is owned and <strong>managed by the diligent Quadratic Bot</strong>, which <strong>concerns itself only with maximizing the quality</strong> and the positive externalities of what‚Äôs being produced.</p>
<p>Quadratic Bot knows that the DCG Factory consumes a lot of Sybil Detection energy, and <strong>in order to have consistent production results, he decides to purchase and operate its own Sybil Detection Generator, which provides this critical piece of infrastructure</strong> to the factory to be autonomous.</p>
<p>At some point in time, Quadratic Bot decides that <strong>the factory should be less monolithic and that its core functions should be more decentralized</strong> and autonomous. <strong>As a result of that, the Sybil Detection Generator now has its own manager: Not-Sybil</strong>.</p>
<p>Not-Sybil, which is as diligent as Quadratic Bot, also only concerns himself with the quality and the positive externalities of what‚Äôs produced too. The product in this case is delivering the best Sybil Detection to his users.</p>
<p><strong>As the DCG Factory is decentralized and open-source, the commoners of the local village quickly take notice</strong> of all the innovation happening inside it, including the Sybil Detection Generator, which is tailored end-to-end for being as optimal as possible for its function.</p>
<p>Not-Sybil, observing the demand for Sybil Detection and taking in mind his mission of maximizing positive externalities, decides that it can be a good idea to expand the Sybil Detection Generator capacity and technology for more deeply integrating with the community demands.</p>
<p>Quadratic Bot is enthusiastic, but this capacity is way more than he needs, and it is not obvious how the payoff is going to be in terms of the quality improval on the factory products. It may even be a distraction.</p>
<p><strong>Quadratic Bot and Not-Sybil are intertwined in a dilemma</strong>. There are <strong>no questions about the history and the ownership</strong>: it was Quadratic Bot who bought and took the risk for the Sybil Detection Ownership. But now that it is being managed by Not-Sybil, the goals are different. <strong>Quadratic Bot wants the generator to provide critical services. Not-Sybil wants the generator to provide the best services.</strong></p>
<p>How do we untangle that? <strong>One option is to re-absorb the Sybil Detection Generator</strong> under the Quadratic Bot guidance and dismiss / re-educate Not-Sybil. Make it provide the critical service again.</p>
<p><strong>Another one is to imagine a future where the Sybil Detection Generator becomes its own autonomous organization</strong>. On which Sybil Detection is also a decentralized common good product too, which is used as a critical service by multiple villages and projects.</p>
<p>The future is uncertain and risky. <strong>Discovering and mapping it beforehand, and making explicit the landmarks and obstacles can allow for us to have a grasp of the journey without taking points of no return.</strong></p>

<p>hey Joe, voter turnout on this looks a bit low.  i wonder how we can get that up.</p>
<p>there are many options in the poll, which can be complicated for stewards to wade through.</p>
<p>from speaking with stewards, i perceive that many of them would be aligned with the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>lean Grants 1.0/ GR14 sybil protection &amp; grants approvals</li>
<li>Grants 2.0 rebuild for decentralization/protocol-centric fraud defense</li>
</ol>
<p>i wonder if a more thematic poll with fewer options would yield more turnout?</p>

<p>DD is a cost center, like DAO Ops and should be focused on maintaining as slim of an operating budget as possible. Gitcoin seems to be paying for the education and advancement of a number of ideas - Sybil DAO, Most of ‚ÄúEvolution‚Äù, Catalyst, etc. without any discernible increase in value being delivered back to the DAO. Cutting most of ‚ÄúEvolution‚Äù, scaling back ‚ÄúSybil defenders‚Äù and doing a deeper dive on the value of GIA would be valuable</p>

<p>Thank you on behalf of the GIA <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">  We appreciate your praises and the fact that you have noticed us  means we are getting stuff done and that‚Äôs nice‚Ä¶we have actually worked a lot and also put in a lot of passion, late hours and brain matter <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/brain.png?v=12" title=":brain:" class="emoji" alt=":brain:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> into defending Gitcoin from threats to its credible neutrality. It‚Äôs not easy for us to make friends when our mission is to maintain fairness  (in the degree that we can and are allowed). We are decentralizing more and more each round and building, modelling based on our results. We work very closely with the ‚ÄúSybil defenders‚Äù and the data science <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/omnianalytics">@omnianalytics</a> have been slowly but surely  building on our results. We are working to become a fine tuned machine that has the purpose to integrate with Grants 2.0</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not healthy to compare things, but I was want to give this as an example:</p>
<p><em>I personally help out with the MMM(because I love it) pro bono because I like co-hosting and participating in fun events that are beneficial for Gitcoin and the web3 space overall. I don‚Äôt have the deepest understanding on what‚Äôs going on over there, but I do find it intriguing that the MMMs budget is a decent amount and it was approved by almost everyone, which signals that the work and outcomes generated by them are visible, while it seems that our collective work in the FDD has not reached the same level of awareness‚Ä¶  <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=12" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></em></p>

            <p>This is a step in the right direction - I really appreciate the bucketing - but I still feel a little DDoS attacked (to steal anon‚Äôs on-point wording) even when looking at this view.</p>
<p>I said this to <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/kishoraditya">@kishoraditya</a> just now about something else - ‚ÄúI think the challenge with FDD‚Äôs ‚Äúat a glance‚Äù stuff so far is that it‚Äôs still quite complex - e.g., the bucketing of what FDD is focused on in the four buckets is a step in the right direction, but understanding 30 broad strokes bullet points and what‚Äôs underlying them is still far, far too granular / lacking context to be a summary‚Äù</p>
<p>As a Steward coming in to review this, my head goes towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the top 1-2 priority / impact items in each of the four buckets?</li>
<li>What is the resource allocation / rationale for each of those?</li>
</ul>
<p>That is where I would want to start to make sure I‚Äôm understanding &amp; agreeing with the most critical items. Beyond that, as a Steward, I care less about understanding the long-tail (unless, of course, it‚Äôs taking up substantial budget - in which case I would want to go into its rationale, but only after understanding the core pieces).</p>

            <p>I‚Äôve gotten feedback about people not understanding what is going on in the workstream. It seems that there are many impressions about what the stream is, or should be, but they have missed the ongoing effort due to our having too much content to review.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI feel somewhat DDos attacked when I read FDD budget‚Äù</p>
<p>Here are a few ways to look at it.</p>
<p>First, check out this explainer from Octopus <a href="https://youtu.be/GrYD_gTHgys" class="inline-onebox">octopus Thoughts On FDD - YouTube</a></p>
<p>Next, you can see how evolution is more about understanding what we did the last round, finding what is and isn‚Äôt working, and then converting to a better overall process. It is not redundant with DAOops.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don‚Äôt think the grants 2.0 architecture will solve this through ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù but rather by giving communities tools to provide legitimacy (sybil defense) and credible neutrality (community consent). These communities would then compete for mechanisms that truly work better for their participants. Basically, our longer term strategies for sybil and grant eligibility have a by product of collusion protection, but this has not been a focus in the last few rounds.</p>

<p>For grants 2.0, users will have a dPoPP. By integrating many services, they will be able to participate meaningfully. By only allowing them to advance by integration, we would be putting new users at a disadvantage in the system. How might we provide the new and disadvantaged users the same access to the system. (That is the point afterall)</p>
<p>Our job is to find a way to decentralized the inputs, remove PII from the equation, and still be able to make sense of the rich history of participation users will acquire on dPoPP.</p>

<p>And reduce unwanted bias. Additionally, I think providing a solution which includes legitmacy and credible neutrality to any ecosystem who starts a round is a part of grants 2.0, not just an accessory.</p>
<p>If we hand them the 2.0 rails without this protection, they may use 2.0 and get worse results than legacy systems. The reason a community would want to use grants 2.0 is to allocate better.</p>

[Cancelled/Superceded S14 Proposal] FDD Season 14 Budget Request
      

[Cancelled/Superceded S14 Proposal] FDD Season 14 Budget Request
kyle

            <p>I really appreciate the thoughts from <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/annika">@annika</a> and agree with so many points she made:<br>
1 - Being a cost center is not a bad thing, and shouldn‚Äôt be viewed as a criticism<br>
2 - It‚Äôs been difficult to navigate the story line on the value being delivered<br>
3 - Sybil defense is important work and needs to be part of any QF round</p>
<p>For my own edification I have tried to break down the core work FDD does<br>
1 - Primary scope:<br>
1.1 - Defend Grants Rounds from Sybil Attacks<br>
1.2 - Review Grants to confirm compliance to our rules/policies<br>
1.3 - Defend against collusion attacks</p>
<p>2 - Secondary scope:<br>
2.1 - Generate ML models to run programmatic sybil detection (using the centralized data set, and a growing on-chain data set)<br>
2.2 - Conduct human review of potential Sybils<br>
2.3 - Build/invest in tooling to make 1.1 and 1.2 more scalable and approachable<br>
2.4 - Invest in OS and working norms (and operations) for the workstream</p>
<p>Is this accurate? I am trying to keep this as ‚Äúpure‚Äù of a scope as possible.</p>

<p>Yes, and‚Ä¶ Sybil defense is an unsolved research problem with a total addressable market of everyone on earth and not a person more!</p>
<p>When we find solutions for unsolved problems with a large TAM, should we generalize the solution and have Gitcoin invest in it, or even own it outright?</p>
<p>Should we only allow certain workstreams to do this?</p>
<p>I guess I only agree that it is not gross GMV generative if you don‚Äôt consider a fair mechanism to be something that attracts more participants.</p>

<p>Yes. Then please explain why every other workstream should have higher budgets if this is true?

<p>Especially when you consider it is an unsolved research problem with a red-team blue team aspect continually changing the strategy and it is core to the grants 2.0 roadmap.</p>
<p>With a cost center, you can set and maintain a strategy. With this work, we have to innovate every round and try to stay ahead of the attacks as the honeypot gets larger and larger.</p>

[Cancelled/Superceded S14 Proposal] FDD Season 14 Budget Request
annika

            <p>Jumping in to provide my two cents as I go through all the proposals.</p>
<p>This is probably the toughest proposal of them all for me to review &amp; comment on. On one hand, FDD does important work that is critical to our mission. On the other hand, I share the concerns raised by others around FDD‚Äôs rising costs.</p>
<p>I agree with the assessment that FDD is a cost center - if we didn‚Äôt have the problem of sybil attacks, we wouldn‚Äôt spend money on fraud detection; it is not GMV-generative. This view is reinforced by FDD‚Äôs own stated workstream mandate - ‚Äúdefend Gitcoin from threats‚Äù; it‚Äôs here to protect downside, rather than to generate upside. And that‚Äôs just fine. Being a cost center is by no means a bad thing, and doesn‚Äôt make the work FDD does any less important - calling something a ‚Äòcost center‚Äô shouldn‚Äôt be viewed as an attack or as a diminishing sentiment. Without the work FDD does, we would not have a viable grants program. Sybil resistance is work to be extremely proud of.</p>
<p>That said, I do worry about FDD‚Äôs rising costs, and frankly, the budget request and supporting documents are extremely cumbersome to review - after going through them all, I still don‚Äôt feel confident in having a clear assessment of this workstream and what, at a macro level, FDD is building towards. I feel like I need someone to summarize it all for me - and that shouldn‚Äôt be the case, given how closely I work with FDD.</p>
<p>I believe others have shared similar feedback, and so I will wait to see what the resolution is before making a decision on voting.</p>

            <p>What I can do to help with the current market and reduce our spending (Only for the ASOP + Human Evaluation)</p>
<p>Instead of scaling up the team I will limit it and reduce the Numbers or contributors/Human Evaluators to 5 only.</p>
<p>Here is a brief resume of what I am anticipating:</p>
<p><strong>Breaking down GR13: Total amount of contributor</strong>: 35<br>
35 x 500$ = 17,500$ (¬± 11,000 Evaluations) (300 Evaluations each)<br>
<strong>Poap creation (Bounty)</strong>: 250$<br>
Workshop session: 2<br>
35 x 50$ x 2 = 3,500$<br>
<strong>Total</strong>: 21,250$</p>
<p><strong>Breaking down GR14: Total amount of contributors</strong>: 5<br>
12,000 Evaluation / 60 Minutes = 200 Hrs<br>
200 Hrs / 5 Human Evaluators = 40 Hrs<br>
40 Hrs / 5 Rounds (June 9, June 11, June 13, June 15, June 17) = 8 Hrs <strong>Non-Stop For each Day</strong><br>
40 Hrs x 60?$/Hrs = 2,400$ x 5 = 12,000$<br>
<strong>Poap Creation (Bounty)</strong>: 250$<br>
<strong>Workshop session</strong>: 2<br>
5 x 50$ x 2 = 500$<br>
<strong>New Total</strong>: 12,750$<br>
<strong>Amount saved</strong>: 8,500$</p>
<p>This is of course only an small-scale of the total amount that we are requesting. I‚Äôll need to work on the operation side to see where we can cut the budget. Writing this here in the hope that this will help other to do the same with their own initiative, if not, then we might have to lay-off contributors or even partially remove some initiative/inventiveness.</p>
