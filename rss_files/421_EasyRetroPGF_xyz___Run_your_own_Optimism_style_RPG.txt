https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/easyretropgf-xyz-run-your-own-optimism-style-rpgf-round/17407
    Hi everyone, I wanted to let you know about the launch of EasyRetroPGF.xyz - a new tool to allow anyone to do Opimtism style RPGF .

Check out the [launch tweet](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1745845124913914028) or the post on the [OP gov forum](https://gov.optimism.io/t/easyretropgf-xyz-run-your-own-optimism-style-rpgf-round/7359) here, which I have helpfully pasted below.

----

Hi Optimism Collective,

WEST Software Services (entity through which I contribute to public goods projects like Gitcoin + Optimism) built one of the two frontends for Optimism RPGF Round 3 => https://round3.optimism.io/

The software was originally developed for [this RFP](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/104), but we are now open sourcing it and releasing it for others' use.

That means it‚Äôs now easy to run an Optimism-style RPGF Round. We are calling this tool stack EasyRetroPGF, and it is available now.

1. Demo https://easy-retro-pgf.vercel.app/
2. Code: https://github.com/gitcoinco/easy-retro-pgf/
3. Deploy: [Deploy on Vercel](https://github.com/gitcoinco/easy-retro-pgf/blob/main/docs/01_setup.md)
4. Configure: Checkout the configuration variables to see all the diff ways this can be configured to run on diff chains + configuration variables [here.](https://github.com/gitcoinco/easy-retro-pgf/blob/main/.env.example)
5. Product/Research Design: [telegram group](https://t.me/+wknfJtfyiYcyNDkx)
6. Technical Support: [telegram group](https://t.me/+0oycDCvX3QY1NjEx)

If this EasyRetroPGF.xyz tool is strongly embraced by the OP Collective, we will continue to maintain it + upgrade it for OP RPGF 4 + beyond.

## Gitcoin <3s RPGF

In addition to maintaining the above software suite, Gitcoin has been doing more [Retroactive Public Goods Funding Rounds on Grants Stack](https://www.gitcoin.co/grants-stack/rpgf). We view RPGF as being complementary to Quadratic Funding - which we have historically been known for.

One of our core beliefs about grants is that they‚Äôre both necessary for sustainable growth, and also incredibly early. This even applies to QF and RPGF. We‚Äôve been talking to other ecosystems who want to launch their own version of RPGF and aren‚Äôt sure how to set it up for success. With that in mind, we‚Äôre open-sourcing not just the app but our product development process for RPGF. If you‚Äôd like to be a design partner or beta tester of our RPGF efforts, join our [telegram group here](https://t.me/+wknfJtfyiYcyNDkx).

Whether you‚Äôve run grants programs before or are just getting started, we‚Äôd love to learn about your goals and work with you to bring RPGF to your ecosystem. We‚Äôll work with our design group to capture our learnings and share publicly to help grow + expand RPGF usage.

## Gitcoin/Optimism Alignment üü¢ü§ùüî¥

We have always felt very mission aligned with Optimism. Here are a couple data points.

1. OP/GC have similar missions regarding public goods.
2. Plasma Group (the corporate predecessor to Optimism) raised money on Gitcoin Grants during round 1, 2, and 3.
3. Plasma Group [were some](https://decrypt.co/16334/ethereums-plasma-group-shuts-down-passes-funds-to-gitcoin) of the earliest funders of the Gitcoin Grants Matching Pool.
4. Gitcoin donors [were rewarded in OP Airdrop 1](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/airdrop-1/).
5. Optimism was one of the first L2s that Gitcoin Grants Stack supported.
6. I‚Äôve done a handful of [greenpill episodes with members of Optimism](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=optimism+greenpill).
7. https://publicgoods.network/ (a L2 for supporting public goods which Gitcoin has helped to seed) was built on top of OP Stack + is part of the superchain.
8. I‚Äôve [participated](https://owocki.com/onchain-summit-panel-funding-public-goods/) in the OP Onchain summit in Istanbul, and we‚Äôve also done public speaking together at [Schelling Point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYKHnYSChEs&list=PLvTrX8LNPbPlLNcFPuWiac3W19cUSaKFF&index=13) (on [multiple occasions](https://x.com/schellingpoint_/status/1725407705257374014?s=20)).
9. We‚Äôve commissioned custom art about [Ethers Phoenix](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1519735747024240646).
10. In RPGF Round 3, we build the [round3.optimism.io](http://round3.optimism.io) interface for the OP collective.

I hope that we are not stepping on any toes by open sourcing the RPGF tool we‚Äôve built for yall. I‚Äôve shopped this idea around a few people in the OP collective who are close to RPGF and they said they wanted to see it happen (and that it helps build the meme of RPGF to have more orgs doing it). But if I missed the mark in any way feel free to comment below or email me [kevin@gitcoin.co](mailto:kevin@gitcoin.co) or DM me twitter.com/owocki

Public Goods are Good ü´°

            <p>given this overlap, it would be nice if the OP Grants and + Gitcoin Grants could be managed in a ‚Äúcommon app‚Äù.   such an app would allow people to manage their grant in 1 place + push it to multiple grant programs.  saving time and enegy, similar to how the common app for college applications works in the US.</p>
