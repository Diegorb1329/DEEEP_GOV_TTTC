* [Huxwell](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/huxwell/summary) provides [an update on dCompass](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-dcompass-season-13-budget-request/9794/15) which shows how adventurers can complete quizzes to receive rewards and quest creators can configure how the rewards are delivered. A staging app on testnet to test the first quests is set to go live this week.

* [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary) shares [Lessons about Impact Networks](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/lessons-about-impact-networks/10305) from the book ‚Äú[Impact Networks](https://www.amazon.com/Impact-Networks-Connection-Collaboration-Catalyze/dp/1523091681/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=impact+networks&qid=1649089245&sprefix=impact+ne%2Caps%2C108&sr=8-1)‚Äù by D Ehrlihman. Impact Networks are ‚Äúlike DAOs but without tokens‚Äù and ‚Äú[relationships] between network participants is the core basis of trust that allows for antifragility of the network.‚Äù

* Get a special sneak preview of the [Future History of the Open Internet Book](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/future-history-of-the-open-internet-book/10324), and [The ImpactDAO Poster/Book](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-impactdao-poster-book-is-here/10323) from [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary)! You can also see the physical copies (and maybe grab one) at [Schelling Point Amsterdam](https://schellingpoint.gitcoin.co/).

* In [Hype Cycles - a tool for sensemaking](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/hype-cycles-a-tool-for-sensemaking/10267/2), [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary) drills down into five phases of emerging technology lifecycles: Innovation Trigger, Peak of Inflated Expectations, Trough of Disillusionment, Slope of Enlightenment, & Plateau of Productivity.

* In [The Plateau of Productivity üåÑ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-plateau-of-productivity/10269), [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary) continues the discussion about [Garner Hype Cycles](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/hype-cycles-a-tool-for-sensemaking/10267/) by contextualizing them using the history of Gitcoin Grants. In 2022, with a DAO standing up and Grants 2.0 on its way, ‚Äúwe are further along in the trough of disillusionment, but the plateau of productivity is perhaps in sight.‚Äù

* [Simona Pop](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/pop/summary) shares [a timeline for workstreams](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/season-13-2-1-4-30-aligning-the-workstream-budgets-to-make-life-easier-for-the-stewards/9738/8) to share their Season 14 Budgets. Workstream leads are expected to share their budget request on the forum by April 28th.

* The [treasury diversification working group let us know](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/treasury-diversification-working-group-updates-thread/10231/4) that they had calls with potential lead partners and welcomes you to [send your recommendations](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/treasury-diversification-part-ii-welcoming-strategic-partners/9825) for strategic partners.

* In [An Evolutionary Lens on Web3/Open Source Software üîé](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/an-evolutionary-lens-on-web3-open-source-software/10293), [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary) discusses the key properties that allowed Linux to evolve and how Web3 can learn from this. This thread highlights how Web3 technology has already had a spectacular evolution, partly because it adds global coordination and incentivisation layers to what makes OSS work.

## [üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Workstream Discussion](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/workstream-discussion/9)

### [üå± Public Goods Funding](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Public-Goods-4ccd579f433c4dff9d8952314468d6e8)

* Every Wednesday, the Public Goods Library hosts a philosophical discussion in the Gitcoin Discord server, with topics ranging from DAOs, community, governance, and everything in between that ties back to web3 and public goods. Check out one of our past calls on [Micropayments and Calm Design](https://youtu.be/3YPpEwjbj9I) by [Amber Case](https://www.caseorganic.com/)! (start video at 3:10)

* We are aiming to [ratify the results of grants round 13](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-ratify-the-results-of-grants-round-13-and-formally-request-the-community-multisig-holders-to-payout-matching-allocations/10278) and invite our stewards to comment!

* The Grants team is actively working on a framework for mutual grants (swaps) to help ensure we are acting as effective metagovernance stewards.

* We are currently working hard on the workstream budget and optimizing our ops!

### [üöÄ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-prototyping-workstream-moonshot-budget-request-q4-2021/8785) [Moonshot Collective](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Moonshot-Collective-ffa78f44a0de412cb607f9b69d3a376f)

* [Green Pill Podcast Episode 7](https://availableon.com/greenpill) hosted by [Kevin Owocki](https://twitter.com/owocki) is live! This episode features [Glen Weyl](https://twitter.com/glenweyl), founder of [RadicalxChange](https://twitter.com/RadxChange) and one of the pioneers of Quadratic Voting. They discuss the future of Quadratic Funding and using the power of markets for the good of society.

* Every month Moonshot Collective Devs demo their projects for the community. April demos happened on Monday the 4th. If you missed it, you can watch them on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfbOba7iD19HyrB9QbV6Uww).

### [üíô Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Fraud-Detection-Defense-2bde13c0b8e74fda81435d94e49e2703)

* [Joe](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/disruptionjoe/summary) delivers the [GR13 Governance Brief](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gr13-governance-brief/10289) which outlines the FDD workstreams efforts to improve Sybil Defense, Grants Review, and Data Access. Sybil Defense makes use of Humans-In-The-Loop (HITL) machine-learning and in round 13 delivered a 100% increase in the number of human evaluations with a 300% decrease in cost. Grants Reviews were conducted by the new Grants Intelligence Agency (GIA) which had to use a ‚Äúplan B‚Äù system in lieu of the data access they needed to use a newly developed tool. The GIA also conducted a review of Grants Eligibility Policy following the BrightID case.

* We are working on an analysis of ‚Äúairdrop farming‚Äù a type of collusion behavior we found certain grants and users to be propagating during round 13.

This basic income is intended to increase contributor retention and pay for their ability to stay up to date with all communication channels.

Sybil Defense makes use of Humans-In-The-Loop (HITL) machine-learning and in round 13 delivered a 100% increase in the number of human evaluations with a 300% decrease in cost. Grants Reviews were conducted by the new Grants Intelligence Agency (GIA) which had to use a ‚Äúplan B‚Äù system in lieu of the data access they needed to use a newly developed tool. The GIA also conducted a review of Grants Eligibility Policy following the BrightID case.</p>
