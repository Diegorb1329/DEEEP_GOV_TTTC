https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/weekly-grants-2-0-update-2022-6-14/10916
    Grants 2.0 is an open-source technology for plural and scalable public goods provision. We are building a modular toolkit for Quadratic Funding and adjacent social incentive designs to increase and govern ecosystem capital.

# 2022/6/14 Update

by @brent (Passport), @michelle_ma (Grants Hub), and @nategosselin (Round Manager) 

## Highlights
- Last week came with both the highs and lows. To kick things off, the Passport had a great first day - breaking 1000 Passports submitted to Grants in the first 24 hours and with minimal issues. Day 2 came, and our ceramic infrastructure started to feel the weight of all the traffic. Part of the pains of launching an "Alpha" Product like this is learning as you go, and this week had no shortage of learning. This week will be spent still stabilizing our ceramic infrastructure while preparing for a hackathon
- Last week, Grants Hub was 100% dev-complete with the Grant Hub Phase 1 (MVP). We will spend the next 2-3 weeks getting Grant Hub production-ready (deadline 7/1) and kick off Grant Hub Phase 2 (Anchor) this upcoming Monday, 6/13.
- The Round Manager now has milestones and a demo! The team spent some time this week breaking down the planned goals for Round Manager, turning them into actionable chunks, and aligning on our [overall MVP scope/timeline](https://www.notion.so/MVP-9227f130e5d74e078cd43cd704340c5a). Our goal is to be code complete with our MVP by 7/5/22. With this week‚Äôs progress, we have completed about 85% of our [Steel Thread](https://www.notion.so/Steel-Thread-fd85d8ce97c4420f84828fdb3e0c1f91) and are about 20% of the way towards hitting our MVP milestone. The team's ongoing debate was whether we needed a "program" shell for MVP and whether that program should be saved on-chain (vs. housed in a centralized database). While there were some UX benefits to housing program metadata (such as operator wallets) in a centralized store, we felt that the overall benefits of pursuing a decentralized program store were much greater and have decided to pursue that route.
