* The discussion around [Redistribute GTC to Individuals Who Could Not Claim Due to Error](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-redistribute-gtc-to-individuals-who-could-not-claim-due-to-error/8782) is ongoing with the author [Tardigrade](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/Tardigrade) continuing to [answer questions](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-redistribute-gtc-to-individuals-who-could-not-claim-due-to-error/8782/10) regarding the proposal.

## [üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Workstream Discussion](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/workstream-discussion/9)

### üå± [Public Goods Funding](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-public-goods-funding/129)

* [The Library](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Enter-the-Library-867e8df229374e1f97cae7eae45e5681) continues to bring together a fantastic group of people to discuss public goods each week.

* A second RFP, continuing the ethos of [Seeking a New Kind of Public Good](https://gitcoin.co/blog/seeking-a-new-kind-of-public-good/), is in planning.

* Over $600k has been raised so far for Grants Round 12 and partnership discussions with other web3 x social impact organizations have begun.

* The first workstream payments have been made to key contributors in the Public Goods workstream. Formal accounting will be moving into cross-DAO ops in time for the second budget proposal. Progress has been made on onboarding, which will also move into a larger cross-DAO ops initiative

### [üöÄ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-prototyping-workstream-moonshot-budget-request-q4-2021/8785) [Moonshot Collective](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-public-goods-prototyping/130)

* The vote to ratify the Moonshot Collective[ budget request](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-prototyping-workstream-moonshot-budget-request-q4-2021/8785) for Q4 2021 has [passed](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/QmUMKpGM6daj2Lo7Wb8urz6hG4gvfoDu94fpBgueRZGYDi) and is now [live on Tally](https://www.withtally.com/governance/gitcoin/proposal/8) for a formal on-chain vote.

* [The Greatest LARP](https://greatestlarp.com) launched on Wednesday, October 20 to great fanfare! So far 4 of 5 ETHBot Statues have been sold, as well as 158 ETHBot NFTs. The next level will be unlocked once 200 ETHBot NFTs have been minted. More than $180,000 has been raised to fund public goods so far. [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki) authored a [thread](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-governance-question-for-greatestlarp-com/8848) describing the ‚ÄúWomp womp‚Äù-mechanism and [a poll](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-governance-question-for-greatestlarp-com/8848/20) to determine if, and how it should be used. The poll [resulted](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-governance-question-for-greatestlarp-com/8848/24) in executing the Womp womps around 9am MST every day, Kevin will post in the [telegram channe](https://t.me/joinchat/ekBANXnlwcQ1NzRh)l when the txns are submitted.

* Every Friday the Moonshot Collective gets together to show off their progress. Individual projects demo what they‚Äôve been working on. This week three projects shared their work: Anon Vs Moloch, Moonswap, and Decentralized Recruiter. Demo videos for each project can be found on [this YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVupIN3GgLtj6ZjXCvDed6WPXZCf4mU7l).

* Follow [@MoonshotCollect](https://twitter.com/MoonshotCollect) onTwitter for frequent updates. Learn more by saying [hello in Discord](https://gitcoin.co/discord), or checking out our [site](https://moonshotcollective.space/).

### üåê [Decentralize Gitcoin](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-decentralize-gitcoin/180)

* [The dGTC Workstream Q4 Budget Proposal](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-decentralize-gitcoin-workstream-budget-request-q4-2021/8895) has been posted on the forum by [Philip](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/phutchins) for review. The proposal brings the Data & DevOps project into this workstream. A team to design a sybil score aggregation protocol and build a POC implementation will be added. The workstream is also planning to add community contributors to the dGrants team to increase velocity and scale.

* The [Moonshot Collective dGrants Round Proof of Concept](https://grants.gtcdao.net/) is currently running and is scheduled to end on Sunday, October 31st at 11:59PM EST. As of Wednesday morning, Oct 27, the round had 11 grants and $5,449.54 worth of matching funds available. A total of 14 grants have been created and approved with 105 contributions.
   We‚Äôd love for you to test with us! Fund your favorite grant or builder before matching ends on Sunday and provide feedback in the Discord channel [#dgtc-feedback](https://discord.gg/A44BkknX) (under Decentralize Gitcoin).

### üíô [Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)](https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/Fraud-Detection-Defense-f1a2969a9f324f57a02ef69a60b25cae)

* [The FDD Q4 Budget Proposal](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-request-to-fund-fdd-workstream-q4-2021-budget/8857) will be moving to Snapshot after healthy deliberation on the forum. [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki) [expressed concern](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-request-to-fund-fdd-workstream-q4-2021-budget/8857/6) about CrossStream DAOops & Community initiatives being included in the FDD Budget. FDD had brought the issue to the CrossStream DAOops Governance (CSDG) last Tuesday and passed a proposal to include these streams funding as to not interrupt contributor payments, but intending to spin out these streams. Multiple CSDG reps were in Lisbon last week and missed the vote.

* For decisions that affect all streams, the CSDG has reps from each stream which vote on the proposal before changes are made. They hand it off to a specialist squad to drive a solution, which then is approved by the CSDG before implementation. After [Owocki](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki)‚Äôs post on the proposal in the Governance forum, FDD brought the proposal back to CSDG again this Tuesday. The conclusion was that the FDD budget will include these initiatives, however, FDD will expedite the creation of a multisig with one rep from each workstream to govern the CrossStream DAO Ops funding.

* Another decision is that the FDD Legal & Accounting Squads will be integrated into the CrossStream DAOops, this will be a gradual process, with support of Kyle and Joe.

* The FDD workstream published a document outlining the [State of FDD Q3 2021](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uEuGe5OOecLyAsLbgnqaLplaH8ycU4zej3c-mv6QHTI/edit?usp=sharing). The document describes the role of defending Gitcoin, how FDD provides value to the Gitcoin community, FDD‚Äôs vision, mission, values, strategies, how FDD plans to progressively decentralize, Q3 accomplishments & Q4 deliverables. Includes a breakdown of all initiatives & squads. Worth a read if you want to get a better handle on this workstream!

### üé® [Merch, Memes & Marketing](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-suggestion-mmm-merch-memes-marketing-for-public-goods-gitcoin-gitcoindao/7066)

* The MMM Q4 budget is live on [Tally](https://www.withtally.com/governance/gitcoin/proposal/7) to get ratified on-chain, please vote to ensure we reach quorum!

* [A design bounty](https://github.com/gitcoinco/creative/issues/412) for Grants Round 12 was posted. For Grants Round 12 going forward, design bounties will be funded and maintained by MMM (previously supported by the Gitcoin Holdings design team).

* MMM is representing Gitcoin DAO at the [ForeFront DAOlloween](https://ff.mirror.xyz/j_9eeNjtiXd0TYqMN6WCMexUFHcjbPUnxJsIog2sU78) event in gather.town this Friday, the 29th. This is a special-themed metaverse networking event where ticket holders ‚Äúgather‚Äù in the metaverse to get acquainted with representatives from other sponsoring DAOs. Special tokens and POAPs will be rewarded to lucky participants.

* Matthew proposed [‚ÄúMMM Raids‚Äù](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NELqWafJQZkY05QE3E9ImSmfnoSzNnjUvKaH4gycLKw/edit?usp=sharing) to scale operations. MMM Raids are ‚Äúan efficient and flexible way for people to request, approve, disperse, and account for funds in MMM initiatives, with minimal bureaucracy and maximum transparency.‚Äù

* To request or propose a new project for MMM - please fill out the [MMM-Request Typeform](https://form.typeform.com/to/iM5lAFFD)!

## üìÖ [Upcoming community events](https://www.addevent.com/calendar/pz351122)

* Drop in on our weekly [DAO Vibes & Office Hours w. Kevin Owocki](https://www.addevent.com/event/Vn9031075) on Wednesdays at 12PM EDT in [Discord](http://gitcoin.co/discord)! We have been seeing great attendance and engagement.

The next one is Wednesday, November 10, 12:00pm - 1:00pm ET. (If you haven‚Äôt applied, [do this first!](https://form.typeform.com/to/DiMdHaWe))

According to Anett, ‚ÄúThe idea to host unconference sessions is to meet stewards & friends and have non formal chats together, share memes, share whatever we want. The outcome should be to build relationships as the DAO moves faster when people know each other and create a more friendly atmosphere in DAO.‚Äù

<p><a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-request-to-fund-fdd-workstream-q4-2021-budget/8857">The FDD Q4 Budget Proposal</a> will be moving to Snapshot after healthy deliberation on the forum. <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">Owocki</a> <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-request-to-fund-fdd-workstream-q4-2021-budget/8857/6">expressed concern</a> about CrossStream DAOops &amp; Community initiatives being included in the FDD Budget. FDD had brought the issue to the CrossStream DAOops Governance (CSDG) last Tuesday and passed a proposal to include these streams funding as to not interrupt contributor payments, but intending to spin out these streams. Multiple CSDG reps were in Lisbon last week and missed the vote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For decisions that affect all streams, the CSDG has reps from each stream which vote on the proposal before changes are made. They hand it off to a specialist squad to drive a solution, which then is approved by the CSDG before implementation. After <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">Owocki</a>‚Äôs post on the proposal in the Governance forum, FDD brought the proposal back to CSDG again this Tuesday. The conclusion was that the FDD budget will include these initiatives, however, FDD will expedite the creation of a multisig with one rep from each workstream to govern the CrossStream DAO Ops funding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another decision is that the FDD Legal &amp; Accounting Squads will be integrated into the CrossStream DAOops, this will be a gradual process, with support of Kyle and Joe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The FDD workstream published a document outlining the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uEuGe5OOecLyAsLbgnqaLplaH8ycU4zej3c-mv6QHTI/edit?usp=sharing">State of FDD Q3 2021</a>. The document describes the role of defending Gitcoin, how FDD provides value to the Gitcoin community, FDD‚Äôs vision, mission, values, strategies, how FDD plans to progressively decentralize, Q3 accomplishments &amp; Q4 deliverables. Includes a breakdown of all initiatives &amp; squads. Worth a read if you want to get a better handle on this workstream!</p>
