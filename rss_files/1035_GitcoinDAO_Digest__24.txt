* Thanks to the help of our amazing community, The GreatestLARP raised over $500K for public goods.

### :globe_with_meridians: [Decentralize Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Decentralize-Gitcoin-c3197f918bf640bc9809cd26d56c93f3)

* This new [dGrants dashboard](https://dune.xyz/fronk/gitcoin-dgrants-gr12) shows key stats for GR12 and will be used for future rounds!
* The Gitcoin Building Gitcoin round has received 1385 contributions valued at over $4718 across 39 grants with an average contribution amount of 3.4 DAI

* Our workstream held a [dGrants workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17I7dBdMn3A) which is intended to be the first of a series that goes into a deep dive of the various sections and components of dGrants

* We are currently addressing the questions that we have received around a grant determined to be related to a sanctioned country

* The DevOps sub-stream is building a VPN service to increase the level of security around our data.

### :blue_heart: [Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Fraud-Detection-Defense-f1a2969a9f324f57a02ef69a60b25cae)

* Operations

  * Building the FDD Operating System to restructure and smooth out the governance process as FDD continues its push towards decentralization. A framework for ‚Äúminimal viable governance‚Äù is being worked on by core contributors. This includes councils rather than leads of initiatives.
  * Our treasury diversification paid off! $150k USDC was bought over the last 2 weeks. We are now moving into ETH with the down market at parity. Our goal is approximately 50% GTC, 25% ETH, 25% stables (USDC/DAI/RAI)
  * We are modeling a non-transferrable governance token for FDD to start examining decision integrity in different models alongside our current processes during Q1 2021. These models will explore the effect of issuance, inflation, voice/conviction, and exit ability as measurements.
  * [Q4 2021 Budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-AYF28k2tyv0-eDhfqcLdqymCRcp6CdTsDgkflsAqMU/edit?usp=sharing) | Epoch 5 & 6 payments this weekend. FDD is pausing mandatory meetings from 12/21/21 until 1/8/22. Contributors know their Q4 deliverables and will be able to work async or take time off as needed.
* Sybil Detection
  * Monday the 20th at 3pm UTC (10am EST) - Join our massive, huge, incredible [Sybil Defense roadmap event](https://discord.com/events/562828676480237578/920072403655217252). This is the FDD contribution to the overall Grants Events schedule. Monday the 20th at 3pm UTC (10am EST) - Inviting relevant ecosystem guests
  * Three out of five rounds of human evaluations have been completed totaling almost 3k reviews. Our data science squad performed an analysis of results to help us better review in the future rounds.
  * We worked with Trueblocks as a contributor to FDD to create onchain data features for our ml algorithm. This will help the community data science group hit their Q4 deliverable of having one onchain feature in the ml pipeline.
  * Final run of Blockscience algo to be run Monday afternoon. This is the one that is currently used for addressing the sybil accounts.
  * Kevin published [The Gitcoin Anti-Sybil Flywheel](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-gitcoin-anti-sybil-flywheel/9417/2)
* Grant Eligibility
  * We made a new squad which aptly named itself the Grant Investigation Agency. Tasked with handling the grants disputes using Ethelo software, they talked to stakeholders to criteria for distributed adjudication of grants. This round we will run this process in parallel to the previous review squad model. A post round review will allow us to assign proper weighting to use the system to scale grant approvals and decrease turnaround time for GR13.
  * Grants created after Dec 10th will not be approved for this round. Our review squads are now working on the dispute backlog which can be seen at our public [Grants Disputes oversight page](https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/e79f1dd9e5074a1d986ee3f91b12943e?v=74372375b4ba42ebb269be219f2c452d). Feel free to comment directly on the page!
* Research
  * TE Governauts DAO Compensation Open Science Program had its halfway event. While GitcoinDAO is not a subject matter, 5 of the FDD researchers are participating in the study of DAO Compensation Models. [Event Video](https://youtu.be/wndDaI-eNgc)
  * Growth & Experimentation - This squad is looking at how to define squad/initiative health & creating a playbook for starting new streams & squads. Their Q4 deliverable will be to deliver 3 academic papers focused on the following topics:
    * Bottoms Up Approach to Building the Research Stream
    * Contributor Life Cycle Analysis
    * dReward & Decentralization Review
  * Risks & Threats - The study of defending Gitcoin from both sybil attacks and other attacks on Gitcoins legitimacy to produce 3 academic papers include:
    * Sybil Profiles Analysis
    * Gitcoin: Threats & Vulnerabilities
    * Threat Detection in GitcoinDAO

### :art: [Merch, Memes & Marketing](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Memes-Merch-Marketing-c1bd89fac8ab4569bf2a676df28025d8)

* An update to the [Steward Report Cards](https://www.daostewards.xyz/) is underway and scheduled for launch by the end of week. The update greatly improves the APIs that fetch the different metrics displayed. A version 2.0 of the cards with added metrics and features is currently being outlined in collaboration with Simona.

<li>Building the FDD Operating System to restructure and smooth out the governance process as FDD continues its push towards decentralization. A framework for ‚Äúminimal viable governance‚Äù is being worked on by core contributors. This includes councils rather than leads of initiatives.</li>
<li>Our treasury diversification paid off! $150k USDC was bought over the last 2 weeks. We are now moving into ETH with the down market at parity. Our goal is approximately 50% GTC, 25% ETH, 25% stables (USDC/DAI/RAI)</li>
<li>We are modeling a non-transferrable governance token for FDD to start examining decision integrity in different models alongside our current processes during Q1 2021. These models will explore the effect of issuance, inflation, voice/conviction, and exit ability as measurements.</li>

<li>Three out of five rounds of human evaluations have been completed totaling almost 3k reviews. Our data science squad performed an analysis of results to help us better review in the future rounds.</li>
<li>We worked with Trueblocks as a contributor to FDD to create onchain data features for our ml algorithm. This will help the community data science group hit their Q4 deliverable of having one onchain feature in the ml pipeline.</li>
<li>Final run of Blockscience algo to be run Monday afternoon. This is the one that is currently used for addressing the sybil accounts.</li>

<p>Grant Eligibility</p>
<ul>
<li>We made a new squad which aptly named itself the Grant Investigation Agency. Tasked with handling the grants disputes using Ethelo software, they talked to stakeholders to criteria for distributed adjudication of grants. This round we will run this process in parallel to the previous review squad model. A post round review will allow us to assign proper weighting to use the system to scale grant approvals and decrease turnaround time for GR13.</li>
<li>Grants created after Dec 10th will not be approved for this round. Our review squads are now working on the dispute backlog which can be seen at our public <a href="https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/e79f1dd9e5074a1d986ee3f91b12943e?v=74372375b4ba42ebb269be219f2c452d" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Grants Disputes oversight page</a>.

<li>Growth &amp; Experimentation - This squad is looking at how to define squad/initiative health &amp; creating a playbook for starting new streams &amp; squads. Their Q4 deliverable will be to deliver 3 academic papers focused on the following topics:
<ul>
<li>Bottoms Up Approach to Building the Research Stream</li>
<li>Contributor Life Cycle Analysis</li>
<li>dReward &amp; Decentralization Review</li>
