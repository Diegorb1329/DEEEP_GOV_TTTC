https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s15-proposal-integrated-dao-ops-budget-request/11221
    **Updated 8/8/2022:** The following proposal was edited to include Steward feedback, including formatting and language changes. The proposal was also edited to include additional OKRs for Community Experience and Community Governance. Additionally, one KR was removed from the Support initiative. 

# Essential Intent

During S15, DAO Operations will focus its initiatives on delivering results that support the following Essential Intents (EI) of the DAO:

* DAO Organization
* Financial Sustainability
* Protocol Adoption
* Program Success

# TL;DR

Over the last 2 seasons, DAO Ops’ ambitions were focused on building a service-oriented team with the right expertise to advise and support our fellow workstreams. On the whole, those efforts are producing results, especially in the areas of cross stream strategic planning, budgeting and decision making. One notable example of this is CSDO’s adoption of the DAO’s [Purpose and Essential Intents](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/update-gitcoindaos-adopted-purpose-and-essential-intents/10984/15), a leadership and community process that was facilitated by DAO Ops.

In S15, we have scaled back some initiatives and teams (i.e., accounting, people operations, and support) in an effort to reduce costs, and focus our attention on the DAO’s most important core functions and pivot to a protocol future. We see our overarching priorities as twofold:

1. Rebuild trust with workstreams by delivering results that are immediately helpful to them and the DAO as a whole, and
2. Building a habit of accountability throughout DAO Ops that facilitates focused delivery of initiative goals.

Though this season’s budget cuts were taken out of necessity, we recognize this season as an opportunity to focus our attention on service excellence in a few areas.

# Amount

**DAO Ops will not request new funds from the DAO treasury to fund our workstream in S15.** Instead, we will use the excess funds in our multisig to fund approximately $293K in total costs for the season. This total spend is 25% lower from the budget spent in S14, and 52% lower than the requested S14 budget. All surplus funds beyond our funding needs, representing roughly $270K USD, will be returned to the treasury.

*Note: The GTC total will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally. The vote will be to send the requested $USD amount in GTC at the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average, whichever is lower.*

**Funds Spent to Date (current and projected)**

During S14, DAO Ops spent an estimated $377K in S14. This estimate includes May and June actuals ($256K) and our projected spend for the month of July ($121K). We estimate roughly $750K USD is currently available to roll over into S15. This is in excess of our funding needed for the season.


**Misses, Direction Changes, and Lessons Learned**

In light of the broader market conditions, throughout S14, DAO Ops looked for ways to protect the DAO treasury from unnecessary spending. The result of those efforts was the addition of only one new hire instead of the three full-time hires projected at the beginning of the season. Some key learnings and changes in direction below:

* *Treasury Management Lead Hire:* In S14, DAO Ops opted to prioritize treasury efforts currently in our control over hiring a new Treasury Lead.

* *Hiring & Onboarding Flow:* We decided to put our onboarding efforts on hold while we evaluate and begin to define the impact we hope to make with the community onboarding experience (with other workstream partners). As a result, we did not onboard or track new community members through the existing onboarding flow. Our S15 community experience objectives are reflective of the time our team spent consulting our workstream partners to form a more inclusive and engaging community strategy.

* *Documented Accounting Guidance:* Due in part to legal considerations and to not run afoul of money transmitter laws, published financial guidance will be put on hold until a time where the DAO has fulsome legal recommendation from counsel on the topic.

[S15 Proposal - INTEGRATED] - DAO Ops Budget Request
linda

            <p>I’m supportive of this proposal after reviewing it at a high level and seeing the positive comments from stewards especially those who worked closely with the workstream on feedback. I’m also happy to see that DAO Ops is using excess funds for the budget and returning any surplus beyond this to the DAO treasury.</p>

            <p>After having a great conversation with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/jodi_gitcoindao">@Jodi_GitcoinDAO</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/krrisis">@krrisis</a>, I highly support and recommend to approve this budget. Adjustment will be made during S15 and I’ve already seen improvements in their re-organization. + They are not requesting any budget for this season which is amazing as they will plan their expanse from past seasons reserves.</p>
<p>Thank you for being transparent and all the clarification.</p>

            <p>I support this budget request and will be voting yes.</p>
<p>I know there have been a lot of hard decisions being made in scaling back to focus on the most critical items, and I very much appreciate the diligence &amp; thoughtfulness in all this work.</p>
<p>That said, I do want to call out one thing: I worry the S14 assessment is a bit rose-colored-glasses-y in that there is a lot of green, even in areas the workstream deemed worth scaling back for S15. From my perspective, these areas did struggle a bit to materialize and it was not totally clear to workstreams what DAO Ops would provide. vs. what would be sovereign to workstreams themselves.</p>
<p>As a WS lead, my hope for DAO Ops for S15 is that, in the areas of People Ops &amp; Tooling in particular, we can get super clear on what is being worked on centrally within DAO Ops in service to Workstreams, vs. what is up to Workstreams themselves to manage &amp; bring back best practices to the rest of the DAO. We still feel in kind of in-between territory for both of these.</p>

<p>We do not have anything officially in our commitments on role documentation, as this was not indicated as a priority for this season.

The tl;dr on Sobol is that this is probably a too ambitious tool for the basic things we need, and given our limited budget and scaled down team, we will also scale down this project.</p>

</aside>
<p>Thanks for this feedback. We still have some people ops tasks unified under DAO Ops but have minimized this because feedback from CSDO was that we should limit our efforts (less policies, more listening) and so for now we’ve decided to scale back, and listen. For accounting the cost per workstream should be fairly limited, and keeping this within the workstreams allows for more control and overview on who’s actually requesting payment for what, because the payment controller knows exactly what the team is working on. But also here, we stay open to increase our efforts again in the future if needed.</p>

<p>There is no strong reason for this. We saw other workstream leads add travel expenses under reserves, and on my question on where to put potential severance fees and parental leave the use of reserves was also suggested. Because no work will really be done during this period by the contributor it made sense to add this to reserves for us.</p>

lefterisjp

            <p>I am posting here mostly for technical reasons to hit the number of stewards required to take this to a vote.</p>
<p>But did read the proposal a bit and I really like seeing this</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DAO Ops will not request new funds from the DAO treasury to fund our workstream in S15.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also one question. you mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Onboarded Moonshot and PGF to budget and payment tools to support DAO-wide spend reporting.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>But unless I misunderstand PGF still has their own accounting budget.</p>
<p>For accounting and HR (People Ops?) it would be nice to have a unified budget across the DAO.</p>

            <p>I’m supporting this budget as the workstream is sending money back to the treasury. I have some concerns around this workstream that I would like to see addressed before S16 around the discussion of duplicative efforts with PGF Grassroots and MMM community engagement. I’d also want to see an improved milestone report with more strong efforts for executing on deliverables. The new metrics are well crafted and give me confidence that their focus will lead to better results this season.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>KR1: Increase average weekly engagement on the DAO Citizens channels by 20%.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/jodi_gitcoindao">@Jodi_GitcoinDAO</a> I’m a bit late to the party, but I believe this KPI would be more impactful if we shifted the focus. <strong>Instead of aiming to increase average weekly engagement by 20%, what if we aimed to increase the <em>percentage</em> of engagement seen by <em>all citizens</em> by 20%?</strong></p>
<p>To explain through examples (using hypothetical numbers), if we start with a current population size of 100 and an average of ten weekly engaged citizens (giving us a current engagement metric of 10%):</p>
<p><strong>Currently</strong> we are aiming for a 20% increase in average weekly engagement, which is a metric that doesn’t account for population growth. If we have 100 citizens and ten are engaged, we aim to have 12 engaged citizens by the end of S15 regardless of how large our citizen population grows (a 20% increase on 10 gets us 12). Getting two more engaged citizens if we double our overall population is easy to achieve and would ultimately reflect a <em>decrease</em> in engagement (down to 6%)</p>
<p><strong>I’m proposing we shift</strong> this KPI to “Increase the average weekly percentage of engaged citizens on the DAO Citizens channels by 20%.” With this, we can account for the growth of our community in addition to these specific engagement metrics. If our population size stays at 100, our end goal similarly stays at 12 engaged citizens. However, if our population size doubles, our new target will double to match. In a population size of 200, instead of aiming for 12 engaged citizens, we would now aim for 24 engaged citizens, providing that 12% engagement metric increase (up 20% from the hypothetical 10%).</p>
<p>To clarify definitions, we would consider the “overall population” as the <strong>target audience</strong> for the DAO Citizens channels / DAO vibes calls (which would be anyone with either the DAO Citizen or DAO Core role, as aligned with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/safder">@safder</a>)</p>
<p>The goal here is to ensure we scale our ambitions for engagement growth proportionally with our efforts to continue increasing the overall size of our community! I would love to hear other folk’s thoughts.</p>

            <p>I really appreciate the thoughtful approach to narrowing down to what matters most - and specifically how we will be focusing on supporting our Essential Intents.</p>
<p>I am supportive of the budget as proposed and I am interested to see what can still be accomplished in the areas where cuts were made.</p>
<p>This feels like the season that Support needs to shine. It has been a stumbling block for a couple seasons now. The focus on the KB is a great option. I don’t think hiring more people to support the platform and eventually protocol are what success looks like. Empowering the community to help support and fortified those folks with clear docs and support resources could go a long way.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/lunacat">@Lunacat</a> your question doesn’t read facetiously at all. I’d say though we generally delivered on our objectives, I think that in some cases, there was a misalignment in our approach to achieving them. And since the ends don’t justify the means, that overarching priority really comes down to delivering on the specific needs of workstreams and the DAO’s Essential Intent.</p>

            <p>Great to see the very first $0 request budget wise and money returning to the treasury! I am supportive of this level of awareness and mindfulness in expenditure. I also like the feedback integration and further clarifications on focus and priorities. It makes me extremely hopeful that S16 will be even better calibrated</p>

<p>We agree with you that this is a bit vague and are considering to even take this out in our integrated proposal (going up on Monday), and integrate shared commitments in the various places, knowing that anything our workstream does is basically shared, as we facilitate all operational processes within the dao. This one specifically belongs under support, where it actually already is mentioned:</p>

<p>This is a great suggestion, and we’ve been thinking in this direction.<br>
We’ve done this exercise internally for this round during the budget preparation, while doing a peer evaluation. We did not count the people but we did know which part of the ‘pie’ we are representing, at least for these drafts.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of this, this is the current split. Only reason we did not share is because of time lack, so thx so much for asking.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the very clear write-up and for your work in improving overall DAO operations.</p>
<p>I was a little confused by the wording of the second Shared Cross Stream Commitment: " * Developing Gitcoin’s knowledge base with and evolving the support process to prepare for our protocol future with help from GPC."</p>
<p>As I understand it, this is preparing to support partners and other users of Grants 2.0 and passport for eg - by collaborating w/ GPC?</p>
<p>That one seems to me to both be really important and a bit vague as stated here so far.</p>
<p>One idea - not living in the streams here - would be to have processes set up that checklist releases from GPC (soft or hard gate) to ensure KB articles are updated for example.  Or is that sort of thing already happening?</p>
<p>One meta piece of feedback for all of the write-ups is each summary could add at the beginning a context statement such as a bullet point or two:</p>
<ul>
<li>DAO Ops = X people out of Y people in total across Gitcoin DAO; $X spending out of $Y spending in total across Gitcoin DAO.</li>
</ul>
<p>Really clear write up and incredible the amount of work you and team are doing IMO.</p>

</aside>
<p>5- 1/4 of 80 contributor is 20, are you budgeting 2k each? This amount would be then 40k?</p>

[S15 Proposal - INTEGRATED] - DAO Ops Budget Request
Jodi_GitcoinDAO

            <p><strong>Updated 8/8/2022:</strong> The following proposal was edited to include Steward feedback, including formatting and language changes. The proposal was also edited to include additional OKRs for Community Experience and Community Governance. Additionally, one KR was removed from the Support initiative.</p>
<h1>
<a name="essential-intent-1" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#essential-intent-1"></a>Essential Intent</h1>
<p>During S15, DAO Operations will focus its initiatives on delivering results that support the following Essential Intents (EI) of the DAO:</p>
<ul>
<li>DAO Organization</li>
<li>Financial Sustainability</li>
<li>Protocol Adoption</li>
<li>Program Success</li>
</ul>
<h1>
<a name="tldr-2" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#tldr-2"></a>TL;DR</h1>
<p>Over the last 2 seasons, DAO Ops’ ambitions were focused on building a service-oriented team with the right expertise to advise and support our fellow workstreams. On the whole, those efforts are producing results, especially in the areas of cross stream strategic planning, budgeting and decision making. One notable example of this is CSDO’s adoption of the DAO’s <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/update-gitcoindaos-adopted-purpose-and-essential-intents/10984/15">Purpose and Essential Intents</a>, a leadership and community process that was facilitated by DAO Ops.</p>
<p>In S15, we have scaled back some initiatives and teams (i.e., accounting, people operations, and support) in an effort to reduce costs, and focus our attention on the DAO’s most important core functions and pivot to a protocol future. We see our overarching priorities as twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rebuild trust with workstreams by delivering results that are immediately helpful to them and the DAO as a whole, and</li>
<li>Building a habit of accountability throughout DAO Ops that facilitates focused delivery of initiative goals.</li>
</ol>
<p>Though this season’s budget cuts were taken out of necessity, we recognize this season as an opportunity to focus our attention on service excellence in a few areas.</p>
<h1>
<a name="amount-3" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#amount-3"></a>Amount</h1>
<p><strong>DAO Ops will not request new funds from the DAO treasury to fund our workstream in S15.</strong> Instead, we will use the excess funds in our multisig to fund approximately $293K in total costs for the season. This total spend is 25% lower from the budget spent in S14, and 52% lower than the requested S14 budget. All surplus funds beyond our funding needs, representing roughly $270K USD, will be returned to the treasury.</p>
<p><em>Note: The GTC total will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally. The vote will be to send the requested $USD amount in GTC at the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average, whichever is lower.</em></p>

</div><p><strong>Funds Spent to Date (current and projected)</strong></p>
<p>During S14, DAO Ops spent an estimated $377K in S14. This estimate includes May and June actuals ($256K) and our projected spend for the month of July ($121K). We estimate roughly $750K USD is currently available to roll over into S15. This is in excess of our funding needed for the season.</p>
<p><strong>Misses, Direction Changes, and Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<p>In light of the broader market conditions, throughout S14, DAO Ops looked for ways to protect the DAO treasury from unnecessary spending. The result of those efforts was the addition of only one new hire instead of the three full-time hires projected at the beginning of the season. Some key learnings and changes in direction below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Treasury Management Lead Hire:</em> In S14, DAO Ops opted to prioritize treasury efforts currently in our control over hiring a new Treasury Lead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Hiring &amp; Onboarding Flow:</em> We decided to put our onboarding efforts on hold while we evaluate and begin to define the impact we hope to make with the community onboarding experience (with other workstream partners). As a result, we did not onboard or track new community members through the existing onboarding flow. Our S15 community experience objectives are reflective of the time our team spent consulting our workstream partners to form a more inclusive and engaging community strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Documented Accounting Guidance:</em> Due in part to legal considerations and to not run afoul of money transmitter laws, published financial guidance will be put on hold until a time where the DAO has fulsome legal recommendation from counsel on the topic.</p>
</li>
