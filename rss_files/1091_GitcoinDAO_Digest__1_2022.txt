Funds will be dispersed across 3 key areas: grassroots community efforts, grants operations, and community partnerships. [More details here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-public-goods-are-good-pgf-q1-budget-request/9416).

  * Planning work necessary to enable other teams/entities to run their own Grant Rounds using the dGrants Explorer
  * Planning for creation of dGrantsjs library
  * Planning for finalization of dGrants Protocol V1
  * Tightening scope to enable focus on priorities

* Payouts for GR12 are nearly complete! For those who have yet to receive payouts, you can expect to receive it this week.

* We‚Äôve also deployed a [wiki page ](https://wiki.dgitcoin.co/)for the dGitcoin team to organize documents and projects.

* For DevOps we‚Äôve been creating a request portal to make it easier to request DevOps type changes. We‚Äôve implemented DNS configuration changes for the DAO, and we will be working with FDD to understand DevOps related needs better.

* Operations
  * We‚Äôve just concluded our Q1 Strategy & Deliverables Workshop for Operations and Sybil Defense, two more are coming in the next days for Grant Eligibility and Research!
  * We‚Äôre also rebooting the FDD Operating System for Q1, to incorporate a flat organizational structure, an updated compensation model, and a cadence for meetings and planning.

* Sybil Defense
  * In the meantime, we‚Äôre working on requirements for participation from a sybil data federation to share data in a community data lake anonymized for ML-modeling. Community algo will also have its first run this month!
  * Feel free to also check out the [Blockscience review of GR12](https://medium.com/block-science/gitcoin-grants-round-12-evaluation-results-bf01fe4c9641).

* Grant Eligibility
  * The Grant approval time will now start 30 days prior to each round and end 7 days into the round. This allows for better training and more time for disputes to be resolved.
  * We will begin using the GIA ethelo model to build an integration for the grant approvals squad.
  * Policy maintenance moving to the newly approved Gitbook knowledge base.

* Research
  * Some deliverables that we‚Äôre still working on from Q4 2021 include:
    * Data analysis of human evaluations for ML-pipeline to gain insights on the inter-reviewer variations to improve training for reviewers.
    * Documentation of the bottoms-up stream building experiment and the process for building bottom-up governance for streams.
    * Actionable insights from the Token Engineering Academy DAO Rewards Policy research program for GitcoinDAO.
    * Top 10 sybil profiles research giving insights to human evaluators & the feature engineers to improve their work.

<p>We‚Äôre in the midst of planning for 2022 and we‚Äôre aiming to have a roadmap for the year ahead completed by the end of January. Initiatives in the works include:</p>

<p>We‚Äôve also deployed a <a href="https://wiki.dgitcoin.co/">wiki page </a>for the dGitcoin team to organize documents and projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For DevOps we‚Äôve been creating a request portal to make it easier to request DevOps type changes. We‚Äôve implemented DNS configuration changes for the DAO, and we will be working with FDD to understand DevOps related needs better.</p>

<p>Sybil Defense</p>
