https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-suggestion-i-need-a-better-name-for-this/972
    One common thread that I see in all of Gitcoin's initiatives is a dedication to trying to rally around and create positive-sum games. The original bounties platform sought to create win-win situations between those who needed work and those who wanted to supply it, reducing coordination costs and enhancing ecosystem efficiency. Grants seeks to make giving funds fun, and create a positive-sum game around funding the ecosystem. KERNEL looks at educating from a holistic perspective, and seeks to train people to think positive-sum.

I'd like to suggest a workstream dedicated to discovering positive-sum loops in the wider ecosystem and trying to implement them. We're watching more zero-sum games creep in, imho, especially as the financial applications bloom. Traditional finance is often fond of zero-sum games, and if we want to try to keep the positive-sum ecosystem, we should be looking for every vector we could make it happen in.

I see this as primarily being a working group and task force. A working group to think of and research new ideas, and a task force that can go make it happen.

As a member of the Ethereum Cat Herders, I see this as being very much in line with our ethos of decentralized ecosystem coordination, and would be very happy to try to coordinate collaboration.

            <p>Quite new to all of this as well, but eagerly learning - with a background more in the Humanities I think a philosophically, or perhaps epistemologically, -inclined group would do gitcoin, and blockchain at large, a lot of good.</p>
<p>Perhaps just monthly reports or something that can cut past the investing/currency/liquidity connotation of blockchain, and instead illustrate how small projects  create the tangible steps towards a future that could benefit from such technologies in a pretty straight-forward manner - am I understanding your idea here at least somewhat correctly <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/wschwab">@wschwab</a> ?  If not, perhaps I will propose this group, or some diminutive rendition of something similar, as a separate proposal if that is OK with you.</p>

This suggestion is more like infinite game rather than zero-sum game.<br>
Finally Gitcoin would be an infinite game, including supporting public goods etc.</p>

<p>I think you‚Äôre in the right place. Just to be clear, this is just a suggestion, nothing is figured out yet. Right now I‚Äôm kinda waiting on a Public Good workgroup call/meeting/powwow/thing being arranged, and figure we‚Äôll try to figure out more details there. Research is super important for something like this! I think it‚Äôll be great to have you onboard.</p>

<p>There isn‚Äôt anything worked out right now for any salaries, nor would I expect there to be anytime soon.

            <p>This is something <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/austingriffith">@austingriffith</a> posted on Twitter, but perhaps there is a way to introduce a staking mechanism that puts a small amount into funding public goods (1-5%), then allocates funds to different LPs to maximize gains.</p>
<p>I know you mentioned these could be different from public goods funding, (which I support!), this public good tilt may just be an easy place to start.</p>
<p>Creating positive sum incentives more broadly is something we would love to support.</p>

            <p>My original thoughts were of a kind of think-tank/task force. Does that fit in to your track? By the name, I thought they might need to be separate - the idea I‚Äôm thinking of isn‚Äôt about funding necessarily. Maybe I‚Äôll give one example that‚Äôs been weighing on me for a while.</p>
<p>While I‚Äôm hesitant to name names, I think they are necessary for the following. I think it‚Äôs clear that Uniswap and Sushi view attracting liquidity as something approaching a zero-sum game at this point. There have certainly been a bunch of salty memes between the two camps. If we posit that zero-sum behavior is less productive for the ecosystem than positive-sum, the next step would be to think of how to flip attracting liquidity into an overtly positive-sum game. The first thought (at least for me) was that if it was possible to create a layer in between the two (and whomever, so long as security can be assured) which allowed Sushi to benefit from Uni‚Äôs liquidity and vice versa, then each would be <em>interested</em> in the other platform accruing liquidity, since their own boat is also moved up with the rising tide.</p>
<p>I have no idea how that would be possible. It might be impossible. It‚Äôs an example of something that a group could research, coordinate, and implement (if it is possible). It might even be able to be permissionless. There‚Äôs nothing about funding goods in there, though, I think this might be more like ‚Äúkeeping public goods good or making them gooder‚Äù if I can riff off of <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a> 's frequent line.</p>
<p>That being said, if you think the best way forward is a merge, I‚Äôm all for it. I just wanted to be clear about what I‚Äôm talking about.</p>
<p>And nice to see you too <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/yalor">@Yalor</a> ! Looking forward.</p>
