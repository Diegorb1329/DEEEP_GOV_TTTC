            <p>Interesting idea. I would love for a community for Arabic speakers.</p>
<p>I agree with <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/wschwab">@wschwab</a> that translation tools are not developed enough. I think if you do not divide based on language, it will kind of be chaotic. I like the idea of language communities with ambassadors that can speak multiple languages.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply. Yes, I agree that only language tools can not make an over 60% correct/comfortable conversation. Maybe language tools plus an ‚Äúambassadors‚Äù could be a good  solution now. An ‚Äúambassadors‚Äù could help the conversation when people cannot help each other totally.</p>

            <p>I think having a conversation about how to maximize the ability for non-English speakers to participate is a great idea. I personally feel like translation tools are not yet at the point where they allow two people without a common language to comfortably converse, especially if the languages are very different (eg Chinese and English), but do not have definitive knowledge on the subject.</p>
<p>Do you think have separate language communities with ‚Äúambassadors‚Äù that can speak multiple languages bridging the gap makes for a more comfortable experience, or using tools, even if the translation can be less than 100%?</p>
