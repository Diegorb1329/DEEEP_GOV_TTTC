https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-s22-gitcoin-passport-business-unit-budget-proposal/18731
    <h1>S22 - Gitcoin Passport Business Unit Budget Proposal </h1>


This seeks funding for the Gitcoin Passport Business Unit for the next 2 months (May 1st - June 30th). Starting July 1st we’ll move from the Seasons concept (made to align previously with Gitcoin Grants rounds) to traditional quarters (Q3 & Q4) and request a budget for the 2nd half of the year, as needed, depending on the spinout. We want and encourage broader DAO feedback and find it crucial to optimize our roadmap.


<h2>TL;DR</h2>


Gitcoin Passport aims to be the go-to solution for web3 identity and reputation management. In the next partial season we’ll concentrate on five key pillars:

1. **Ease:** Improve ease of use for both end users and partners
2. **Effectiveness:** Improve identity scoring models 
3. **Adoption:** Grow to 1.5M passports
4. **GTC Utility**: Strengthen GTC-based identity and community ties
5. **Partnerships:** Increase both API and onchain partnerships

<h2>Outline</h2>


Passport is the premier web3 native offering that enables ecosystems to protect, understand and organically grow what matters most – their communities. We see Passport at the confluence of a best in class identity solution, backed by the most relevant and comprehensive data analysis toolset that also offers communities the ability to ascribe reputation.

Objectives for Seasons 22: This table lists the milestones and deliverables we plan to tackle. While they are in a loose priority order, their final sequencing is still under evaluation.

<h2>Milestone Update: Season 21</h2>


In Season 21, our top line growth picked up quite a bit adding 279k new Passports or 35% total growth in the last 3 months. We continued to underperform against aggressive targets, but excited to see the growth as the markets are becoming more bullish. We have a total of 1.1M unique all time passports. We also continued to drive strongly against our targets in GTC staking, hitting over 1.5M GTC staked.

We’ve continued to expand our potential service offerings beyond the standard Passport & onchain Passports to include our new Model Based Detection (MBD) system that is now in beta with the Eth activity model. This is proving to be highly effective at classifying Sybils (94% accurate) and enables scoring of addresses without requiring any user interaction. The Ethereum Activity model is the first model with additional models to be added to the MBD endpoint soon. Additions will include: NFT (Eth L1), zkSync (L2), OP (L2) and Polygon (L2) with more in the pipeline.

</table>


**Observations:**

* While we fell short again on passport adoption against very aggressive targets of doubling every 6 months. We’re continuing to drive a pipeline for new integration partners to continue growth.
* We’ve found success in both GTC staking and onchain revenue starting to drive the flywheel for both utility and sustainability. The upcoming revamp of identity staking, from smart contracts to UI, should continue to grow the utility of GTC. This was delayed several months from our original go-live estimates as we focused on supporting key partners.

For more granular details on our past work and plans, please refer to our previous budgets for [S17](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s17-proposal-integrated-gitcoin-passport-budget-request/12727), [S18 & S19](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gitcoin-passport-workstream-season-18-19-budget-request/14121), [S19 (Amended)](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s19-proposal-amended-passport-s19-budget-request/16184), [S20 & S21](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-passport-season-20-21-budget-request/16765), and also our updated [Passport Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/gitcoinco/projects/25/views/1).

<h2>Budget Update: Season Next (May & June) </h2>


We are increasing the budget for this season as part of the move to the BU concept; adding 3 additional headcount accounting for resources who were previously shared or part time. The additional budget includes hiring a Sr. Product Marketing Manager (still in progress), moving from part time to full time Operations, adding an additional BD resource dedicated to support growth, and adding Kyle to the team!

**Team Composition**

**Full-Time Contributors:** 15 (after hiring the two described above)

* Developers: 4
* Product Manager: 1
* Data Scientists: 2
* Business Unit Co-leads: 2 (Kyle moving in)
* Operations: 1
* Marketing: 1
* Support: 2 
* Design: 1 (previously part time, moving to full time role dedicated to Passport)
* BD: 1 (previously cost for BD was out of PGF which is now Grants Labs, moving to fully dedicated to Passport)

**Part-Time or Shared Contributors:** 5

* DevRel: 2
* DevOps: 1
* Operations: 1

<h2>Funding Request for Seasons S22</h2>


**Requested Amount:** Gitcoin Passport is requesting a net allocation of 0 GTC*, equivalent to approximately $0 out of treasury to cover this season. We have plenty of funds in our reserves, in part due to the Eth revenue from onchain Passports, to cover all funds needed for this shortened season of 2 months.

</aside>
<p>Yep definitely something I’m interested as well. The next step is to see what happens to revenue when we add additional chains likely 1-2 more will be added in the next month. I think we can also play with decoupling a full passport onchain with a single attestation (e.g. 1 stamp) and price it much cheaper ($0.25) to see if that actually results in a lot more attestations and therefore revenue. What else did you have in mind?</p>

[Proposal]S22 - Gitcoin Passport Business Unit Budget Proposal

            <h1>S22 - Gitcoin Passport Business Unit Budget Proposal </h1>
<p>This seeks funding for the Gitcoin Passport Business Unit for the next 2 months (May 1st - June 30th). Starting July 1st we’ll move from the Seasons concept (made to align previously with Gitcoin Grants rounds) to traditional quarters (Q3 &amp; Q4) and request a budget for the 2nd half of the year, as needed, depending on the spinout. We want and encourage broader DAO feedback and find it crucial to optimize our roadmap.</p>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Gitcoin Passport aims to be the go-to solution for web3 identity and reputation management. In the next partial season we’ll concentrate on five key pillars:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ease:</strong> Improve ease of use for both end users and partners</li>
<li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Improve identity scoring models</li>

<p><strong>Observations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While we fell short again on passport adoption against very aggressive targets of doubling every 6 months. We’re continuing to drive a pipeline for new integration partners to continue growth.</li>
<li>We’ve found success in both GTC staking and onchain revenue starting to drive the flywheel for both utility and sustainability. The upcoming revamp of identity staking, from smart contracts to UI, should continue to grow the utility of GTC. This was delayed several months from our original go-live estimates as we focused on supporting key partners.</li>

<h2>Budget Update: Season Next (May &amp; June) </h2>
<p>We are increasing the budget for this season as part of the move to the BU concept; adding 3 additional headcount accounting for resources who were previously shared or part time. The additional budget includes hiring a Sr. Product Marketing Manager (still in progress), moving from part time to full time Operations, adding an additional BD resource dedicated to support growth, and adding Kyle to the team!</p>
<p><strong>Team Composition</strong></p>
<p><strong>Full-Time Contributors:</strong> 15 (after hiring the two described above)</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers: 4</li>
<li>Product Manager: 1</li>
<li>Data Scientists: 2</li>
<li>Business Unit Co-leads: 2 (Kyle moving in)</li>
<li>Operations: 1</li>
<li>Marketing: 1</li>
<li>Support: 2</li>
<li>Design: 1 (previously part time, moving to full time role dedicated to Passport)</li>
<li>BD: 1 (previously cost for BD was out of PGF which is now Grants Labs, moving to fully dedicated to Passport)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Part-Time or Shared Contributors:</strong> 5</p>
<ul>
<li>DevRel: 2</li>
<li>DevOps: 1</li>
<li>Operations: 1</li>
</ul>
<h2>Funding Request for Seasons S22</h2>
<p><strong>Requested Amount:</strong> Gitcoin Passport is requesting a net allocation of 0 GTC*, equivalent to approximately $0 out of treasury to cover this season. We have plenty of funds in our reserves, in part due to the Eth revenue from onchain Passports, to cover all funds needed for this shortened season of 2 months.</p>
