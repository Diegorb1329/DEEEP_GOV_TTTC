* @owocki authored a thread titled [How might we Decentralize Gitcoin?](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-might-we-decentralize-gitcoin/8734) The post lays out ‚Äúa high level view of how we might decentralize Gitcoin from a platform into a series of protocols. This post contains much of the same information as my recent[ Edcon talk Decentralizing Gitcoin Grants 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucaA3sh3SRA).‚Äù

* A thread on [Stewards Voting Power over time](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/stewards-voting-power-over-time/8735) was created by @owocki to to track how voting power of the stewards evolve over time. The code used can be found [here](https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/pull/9380/).

* The discussion on [Gitcoin Grants Side Rounds](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-side-rounds/8660/) received input from @linda and @David_Dyor with feedback regarding the benefits and potential risks.

* RFP initial winners and honorary mentions have almost finished providing their abstracts for the announcement!

[Public Goods Prototyping (Moonshot Collective)](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-public-goods-prototyping/130)

* Memepalooza2 was hosted by the workstream last Friday in the Discord. Over 50 people joined and created over 100 memes on the topic for public goods, the open internet and the values of GitcoinDAO. We had a live DJ playing tunes and we tested out coordination tools from Moonshot collective; [tip.party](https://tip.party/) and [Quadratic Diplomacy](https://www.quadraticdiplomacy.com/).

* @fred gave a presentation and shared details on the [Steward Report Cards](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-steward-report-cards/8712) project during a demo event hosted by Moonshot Collective. A video recording of the presentation will be uploaded to Moonshot Collectives Youtube page.
