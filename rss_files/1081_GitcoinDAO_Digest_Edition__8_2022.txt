* Moonshot Collective builds tools for DAOs so they may recognize and reward their contributors. We‚Äôre excited to announce the launch of our first major DAO tool, [Tip.Party](https://tip.party/)! Quickly reward event and meeting participants all at once with tokens. It‚Äôs simple and ready to use! Want a walkthrough? [DM us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MoonshotCollect).

## üíô [Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Fraud-Detection-Defense-2bde13c0b8e74fda81435d94e49e2703)

* **Sybil Defense**
  * The Anti-Sybil Operational Process is ready to hand off from Blockscience to GitcoinDAO. After 3 workshops to transfer knowledge, the DAO devops group is ready to run the main system which activates sanctions against sybil accounts.

  * The trust bonus evaluation shows how few of the accounts currently use any of the trust bonus methods. We still feel we can make recommendations for how the weighting of each integration should be updated to more accurately reflect their intended purpose.

    ![|168x250](upload://vmma7rK3fUMXdV6H7NaSlPIRcf9.gif)

* **Grants Investigation Agency**
  * We received legal approval from the Gitcoin Holdings org for our integration for the Ethelo tool built out to scale our ability to review grants as a community. While we still may use it for the last week of open approvals, we plan to use it again for the flags & disputes later in GR13.

  * In working with the Ethelo platform, we learned that its design is generalizable to many other uses including our human evaluators in the ML pipeline. It could even be used to review user participation, task creation, task completion, community sentiment among other use cases. We hope to advance discussions on building a lasting partnership with the Ethelo team.

  * Last day for new grant approvals is Wednesday, March 15th! Get your grants in today! (Shout out to [Zer8](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/zer8/summary), [David](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/David_Dyor), and the grants review squads for staying on top of the incoming approvals!)
* **Ground Control**
  * [Adam Stallard](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/castall/summary) of BrightID will be joining our multisig to replace Trueblocks who is stepping out of that role and leaning into being a subject matter expert helping our community ML model build out on-chain features for sybil detection. Thanks for your support and oversight [TJ](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/tjayrush)!

  * We hosted a workshop with our multisig keyholders on how to improve the experience and quality of their participation this week.

  * Check out the new and improved [FDD notion main page](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Fraud-Detection-Defense-2bde13c0b8e74fda81435d94e49e2703) & FDD proposals template!

  * Our data analytics squad is looking for requests. As we and others write code to analyze grants and DAO data, we are looking to aggregate and create dashboards to give the best of the best insights to our community on an ongoing basis.

  * Shout out to MMM stream for some new cool logo designs

An introduction will be held this Friday before the process begins next week.

* A new topic has been posted on the forum to discuss [Gitcoin Visual Identity & Branding](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-gitcoin-visual-identity-branding/10023).

<p><strong>Sybil Defense</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Anti-Sybil Operational Process is ready to hand off from Blockscience to GitcoinDAO. After 3 workshops to transfer knowledge, the DAO devops group is ready to run the main system which activates sanctions against sybil accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trust bonus evaluation shows how few of the accounts currently use any of the trust bonus methods. We still feel we can make recommendations for how the weighting of each integration should be updated to more accurately reflect their intended purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Grants Investigation Agency</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We received legal approval from the Gitcoin Holdings org for our integration for the Ethelo tool built out to scale our ability to review grants as a community. While we still may use it for the last week of open approvals, we plan to use it again for the flags &amp; disputes later in GR13.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In working with the Ethelo platform, we learned that its design is generalizable to many other uses including our human evaluators in the ML pipeline. It could even be used to review user participation, task creation, task completion, community sentiment among other use cases. We hope to advance discussions on building a lasting partnership with the Ethelo team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last day for new grant approvals is Wednesday, March 15th! Get your grants in today! (Shout out to <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/zer8/summary">Zer8</a>, <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/David_Dyor">David</a>, and the grants review squads for staying on top of the incoming approvals!)</p>

<p><a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/castall/summary">Adam Stallard</a> of BrightID will be joining our multisig to replace Trueblocks who is stepping out of that role and leaning into being a subject matter expert helping our community ML model build out on-chain features for sybil detection. Thanks for your support and oversight <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/tjayrush">TJ</a>!</p>
