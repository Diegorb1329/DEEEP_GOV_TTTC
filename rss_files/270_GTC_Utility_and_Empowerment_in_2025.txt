GTC Utility and Empowerment in 2025
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gtc-utility-and-empowerment-in-2025/19901
    2024 was a transformative year for Gitcoin. Together, we accomplished: 



* $10M+ GMV
* Nearly $1M in revenue
* A transition into service models, product spinouts (Hello, Passport!), and embracing a multi-mechanism future for our grants program.

The passion and commitment of our community and contributors drove these successes. Momentum is everything in web3 - time to push harder. 

As we kick off 2025, we‚Äôre picking back up a crucial piece of the convo that we know is already happening, has happened and hasn‚Äôt been delivered on - **GTC must evolve beyond governance to deliver real value across our ecosystem.**

GTC isn‚Äôt a speculative asset. It‚Äôs a token designed to empower communities, amplify impact, and create sustainable funding for public goods. Just as we look to the community to be missionaries, not mercenaries, we must build meaningful utility for our token.


## The Role of GTC: Evolving Beyond Governance

GTC launched as a governance token to empower the Gitcoin community to decide how funding is allocated for public goods. This foundational role remains critical. But we‚Äôre ready to take it further.

Our vision for GTC centers on three core functions:



* Empowers Trust: Enables holders to signal legitimacy and amplify impactful projects, creating a web of trust that strengthens our entire ecosystem.
* Incentivizes Participation: Rewards contributions that align with Gitcoin‚Äôs mission and values driving our mission forward. 
* Sustains Impact: Creates regenerative systems where value flows back into funding public goods.

We‚Äôve spent too long discussing GTC utility without enough action. It‚Äôs time for the token to work as hard as our community.


## Building GTC Utility That Matters

While GTC has been useful in our governance framework, we are actively working towards expanding its utility to provide value to our community alongside the work with our partners in ways that MAKE.SENSE. 

These initiatives are being explored (more below), and we are excited to share more details soon. In the interim, we encourage our community to propose battle-tested mechanisms that our product team and organization can implement. You'll find many exciting discussions already happening on our forum - dive in and explore previous suggestions below.

We encourage you to reach out for more details as we flesh out our research. Our goal is to make GTC not just a governance tool but also a valuable asset that supports various aspects of our ecosystem.

We are focused on mechanisms that align with our mission to fund impactful projects while fostering trust and sustainability. Here‚Äôs how we considering building utility - starting w/ product and then expanding back into our first principles approach at ramping up our community and governance:



* **Trust-Weighted Curation** that allow holders to signal legitimacy for impactful projects, amplifying their visibility and funding potential.
* ***Dynamic Incentivization*** by tying rewards to measurable contributions, GTC will incentivize meaningful participation across our ecosystem wherever we can. 
* ***Regenerative Feedback Loops*** by creating systems where good work ‚Üí more visibility ‚Üí more funding ‚Üí even more good work, reinforcing the value of public goods.
* ***Revenue Routing*** by exploring systems to align incentives and ensure sustainable funding for Gitcoin‚Äôs mission including but not limited to buyback and other routes like the treasury diversification(s)

We‚Äôre exploring and evaluating mechanisms that represent our commitment to fostering trust, participation, and innovation within Gitcoin.


## Grants Lab: Leading the Charge in Gitcoin‚Äôs Q1

Over the past few years, we've launched multiple initiatives to enhance GTC utility. While many faced adoption challenges, each attempt taught us valuable lessons about what our ecosystem needs.

Recognizing the need for a more structured and impactful approach, Grants Lab is stepping forward in Q1 to spearhead some GTC utility experiments. Building upon previous learnings, the Grants Lab team is working on validation of practical solutions that effectively integrate GTC utility into our products and services. This initiative reflects our commitment to transitioning from theoretical discussions to actionable implementations, ensuring that GTC serves as a valuable asset within the Gitcoin ecosystem.

Some of the previously discussed initiatives highlighted below and you can find more in the references:

* Curation Tools: Enable GTC holders to elevate impactful projects during rounds.
* Staking Models: Pilot GTC staking to enhance Sybil resistance and incentivize trustworthiness.
* Dynamic Reward Mechanisms: Reward contributors who demonstrate long-term alignment with Gitcoin‚Äôs values.




### Let‚Äôs Git to Werk

2025 is our opportunity to make GTC more than a governance token. Together, we‚Äôll evolve its utility to power a stronger, more sustainable future for public goods.

ICYMI Gitcoin remains dedicated to empowering communities to build and fund what matters. GTC is the token that binds us together, evolving from a governance token to an incredible future. These enhancements are designed to ensure financial sustainability, foster community engagement, and amplify the impact of public goods. :black_heart:

GTC Utility and Empowerment in 2025

            <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>SimScore has been selected to Demo our prioritization tool on Feb 11 at 2 utc.  <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/daeyunique">@DaeYunique</a> and I are troubleshooting some Discord issues, so hopefully that will be worked out by then.</p>
<p>Our purpose is to reduce <strong>Overwhelm</strong> in organizations.  DAOs are often structured in a way that <strong>Overwhelm</strong> is inevitable.  SimScore makes life easier by determining a consensus priority list.</p>
<p><strong>‚Äúhttps://       rndadocs.notion.site/Gitcoin-Demo-GTC-utility-and-Empowerment-in-2025-to-date-feb-8-194786e93779801b9f11dee0b5e34680?pvs=4‚Äù</strong><br>
<strong>(Being a new user - cannot add links yet)</strong></p>
<p>Top 1 - <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/recce">@Recce</a> ‚ÄúGood to see a discussion on this subject - better late than never.While I am an avid supporter plus investor in Gitcoin / $GTC I am here to offer my perspective.Bear in mind not everybody is in a situation to actively contribute to the development of the project itself. deltajuliet Let me open up about my situation. I am from humble origins and fell in love Gitcoin which at that time seemed to be the only ALTRUISTIC crypto initiative.With my household savings i invested roughly $20,000 to purchase 1000 $GTC (my one and only crypto to this day) in the hope that my funds would directly or indirectly impact many lives.Obviously I had a smaller selfish motive(like all of you here) to make some profit. In the years all I have seen is that numerous projects funded by Gitcoin have done incredibly well financially for investors. $GTC has been brutal, my $20,000 is today worth $380( am I moonboi to be in this forum?) VB, owocki are some of the biggest names in this space but somewhere something has gone wrong.Praying I get my investment back even if I don‚Äôt make any profit.I still love and believe in Gitcoin and in extension $GTC‚Äù</p>
<p>Top 2 - Recce ‚ÄúThis has taken a long time coming.In essence $GTC cannot keeping going the way it has been. Might be high time to change the narrative from purely governance and amplify it 100x. While it is a non speculative asset, but the fact remains that there are 100K + wallets that hold GTC and a lot of them hold it from an investment perspective. Do they deserve utility with their tokens? What do we give them back for the faith they have reposed on us? One of the recent threads about Regenerating GTC is an eye opener (unable to post link here) never realized how GTC has sunk from $22.37 to $0.50 now. That is shocking especially for those faithful who still hold this token! Do we pump the token- NO. Do we create an environment for it to get back to previous ATH- BIG YES‚Äù</p>
<p>Top 3 - Recce  ‚ÄúThanks Kevin- this is what I envisage but I am constrained by my lack of knowledge of writing up a detailed proposal. Any volunteers here who could assist-Help Help? Basically a burn with the revenue + stable coin stash and additionally an ongoing buyback/burn mechanism. $GTC definitely needs to have more traction. The healthier our fiscal outlook faster will be our traction. For the massive opportunities that Gitcoin offers, GTC ideally needs to be a top 50 token ATLEAST (emphasis on utility here), people dont take much notice of a project that is beyond 100-200 in rankings .I am an outsider here who loves and believes in the project, wants it to reach a MUCH bigger audience- glad my voice is being heard rather than being dismissed! I want Gitcoin to be a $50 Billion entity! Bigger the bourse, more the number of projects that can be funded, more impact and rapid development of Web3. We only live only life so need to see it to fruition sooner than later‚Äù</p>
<p>SimScore API is ready for deployment.  Our next project is to integrate SimScore as a Discourse plug in so DAO delegates and proposers can reduce the <strong>‚ÄúOverwhelm‚Äù</strong> and work on the most important ideas first.</p>

            <p>I think the GIVpower model is awesome and thanks for laying it out here. What we‚Äôre planning for GG23 is heavily inspired by this, though will be pared down in MVP format as we test to see how it‚Äôs received and how we can build upon it!</p>

<p>GIVpower brings some real wins as a governance tool while also creating demand for $GIV.</p>
<h3><a name="how-givpower-generates-demand-2" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#how-givpower-generates-demand-2"></a>How GIVpower Generates Demand <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/fire.png?v=12" title=":fire:" class="emoji" alt=":fire:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></h3>
<p>Demand is driven by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prioritizing projects</strong> at the top of QF rounds</li>
<li><strong>The stake &amp; lock mechanism</strong> (inspired by the popular veCRV model but with friendlier parameters)</li>
<li><strong>Impacting GIVbacks percentages</strong> (though this has created less demand than expected)</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="a-governance-upgrade-3" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#a-governance-upgrade-3"></a>A Governance Upgrade <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/control_knobs.png?v=12" title=":control_knobs:" class="emoji" alt=":control_knobs:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></h3>
<p>In the <strong>Giveth DAO</strong>, we‚Äôve moved away from using liquid $GIV for governance. Instead, GIVpower introduces a <strong>non-transferable</strong> token that operates behind the scenes.</p>
<h3><a name="how-governance-works-4" class="anchor" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co#how-governance-works-4"></a>How Governance Works <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/balance_scale.png?v=12" title=":balance_scale:" class="emoji" alt=":balance_scale:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></h3>
<p>GIVpower is calculated based on staking and locking mechanics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stake GIV</strong> ‚Üí Receive <strong>1 GIVpower</strong> per GIV</li>
<li><strong>Lock GIV</strong> ‚Üí Receive a <strong>GIVpower multiplier</strong> based on:</li>

<li><strong>Lock for 2 weeks</strong> ‚Üí <strong>1.414 GIVpower</strong> per GIV (minimum lock period)</li>

<p>Long-term commitment is rewarded. If you lock for a year, you get <strong>5x more voting power</strong>‚Äîwhich makes a lot of sense for governance, IMO.</p>

<p>We currently <strong>reward GIVpower users</strong>, but for a potential ‚ÄúGITpower‚Äù model, I‚Äôd consider omitting this to <strong>avoid inflation</strong>. The added governance powers already provide strong <strong>financial incentives</strong> through QF rounds.</p>

            <p>Happy to read this.</p>
<p>Re: curation power.<br>
I think the most cost efficient and ‚Äòeasy‚Äô thing to implement here is taking over the boosting model from Giveth, i.e. GIVPower.</p>
<p>Was just donating on Giveth, and always loved it, I go in there often to change my boosting.</p>

<p>This is because crypto is very risky (and especially small caps like Gitcoin are especially risky), and while we are working hard to make Gitcoin successful, there is no guarantee that Gitcoin is going to make it.</p>

<p>I do think a great use case for GTC utility would be to get some upside in projects that are alumni.</p>
<p>For example a project like uniswap now has a $10bn fully dilluted value, but got some of its first capital on Gitcoin. But the same is also true for other alumni: 1inch exchange, walletconnect, and so on‚Ä¶</p>
<p>If Gitcoin was able to get just 1% of each of these projects at seed stage, it would be a viable business for a very long time.</p>
<p>Gitcoin has an unfair competitive advantage over other seed stage investors/funders bc it finds the coolest, newest, best stuff, first.  If it were to launch a venture fund I think it would do very well.</p>
<hr>
<p>That said, I think there are other worthwhile ideas here too:</p>

<p>It is true that $GTC originally launched in May 2021 as a governance token with no economic value.</p>
<p>It is also true that as the DAO evolved over time in the next years, in tandem with the market, that the community did begin to attribute utility/value to it.</p>

<p>What i want to react to here is your sense of expectation that OTHERS should be doing more.  Where does it come from?  Were you promised something that wasnt delivered?  Or is it just an expectation, but not an agreement?</p>
<p>From <a href="https://yourtimetogrow.com/do-you-create-expectations-or-agreements/#:~:text=Expectations%20are%20preconceived%20ideas%20of,between%20two%20or%20more%20people.">expectations vs agreements</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expectations are often unspoken, while agreements are usually explicit.</strong> When we have expectations, we don‚Äôt always communicate them to the other person and are often what we think someone should do or be. This can lead to misunderstandings and disappointment. Agreements, on the other hand, are made explicit. This means that both parties know what is expected of them and can hold each other accountable.</li>
<li><strong>Expectations can be unrealistic,</strong> often based on our hopes and dreams and set too high. While agreements are more realistic - based on what is possible and achievable and on what both parties are willing to do <a href="https://yourtimetogrow.com/5-tips-to-maintain-healthy-boundaries-and-not-feel-guilty/">(boundaries anyone?!)</a></li>
<li>When we have expectations, they can be one-sided and we often focus on what we want from the other person. This can lead to resentment and anger. <strong>Agreements, on the other hand, are usually mutual.</strong> This means that both parties are making promises and commitments to each other.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>We need to turn more of these expectations into agreements‚Ä¶</p>
<p>To do that, we need more gov proposals that create agreements about resources, their uses, and how that impacts GTC.</p>
<p>I agree that Gitcoin has been in a wayward path for the last couple years, but I am always trying to be constructive and actionable in how I push feedback.  <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki/summary">Just take a look at these stats</a> or <a href="https://x.com/owocki/status/1868691732629504511">these stats</a> here.</p>
<p>You‚Äôre right you dont have to be owocki to evolve GTC forward.  But you can do 1/100th and still have a positive impact. The energy we need is constructive , informed, and actionable. Feel free to read through the wealth of public information about what the network could be doing and‚Ä¶    If you have anything constructive to add, especially proposals for experiments, feel free to suggest it, or action it yourself.</p>

            <p>Good to see a discussion on this subject - better late than never.While I am an avid supporter plus investor in Gitcoin / $GTC I am here to offer my perspective.Bear in mind not everybody is in a situation to actively contribute to the development of the project itself. <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/deltajuliet">@deltajuliet</a> Let me open up about my situation. I am from humble origins and fell in love Gitcoin which at that time seemed to be the only ALTRUISTIC crypto initiative.With my household savings i invested roughly $20,000 to purchase 1000 $GTC (my one and only crypto to this day) in the hope that my funds would directly or indirectly impact many lives.Obviously I had a smaller selfish motive(like all of you here) to make some  profit. In the years all I have seen is that numerous projects funded by Gitcoin have done  incredibly well financially for investors. $GTC has been brutal, my $20,000 is today worth $380( am I moonboi to be in this forum?) VB, <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a> are some of the biggest names in this space but somewhere something has gone wrong.Praying I get my investment back even if I don‚Äôt make any profit.I still love and believe in Gitcoin and in extension $GTC</p>

            <p>Of course GTC is not a casino token, it is a token generated with a purpose and gitcoin is a great project considering the all things that it provided to crypto environment so far. However you made some mistakes for sure with $GTC.</p>
<p>While you are paying all the expenses with $GTC, you said $GTC has no economic value in the blog post ?? What a needless sentence.</p>
<p>While every month or so someone mentioned the bad status of $GTC, you never acted on time. This happened for almost three years. You are still wasting time. A guy following the discussions for a long time telling you the reality, you guys still focusing on stats of him. To see the future of $GTC, we don‚Äôt need to be owocki. I don‚Äôt even need to understand gitcoin to warn you. It is very obvious, treasury shrinked to a few millions which is a big red flag for the future of GITCOIN not $GTC only.</p>
<p>Sorry but you don‚Äôt seem to care about token very much. Even if you release a new token to pump treasury, considering your performance with $GTC, you definitely have no luck. Another attempt to live for another bear.</p>
<p>You can wait for $GTC to get its value by itself for sure, because it is really good project, it might happen in a few years if you have fuel in treasury <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> But you should have known better than us, a tokens success is in the hands of project team, or whales if they get the majority of your supply <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> you definitely have failed so far because you are extremely slow at taking actions for $GTC, while superfast deciding on meeting expenses.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/recce">@Recce</a>, thanks for sharing your perspective. If you‚Äôre truly invested in Gitcoin and $GTC‚Äôs progress, I encourage you to move beyond commentary and explore the work we‚Äôve been doing further. Our token was designed for governance‚Äîand real utility (now)‚Äîis a vision advanced through failure, iteration, and hands-on effort. While identifying challenges is important, true transformation comes from proposing actionable solutions and stepping up to help implement them.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd love for you to join our governance discussions and contribute directly to shaping our future. We need community leaders who consistently show up, share informed ideas, and turn insight into tangible progress. We‚Äôre working together to drive real change for $GTC.

            <p>Sure I joined 2 days ago, but what if I told you I have been following every single post here since inception? Does that make me an outsider- I don‚Äôt think so.I have been reading proposal after proposal about $GTC for years with nothing tangible on the ground.Sometimes it takes someone outside of the silo to walk in when things are going in circles.I know $GTC is not a casino token but then we need to walk the talk with utility. It has to be one or the other. Thanks <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/deltajuliet">@deltajuliet</a> for your response - your initiatives are lovely!I am only offering my 2 cents,sorry if my suggestions come across as anything I don‚Äôt intend.

            <p>+1 to <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a> here - And enjoying the energy in these discussions as we chart our path forward for GTC‚Äôs evolution.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/recce">@Recce</a> , I appreciate your enthusiasm and willingness to contribute.</p>
<p>However, given you‚Äôve joined just 2 days ago‚Äîand judging by your stats, haven‚Äôt yet had the chance to dive deep into our work‚ÄîI encourage you to read up on the evolution of Gitcoin and the utility of GTC.</p>
<p>Remember, this isn‚Äôt a casino token; GTC was created for governance, and now we‚Äôre evolving it into something even more impactful. Our conversations are built on years of cumulative insight, thoughtful research, and deep engagement with our community‚Äôs work. The discussions around GTC‚Äôs utility stem from sustained efforts and lessons learned from initiatives that didn‚Äôt gain traction, and now we‚Äôre focused on solving for that, as outlined in our recent posts and referenced threads.</p>
<p>For our community: Impactful dialogue comes from understanding the full context.</p>
<p>Before offering feedback or alternative ideas, I urge you to fully immerse yourself in our previous discussions‚Äîespecially as we move beyond theoretical talk into actionable steps for sustainable impact. Our strength lies in our informed, collaborative approach to evolving our token utility.</p>
<p>I invite you <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/recce">@Recce</a> ‚Äîand anyone new to the conversation‚Äîto review the rich archive of our discussions. Once you‚Äôve had the opportunity to catch up, I‚Äôm confident that your contributions will be more meaningful and aligned with our mission. Contribute, please, but do so with substance rather than speculation.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your continued commitment to making Gitcoin a leader in powering public goods. Let‚Äôs keep building, learning, and growing together.</p>

Basically a burn with the revenue + stable coin stash and additionally an ongoing buyback/burn mechanism. $GTC definitely needs to have more traction. The healthier our fiscal outlook faster will be our traction. For the massive opportunities that Gitcoin offers, GTC ideally needs to be a top 50 token ATLEAST  (emphasis on utility here), people dont take much notice of a project that is beyond 100-200 in rankings .I am an outsider here who loves and believes in the project, wants it to reach a MUCH bigger audience- glad my voice is being heard rather than being dismissed!

<p>this might be one option for what to do with the current stablecoins + revenue (over $1m in revenue in 2024).  i would welcome a proposal to buyback and burn $GTC.  if anyone wants to draft one, please feel free.</p>

            <p>Yes one segment ie the grantees have definitely benefited on a large scale (magic of QF). But it is only befitting that all stakeholders including investors who trusted us the most are also onboard our journey.Personally I am not clued up with tokenomics however I have asked some friends in the industry for suggestions which I will share here once received. I‚Äôve read in one of the previous posts that if we get all projects we collaborate with- example - SEI,POLYGON etc to contribute in some way it could help have an exponential impact. Alternatively might help getting them buyback $GTC tokens for a burn so supply could be reduced.Btw what is the current supply even? Different sources ( Coinmarketcap, Coingecko etc) have varied numbers.</p>

<p>I agree that while the token utility trendline has not been promising.</p>
<p>On the plus side,</p>

<li>Gitcoin accomplished prettymuch everything it set out to do <a href="https://x.com/owocki/status/1875993760536084930">with the DAO launch in 2021</a>,</li>

<p>Do you have any suggestions for what type of additional utility to build into GTC?  Who do you think should be responsible for upgrading the network software to provide such utility?   Would love to see a proposal! <a href="https://manual.gitcoin.co/governance-processes/proposals">Heres how to submit one.</a></p>

            <p>This has taken a long time coming.In essence $GTC cannot keeping going the way it has been. Might be high time to change the narrative from purely governance and amplify it 100x. While it is a non speculative asset, but the fact remains that there are 100K + wallets that hold GTC and a lot of them hold it from an investment perspective. Do they deserve utility with their tokens? What do we give them back for the faith they have reposed on us? One of the recent threads about Regenerating GTC is an eye opener (unable to post link here)  never realized how GTC has sunk from $22.37 to $0.50 now. That is shocking especially for those faithful who still hold this token! Do we pump the token- NO. Do we create an environment for it to get back to previous ATH- BIG YES</p>

<p>Staking Models: Pilot GTC staking to enhance Sybil resistance and incentivize trustworthiness.</p>

</aside>
<p>How about an experimental Tunable QF Round where matching amounts are tuned based on Community GTC Staking score from the identity staking stamp in Passport? The more unique stakes you receive from the community, the stronger is your voice in the allocations. That way, holders who may not want to donate in every QF still have the option of staking for a trustworthy donor to amplify their contributions.</p>

            <p>Venice token utility is staking for api access <a href="https://x.com/jessepollak/status/1883942709179867321?s=46&amp;t=X0oQ26a3ezptVAZLp1QFaw" class="inline-onebox">x.com</a></p>
<p>i wonder if something like this (staking GTC for api access or to use gitcoin official frontends) could be a way to add utility for gtc.</p>
