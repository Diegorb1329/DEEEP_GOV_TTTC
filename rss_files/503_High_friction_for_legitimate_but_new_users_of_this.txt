    I'm a legit user. I had a specific proposal for improving the Gitcoin homepage. After signing up for this forum with GitHub, I wasn't able to post. There was no clear indication as to why, just no "New topic" button, so I ended up using the Reply function on an unrelated post. Paradoxically, this is exactly [what spammers do](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/whats-with-the-spam-in-the-code-of-conduct-topic/10818) - this new post blocking measure has already backfired.

It so happens that I also run a Discourse forum of my own, so I knew what I had to do in order to move up one trust level, but most users won't be able to easily figure that out. Yes, there's a link to [Understanding the Discourse Trust Levels](https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/) but many users may not click through that.

I believe onboarding could be better by:

1. Spelling out in that first @discobot message what a user needs to do in order to be able to post.
2. Bump the trust level already for GitHub SSO logins.
3. Offer a faster alternative verification mechanism for bumping up the trust level.
