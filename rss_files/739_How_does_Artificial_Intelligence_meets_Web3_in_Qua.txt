https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-does-artificial-intelligence-meets-web3-in-quadraticland/4481
    For anyone with a strong background in A.I., just like me, with little or no prior knowledge or experience in blockchain technologies (besides trading) and Web3, how can such individual be ushered into this field?

Can there be a clear mentorship pathway for beginners in Quadraticland?

I‚Äôve read that blockchain, artificial intelligence and edge computing are the core of Web3. Albeit, it‚Äôs interaction/interception remains unclear (to me).
