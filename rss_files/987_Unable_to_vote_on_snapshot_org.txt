    Hi, I hold some GTC which was claimed as part of airdrop. I am trying to vote on proposals but when I connect my wallet it shows that I have 0 GTC. What am I doing wrong? Thanks!

            <p>Perhaps <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/thinking.png?v=12" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> there is a snapshot taken prior to the vote cycle. That may be the case until onchain voting becomes implemented.</p>

            <p>Hi there,<br>
Little up ;).<br>
So i purchased a small amount of GTC? I deleguated it using delegate.gitcoin</p>
<p>When i check the with â€˜delegate lookupâ€™:</p>
<p>It correctly states that *Myadress has delegated 117 token to my ENS.eth</p>
<p>Yet I still canâ€™t vote on snapshotâ€¦<br>
Any idea why.<br>
It is annoying :(.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p>It all depends on your block number for the coins you hold (you can check from the recent txn hash), so if you got your coins after the proposals block number snapshot you will not be able to participate.</p>

            <p>if you delegated to a steward then they will be voting on your behalf, if you self delegated you can vote.</p>
