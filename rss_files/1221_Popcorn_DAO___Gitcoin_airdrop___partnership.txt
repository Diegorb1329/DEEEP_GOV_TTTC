Popcorn DAO & Gitcoin airdrop + partnership
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/popcorn-dao-gitcoin-airdrop-partnership/11191
    Hi all

Popcorn DAO (popcorn.network) is growing and looking to engage other similarly driven community members to amplify its social and environmental impact.

The Popcorn community is discussing a proposal to nominate Gitcoin as one of the communities to receive a $POP token airdrop (https://forum.popcorn.network/t/pop-airdrop-to-strategic-partners/637).

If approved, the Popcorn team would love to work with Gitcoin to promote and implement the airdrop.

We also welcome any interested Gitcoin community to join the Popcorn Discord and explore our common goals and how we could work together. Be sure to let us know you‚Äôve come from Gitcoin.

**About Popcorn**

Popcorn is a carbon neutral DeFi network that funds social and environmental impact organisations via proceeds from curated yield-generating products (see popcorndao.finance)

We are also interested in other partnership opportunities that could further amplify the collective social and environmental impact of our two DAOs.
