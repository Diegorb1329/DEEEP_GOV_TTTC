## Summary

The outside world often sees crypto as little more than a decentralized casino but an optimistic counternarrative has emerged around the Gitcoin community. This vision, known as the Infinite Garden, reveals that crypto gives us coordination superpowers. 

I intend to cultivate the Infinite Garden vision through a fun and accessible card game. 

Prototype V1: https://twitter.com/mettahead/status/1630018583458906113

## Abstract

Web3 is an epic adventure. Many of us are here trying to save the world using new coordination tools. We form guilds with like-minded travelers, earn tokens, and fight each day to slay Moloch. Meanwhile, the outside world continues to fracture and the internal crypto space faces ceaseless scams, multibillion-dollar contagion outbreaks, and plot twists revealing master villains (looking at you SBF).

Web3 empowers us to be heroes on this adventure, but new crypto settlers are often unaware of this path. Even many experienced crypto users aren’t following the plot. That is understandable, because humans make meaning through stories, and the prevailing narratives of crypto revolve around money, fear, and greed.

I believe that for Gitcoin‘s mission to succeed, it must amplify regen stories that are informative, fun, and accessible to all.

Together, the community has begun crafting the lore of this story. In the project I am proposing Moloch, Ether’s Phoenix, and the Dark Forest are just the beginning of a new, uplifting mythology represented in the Infinite Garden Trading Card Game (TCG).

![Splash_03|690x403](upload://8UM1xg5VzgS5kJGpvrXhkTFbFXJ.jpeg)

## Motivation

Crypto is at a critical inflection point. Gitcoin’s choice to invest in this project will help realize a positive-sum future for the following reasons:

1. Everyone loves a good game. That makes them core infrastructure for the degen to regen pipeline. Unlike linear entertainment, games evoke feelings of freedom, creativity, responsibility, accomplishment, and friendship. These feelings mirror the core values of Gitcoin and the larger regen ecosystem. My experience of handing out a few hundred Edition 0 cards at ETHDenver also reminded me that our community loves physical swag.

![|624x229](upload://iHKTkxeivR33R6Abmn7HMPW7zKX.jpeg)

2. The Infinite Garden TCG mirrors reality. Every card has abilities in the game, and every character, technology, and gameplay mechanic also represents a powerful force in the real world. The game will present critical concepts like private keys and self-sovereign identity in a way non-technical folks can grok.

3. Web3 is by nature adversarial. Newcomers consistently fall for the same schemes and OGs can do a better job of passing along the wisdom of past cycles. The Infinite Garden mythology will feature relatable characters and lore that orient and guide new adventurers through the cryptoverse.

4. New settlers are not the only people confused about web3; many crypto elders are still unaware that “Ethereum isn't here to make you rich, Ethereum is here to set you free" (Vitalik Buterin). Beliefs motivate behavior and it is essential we make Gitcoin's vision clear and attractive.

5. Public goods awareness needs to increase in the NFT space. The NFT community has an outsized impact on how the world perceives crypto but our PFP frens are generally oblivious to the regen way. The Gitcoin x MetaLabels drop, Creature World collaboration, and PublicNouns projects have made promising headway and the Infinite Garden TCG is the next step to trojan horse our regen crypto values.

6. For those of us already Greenpilled: the Infinite Garden TCG represents a celebration of the adventures that have brought us here--and an inspiring vision of what we hope to buidl together next.

## Specifications

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**

This first prototype was very well received by the community at ETHDenver '23:

https://twitter.com/mettahead/status/1630018583458906113

The next phase of the project will include completing a regen library wiki (recording the lore) and a pilot program that tests gameplay and new art.

I have recently dedicated my full-time work to this project with a primary focus on creative direction, project coordination, and art assets for the Alpha Set. A few others have joined to work part-time on gameplay. All work up to this point has been unpaid.

**Gameplay:**

We're currently testing two game modes: Competitive (training to battle Moloch) and Cooperative (team up with frens to slay Moloch).

We are also exploring two crossovers between the finite TCG game and the infinite game of crypto .

1. The game's IRL events will be focused on building meaningful community (starting with gatherings and tournaments at crypto conferences) and real-world impact (imagine the only way to get the coolest/best cards is to take the Greenpill Pledge or hand out pizza to the homeless with PizzaDAO).
2. Long-term, the Infinite Garden TCG should be a bottom-up headless brand. We are all living the web3 adventure and the community should guide how it is mythologized. Governance specifics will be ironed out when the time comes (hopefully we will have improved systems by then).

**Bio:**

As a Creative Director with Gitcoin, my art helped fundraise over half a million dollars for the Gitcoin Grants Matching Pool since 2021. Ethereum's culture and values are central to my creative work and I have continued to dedicate my art sales to funding social causes. I have a proven record of project generation, initiation, development, and completion.

## Benefits

Memes:

* The next billion crypto users need inspiring and informative stories to guide them through the cryptoverse. Those of us deep in web3 want to celebrate this extraordinary adventure. The Infinite Garden cards will depict meaningful memes and the gameplay will create an immersive experience for exploring crypto mechanics and this diverse ecosystem.

Money:

* The Gitcoin community can propose 3-5 cards to be included in the Alpha Set. For example: Grants Festival, Schelling Point, Passport, Moonshot Bots, Quadratic Lands, Allovi (Spirit of the Allo Protocol) . . . what elements of Gitcoin do you want to see?

* 10-20% of Alpha Set primary sale profits will go to the Gitcoin Grants Matching Pool. At this early stage of development, it is unclear how many cards will be sold for the Alpha Set. The print run will depend on market conditions and which conference we release at.

## Drawbacks

The cards and gameplay have great traction, but they may be a flash in the pan that fizzles out as time goes on. In that case, the regen library wiki would live on and we would still have cool collectable cards that raised money for the Matching Pool while turning degens into regens.

## Vote:

1 - Yes to $10k to build the Alpha Set (40-69 cards including 3 proposed by the Gitcoin community and 10% of primary sale profits to the Matching Pool).

2 - Yes to $20k to build the Alpha Set (69-150 cards including 5 proposed by the Gitcoin community and 20% of primary sale profits to the Matching Pool + ability to bring on additional roles, such as developers, marketing support, game designers, and business development).

3 - No, do not invest in the Infinite Garden TCG.

I’m looking forward to hearing from the community!

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/colton">@Colton</a> has a proven track record in delivering for Gitcoin, and I believe it’s in the DAO’s best interest to continue to engage him in building out accessible, fun, and mission-driven storytelling of its “why”; there is no better person for the job. I will vote yes on this proposal.</p>
<p>I’ll also note that I had a chance to check out the cards IRL at ETHDenver — even the prototype looked incredibly polished &amp; professional! Couldn’t believe it was “homemade”.</p>
<p>That said, a thought on the process here: I know GCPs are new territory altogether, but at first glance I’m not sure the GCP process is necessarily right for this. IMO, something of this relatively small ticket size should go through workstream budgets — likely MMM’s in this case, as <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/griff">@griff</a> suggests — rather than being an independent proposal of its own. And, if the conversation <em>was</em> had with MMM or other workstreams and they opted not to fund it, that should be disclosed to stewards too as it’s important context in the funding decision.</p>

            <p>I think it is a great project, but I still think Gitcoin is spending too much money on things overall, so while i think the project has legs, I have to vote no and ideally this budget could be sourced from MMM</p>

            <p>I had some of Colton’s cards at the Supermodular both during EthDenver and many people had an immediate connection to the artwork and the lore. It was really fun to watch. The first question people had was were can they buy a deck and the second question was how can they play.</p>
<p>I could see a future where we could play the game pokemon go style when we go to a different conference.</p>

<p>For those delegating to me, I decided to vote for the $20k option instead of the $10k option. I did this as the $20k option gives an additional 10% in funding to the matching pool, and also likely gives a bit more room to develop cards and turn it into a viable game. I would hate to fund at the $10k mark and have this fail as they didn’t have enough funds to actually turn this into a playable and viable game.</p>

            <p>Hey Colton,</p>
<p>Finally had the time to read through this. I think there’s still a lot of unknowns, (also for me personally because I’m not a gamer <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> ) but I think if anyone deserves this funding it is you.</p>
<p>However, I will probably vote ‘abstain’, for the simple reason that I don’t think in our upcoming GCP v2 model it makes total sense for us to fund initiatives that I would consider to be purely community engagement. This post is very inspiring though, as I need to to figure out this week what the eligibility criteria for a GCP are. <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=12" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>In my current logic I would say this proposal belongs in the <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gcp-004-gitcoin-citizens-round/13462">Citizens Round.</a><br>
The first round is retroactive funding and you should submit your various projects separately for these I’d say.</p>
<p>However, I see a huge support here on your proposal (people know how much you already did for Gitcoin, and we love you for it), so that is why I would definitely not vote no, but will stick with an abstain, as more detailed rules are coming up.</p>
<p>Thanks for this proposal!</p>

            <p>This is so dope! Cant wait to see this done. What kind of card stock are you planning to use? It would be cool if the physical cards were made with cardistry in mind, in other words how they feel and look when shuffled in intersting ways. Check out this post for some examples. <a href="https://playingcarddecks.com/blogs/all-in/non-standard-playing-cards-a-new-standard-for-cardistry" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Non-Standard Playing Cards: A New Standard for Cardistry</a></p>
<p>I agree with the comments of all our fellow travellers in the quadratic lands in this thread and wanted to add a fidgety card jugglers perspective.</p>
<p>There are companies that specialize in making quality cards of these kinds. Here is one  popular options.</p>

            <p>Thank you so much for proposing this <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/colton">@Colton</a>! The ethos behind the genesis, the intended outcomes are all amazing and while I was reading, I wondered <strong>how can I get involved?</strong></p>
<p>I am highly supportive of the proposal, will probably vote for option 1 to start, but this is mostly because of the desire to better understand the gameplay mechanics before committing to much.</p>
<p>I try to play games frequently with my son, and knowing that I can share this lore and story with him in a (hopefully) simple gameplay that reinforces why we are advancing our purpose deeply resonates.</p>
<p>Yes, please let’s keep this work going! If you are willing, I would love to personally contribute to the process too. Perhaps I can ping you offline in how I can support?</p>
<p>One minor aside - Do you have any Alpha decks available for purchase yet too (the ones you handed out at Eth Denver)?</p>

            <p>Thanks!</p>

<li>
<p>Traditional marketing would likely burn the whole budget so IMO it makes sense to take a more creative and grassroots approach. The highest leverage opportunity I see is activating values-aligned people and projects to spread the word. We could incentives them by representing their projects as cards. For example, Kernel and Giveth should be represented and it would be a win/win for their communities to tweet about the cards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I used <a href="http://makeplayingcards.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">makeplayingcards.com</a> for the first prototype and the quality was top-notch for a reasonable price. Prices go down quickly as more cards are bought.</p>

            <p>Thanks! Nouns is one of the most elegant projects on the block. The trick is starting off with a bang. If the first one doesn’t sell for a lot of ETH the project will likely struggle. PublicNouns is working through this now.</p>
<p>I would like to see this project build an audience first, then embrace the Nouns model when the time is right.</p>

            <p>Big +1.</p>
<p>Love the mechanism of community-proposed cards to drive hype.</p>
<p>Curious if the funding requested includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>any formal marketing spend (ad placement, etc)?</li>
<li>a physical distributor/printer who you’ve already scoped/understand unit economics on (not sure what the term is here for game-publisher, out of my depth…)?</li>
</ol>

            <p>Absolutely love the idea and the visuals are fantastic, I’d vote for option 1. Any thoughts on a Nouns style auction mechanism with the ‘card art’ to fund this project?</p>

            <p>+1</p>
<p>Elliott from Global Unity has been involved with this project since Denver and I had a conversation with Magenta from Bloom Network last week. Both have projects that are seeking to incentives irl impact.</p>
<p>Perhaps all these composable pieces can fit together!</p>

            <p>I had a conversation with McKennedy earlier this week. The QF card game and Infinite Garden game are quite different and I would like to see both projects thrive!</p>
<p>Let’s keep this door open while we see how the GCP does.</p>
