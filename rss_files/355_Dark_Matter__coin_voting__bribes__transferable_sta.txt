    Hey all...I've started a bit of discussion over on the DFINITY forums(i know, i know) about some issues we're running into. It is a bit of a diatribe, but I figured if there might be any collective wisdom out there to help guide what is going on with our community, I'd love to hear it:

TLDR: Our smart contracts are getting the ability to hold "voting neurons" and that lets people DeFi them and potentially sell DAO votes.  I explore how it could be used for funding public goods.  I make up something called Quadratic Passion.

  <p>Value is about to exit your ICP Bag and no one seems to notice    h/t to @klac x.com for the media.  TLDR: Neuron Markets, Liquid Staking, and Quadratic Passion reduce the value of YOUR BAG. But can they be used to fund public goods that benefit...</p>
