    Hello to everyone!  Im new to the community and i was wondering what strengths and pitfalls(things that could be improved) other software developers see in Gitcoin as a way to monetize open source development.  As an individual programmer do you see this platform as potentially a full time job or a way to monteize your passion projects? I am very excited of the future Gitcoin is trying to create.

            <p>Thanks for the answer! Now it clicked how this type of monetization could change the industry. From an individual devâ€™s POV its an awesome way of getting in contact with other devs and joining a team as a full time job!</p>

<p>I think the <a href="https://gitcoin.co/results" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">$21.4m in Results | Gitcoin</a> speak volumes.</p>
<p>Perhaps <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a> has some good resources to hand to help you experience it best for yourself?</p>

            <p>I think itâ€™s based upon voting and managing the projects as a co-operative team and get public funding from the proposals they make upon the project. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/money_mouth_face.png?v=9" title=":money_mouth_face:" class="emoji" alt=":money_mouth_face:"></p>
