Gitcoin DAO - Week in Governance, Edition #1
https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-dao-week-in-governance-edition-1/7424
    This will be the first edition of a weekly post with the goal of summarizing what‚Äôs been going on in Gitcoin DAO Governance at the end of every week. Topics, ideas, proposals and votes will be listed with links for further reading and discussion. If there‚Äôs anything missing please reach out! üìù

### [ü§ñ Meta-Governance](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/governance-meta/6)

----------------------

* Community members are continuing to express interest in becoming [Stewards](https://gitcoin.co/blog/introducing-the-community-stewards-program/) in the DAO and govern for the public good with introductions rolling into the Steward Governance [thread](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-stewards-governance/41). No formal criteria have been set on becoming a Steward aside from interest in participating at this time.

* Several Stewards have begun drafting a version of formalized rules for governance based on existing rules found [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gtc-governance-process/782). It is expected that these will be ratified in the coming weeks, after a hectic start given some unexpectedly complex votes around Gitcoin Grants treasury management.

* The deadline for claiming GTC tokens ended this week. 97% of all tokens were claimed and the remaining tokens have been [transferred](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4cb118aac7c32aefeea94ffd5a6c7ff763674dd89a4ad3718dc6acca6f00635c) to the Gitcoin DAO treasury for future use by the community.

* Some members have suggested a second claim window using the funds in the treasury given the tight 30 day window for the first distribution. Join the discussion [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-second-claim-window-for-gtc/7388)!

* A [formal proposal](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gitcoin-seasons/7319) around season-based compensation for Stewards has been put forward by Fire Eyes, üî•_üî•, for community review. Callum describes seasons as ‚Äúa time period for Gitcoin Stewards to earn GTC for active participation in governance. It consists of the top 40 delegated addresses, with an open application process for community members to join.‚Äù

### [üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Workstream Discussion](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/workstream-discussion/9) + üìú[Proposal Updates](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/governance-proposals/5)

------------------------------------

[**Public Goods Funding / Treasury Management**](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-suggestion-public-goods-funding/129/1)

- Andrew‚Äôs [path forward](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/QmQe6fHVDsvE91ShNagvFojetuWHu6xKn7izk46Dg2cQmK) for AKITA was ratified by the community after healthy debate, and several stewards (Austin, Trent, Andrew, and Avsa) are working towards executing next steps.

- GR10 matching pool allocations were [ratified on Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/QmRbuBUX7vtNhYwYqYG3Jd4LqaRXVM8qDgjNojGEAzJdnH) with overwhelming agreement around the proposed categories.

- A [proposal](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gr10-matching-pool-use-gitcoin-to-build-gitcoindao/6372) to ‚ÄúUse Gitcoin to build GitcoinDAO'' was passed and an [open call for grants](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-building-gitcoin-round-now-open-for-gr10/6873) was started by Owocki. If you haven‚Äôt created a grant you still have time!

- Peter Pan asked an [important question](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-should-vc-funded-projects-get-clr-matched-funding/2505/20) around whether VC funded projects should be included in grants rounds moving forward. Discussion is still ongoing.

- Lior [proposed](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-onegtc-a-stablecoin-for-the-gitcoin-community/6505) a native medium of exchange for the Gitcoin community.

- The [$SACKS LP position](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/rfc-transfer-sacks-lp-position-to-gitcoin-governance-timelock/3262/7) was successfully transferred to GTC treasury for safekeeping

- To start, for simplicity, the DeFi Treasury Management workstream has been formed as a subset of the Public Goods Funding Workstream. Shreyas has begun working on a general values statement and strategy for treasury management expanding on his post [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-suggestion-defi-treasury-management/204). 


[**Public Goods Prototyping (Moonshot Collective)**](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-public-goods-prototyping/130)

Austin [announced](https://twitter.com/austingriffith/status/1407354567277359110) that the [Prototyping Workstream](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-suggestion-public-goods-prototyping/130) is now transforming into the [Moonshot Collective](https://moonshotcollective.space/), the first call is scheduled for July 19th at 12pm MST (invites can be found at [https://moonshotcollective.space](https://moonshotcollective.space/))

Active Projects:

1. Some interesting work being done around quadratic trust - a QF tool where you fund with your clout instead of your money
2. Gitcoin.dance - an NFT dance off for funding public goods, is targeted for GR11
3. SACKS launched last month, has raised $250k for public goods, and is still kicking (pun intended). Song a day man did a[ song about the project](https://twitter.com/songadaymann/status/1403813308134789128?s=19).
4. Bondable, an incentivized jobs board is being worked on (see Andrew‚Äôs grant / forum)
5. [BurnVendor](https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth/blob/burn-vendor/packages/hardhat/contracts/BurnVendor.sol)), an initial interface for burning Akita to get the ETH necessary for the LBP is in progress

Projects that are more highly visible on Gitcoin Grants are more likely to be funded. A [discussion](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-might-be-decentralize-gitcoin-grants-discovery/6874/8) around the decentralization of Gitcoin Grants Discovery was started by Owocki.

[**Decentralization Workstream**](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-suggestion-decentralize-gitcoin/180)

- Phutchins provided an [update](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/weekly-update-decentralize-gitcoin/3640/10) on Decentralizing Gitcoin and describes the progress as ‚ÄúOver the last week we‚Äôve made some great progress on the Architecture Proposal and are nearing completion of the initial draft. Most of the big pieces are getting clearer and are falling into place.‚Äù

- Furthermore, a new [thread](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-to-contribute-to-decentralize-gitcoin/7157) and a [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiaBa8kmcyTxsZ8mi1-kY65dsox3L6iwv3KTim8mmjGU1p4g/viewform) was created to help guide community members who wish to contribute to the decentralization of Gitcoin.

[**Anti-Sybil Workstream**](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-anti-fraud-workstream-assemble/158)

* The Anti-Sybil workstream has put forward a helpful guide for anyone looking to get involved. [Click Here to Inquire About Participation in This Workstream](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zHFjpbMZaxbOF4MuG6HFkRbHafOailwt8PN4Wmkyfh8/edit)

Ops, Comms, Edu

* Clarified the workstreams participants and status
* Hosted a full workstream Zoom on Tuesday, June 22nd

Grant Verification

* Oversight of the grant verification process is now [publicly available here](https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/Public-Grant-Approval-Oversight-Page-af7e9caa25b5478b901df5ac78349c4b)
* Recruited 4 community members approved by Workstream to participate in reviewing new grant applications & oversight of Gitcoin denials.
* Began defining policy for both the Platform & Eth rounds. Working to draft clear in/out of bounds territory.
* Documenting ‚Äúgray‚Äùzone cases for review

Detection of Sybil/Fraudulent Behavior

* Continued experimentation of specificity vs sensitivity of algorithm
* Human evaluation of algorithm for training data continues

Appeals, Sanctions, and Evolving Policy

* Work has begun with the coordinator role being assigned
* A first draft of an appeals process has been made for grants and users
* Rough consensus formed on using an English common law standard of precedents and appeals to update the policy

[**Merch, Memes, Marketing Workstream**](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/mmm-merch-memes-marketing-for-public-goods-gitcoin-gitcoindao/7066)

* Chris Martz [announced](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/mmm-merch-memes-marketing-for-public-goods-gitcoin-gitcoindao/7066) the MMM workstream, described as ‚Äúa small creative team operating in service of Gitcoin / GitcoinDAO, it‚Äôs wider community and it‚Äôs values and goals. [...] Using merch, memes and marketing MMM will create unique public goods, new projects, fun stuff that generates curiosity and hype around public goods, Gitcoin, open source software‚Äù.

That‚Äôs it for this week in Gitcoin DAO governance, feel free join the discussions via the links and on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/gitcoin)!

            <p>Kudos. The update is on point.<br>
Sybil is a major issue and it‚Äôs very technical to deal with. With time, GTC community will win over it.</p>
