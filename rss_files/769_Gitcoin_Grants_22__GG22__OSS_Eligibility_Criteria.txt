    # Gitcoin Grants 22 (GG22) OSS Eligibility Criteria

## Introduction

Gitcoin and our partners are collaborating to support the growth and development of the Open Source Software (OSS) ecosystem through a series of quadratic funding rounds. These rounds will allocate funds to support contributions to projects building and enhancing the OSS and digital public goods.

## Objectives

* Support projects contributing to the OSS and Web3 ecosystems
* Encourage wider community involvement through donations to projects, using donation volume as an indicator of engagement
* Foster innovation and development within various segments of the OSS ecosystem

## Program Philosophy

### Collaborative Approach

We encourage projects that seek to complement and enhance existing initiatives rather than competing directly against them. The success of this round is viewed as a collective achievement, benefiting the entire OSS ecosystem.

### Long-term Vision

We value projects demonstrating a commitment to sustained impact and growth within the OSS ecosystem. This round may be part of a series of recurring funding opportunities, and projects showing long-term potential will be well-positioned for future support.

### Community-Driven Success

The collaborative nature and positive community engagement in this round will influence the planning of future funding opportunities.

## General Eligibility Criteria

### Ethical and Community Standards

* No Hateful Content: We firmly stand against discrimination and hate speech.
* Deceiving Users: Prohibited is any content that could harm users or lead to unintended consequences.
* Falsification: Attempts to falsify contributions, including Sybil attacks or other manipulative practices, are strictly banned.
* Fraud & Impersonation: Projects must accurately represent their affiliation and intentions to maintain transparency and trust.
* No Quid Pro Quo & Bribery: Incentives in exchange for donations are disallowed, maintaining the integrity of the contribution process. For this round, we will follow Gitcoin's standard for QPQ.
* Advertising Restrictions: Utilizing grants for direct promotional activities or sales is prohibited.
* Funding Caps: Projects with significant external funding may be reconsidered to ensure equitable distribution of resources.
* Legal Compliance: Mandatory compliance with all applicable laws and regulations for participation.
* Positive Community Interaction: Projects are expected to maintain a supportive attitude towards other participants, contributing to a collaborative and constructive funding environment.

### Open-Source Principles and Project Activity

* Licensing Requirement:
  * Projects must be fully open source, offering "source available" for anyone to fork, modify, and redistribute.
  * All project repositories must utilize permissive licenses. Projects with non-permissive licenses undergo a manual review to ensure they still meet our open-source standards.
* Activity Metrics:
  * Projects are expected to demonstrate established and ongoing development activity, indicated by meeting at least three of the following criteria:
    * A first commit more than 90 days prior
    * A recent commit within the last 30 days
    * Activity on more than 20 days in the previous 90 days
    * Contributions from more than one individual
  * Projects that only meet two of these criteria will receive a manual review, whereas those failing to meet at least two criteria are deemed ineligible.

## GG22 OSS Rounds

GG22 will feature four funding rounds within Grants Stack, each with its own focus and eligibility criteria:

1. Hackathon Alumni
2. Applications
3. Web3 Infrastructure
4. Developer Tooling and Libraries

### Allocations

* Hackathon Alumni: $100,000
* Applications: $300,000
* Web3 Infrastructure: $300,000
* Developer Tooling and Libraries: $300,000

Applicants are limited to submitting their projects for a single round of funding. It is recommended that grantees choose the round that most closely matches their project‚Äôs primary mission and goals. By doing so, we aim to provide focused and impactful support and ensure resources are directed where they can achieve the greatest effect.

### Round-Specific Criteria

* Have a link to a Hackathon project page
* Must provide proof of participation in a hackathon in the last 18 months where what was produced aligns with Open-Source Principles and Project Activity criteria

## 2. dApps & Apps

Objective: To accelerate the development and adoption of Applications that offer novel utilities or services, particularly those addressing unmet needs within the ecosystem.

Target Areas for Funding:

* User Experience and Interface Design
* Financial Inclusion
* Educational and Onboarding Tools
* Social Impact Applications

Round-Specific Criteria:

* Demonstrate user-centric design and functionality
* Show contribution to ecosystem growth
* Present innovation in application use cases

## 3. Web3 Infrastructure

Objective: To strengthen the Ethereum ecosystem's foundational infrastructure by supporting projects crucial for its development, scalability, and security.

Target Areas for Funding:

* Core Client Teams & Development
* Staking Infrastructure and Diversity
* Decentralized Identity and Cross-Layer Solutions
* Security and Scalability Innovations
* Wallet Security and Privacy Technologies
* Standardization and Future-Proofing

Round-Specific Criteria:

* Demonstrate significant contribution to the Ethereum network's infrastructure
* Show engagement in pioneering development, particularly in enhancing privacy, interoperability, and user experience

## 4. Developer Tooling and Libraries

Objective: To support the development of tools and libraries that empower developers to build more efficiently and effectively within the OSS and Web3 ecosystems.

Target Areas for Funding:

* Development Frameworks and Environments
* Interoperability Tools
* Smart Contract Libraries
* Data Analytics and Visualization Tools

Round-Specific Criteria:

* Demonstrate how tools, libraries, or frameworks significantly reduce development barriers, improve efficiency, or enhance the security of Web3 projects
* Show support and usage within the developer community

## Evaluation Process

Our evaluation process combines quantitative measures, such as adherence to open-source licensing and active development indicators, with qualitative assessments, including the project's contribution to the OSS ecosystem, community engagement, and innovation.

## Conclusion

This eligibility framework for GG22 OSS funding rounds is designed to nurture various projects across development stages and focus areas within the open-source ecosystem. By establishing clear criteria, we aim to encourage sustained contributions, enhance community engagement, and ensure a transparent and inclusive selection process, fostering growth and innovation within the OSS ecosystem.

            <p>Unsolicited advice / feedback from an user <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/innocent.png?v=12" title=":innocent:" class="emoji" alt=":innocent:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>Hackathon alumni round. Application has some interesting / valuable / useful questions. As a user of Gitcoin I‚Äôm genuinely interested in knowing these, but they are hidden:</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/3/300a58f47bc5b19ce41e7b523c94052006c07551.png" data-download-href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/300a58f47bc5b19ce41e7b523c94052006c07551" title="image"><img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/3/300a58f47bc5b19ce41e7b523c94052006c07551_2_253x500.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="6QZ5s6sgwdAyFaLnnt9o80NDQ2J" width="253" height="500" srcset="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/3/300a58f47bc5b19ce41e7b523c94052006c07551_2_253x500.png, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/3/300a58f47bc5b19ce41e7b523c94052006c07551_2_379x750.png 1.5x, https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/optimized/2X/3/300a58f47bc5b19ce41e7b523c94052006c07551_2_506x1000.png 2x" data-dominant-color="F8F5F6"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Specifically this one:</p>

<p>Describe the progress and development of your project since the hackathon. What milestones have you achieved?</p>

<p>Maybe possible to make them public? That will enable ‚Äúwisdom of the crowds‚Äù QF more easier. Without knowing answers to these question it would require energy for research (wasted effort, data was already provided) or ‚Äúpopularity contest‚Äù.</p>

            <p>Thank you again for your help here <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/mathildadv">@MathildaDV</a> !<br>
We just had our weekly DAO call and Unlock Labs would want to apply for Apps and Dapps while Unlock DAO would like to apply for Tooling and Libraries. I know you said double OSS is not an option but was wondering if this still applies to different entities? Just wanting to make sure so we can act according to the rules and thank you again for your time!</p>

            <p>It‚Äôs possible that <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/stellaachenbach">@stellaachenbach</a> is applying for an OSS round as well as a Community Round, which anyone is welcome to do. But yes, one can only apply to one OSS round per project, but you can apply to as many Community Rounds as you wish.</p>

<p>I am trying to get in an application for Unlock Protocol since I am Lead Steward over there. We are trying to apply for probably two different matching funds since a lot has happened over at Unlock.</p>
<p>One I was trying to apply for today is the OSS Developer Tooling and Libraries one. I get on the following link (/oss-developer-tooling-libraries) but end up on the application form for ‚ÄúdApps and Apps.‚Äù</p>
<p>Can you help me navigate the correct link please <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/pray.png?v=12" title=":pray:" class="emoji" alt=":pray:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>Checker is a nice tool.</p>
<p>I remember some time ago it provided YES / NO / maybe indication whether my project meets the eligibility criteria. After the application though - based on that my perception is that it mostly helps the reviewers / round operators.</p>
<p>I used the word ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù in a different context. An example prompt for human intelligence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine you are Gitcoin Core / Community Council reviewing grant application to GG22. You are a trusted member of the community with broad knowledge of the Web3 / Regen / OSS ecosystem.</p>
<p>As you put some effort into reviewing the application, website, test driving the product, Twitter, GitHub you attain a good understanding of what the project is all about.</p>
<p>You want project to succeed, accomplish scale, become economically sustainable beyond grant money and ‚Äúmake world a better place‚Äù (such a cliche).</p>
<p>Please be honest, direct, precise, to the point. There are many projects to review, so do not overthink, only if something jumps to your mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I see no downside. There is ROI on human intelligence.</p>

            <p>Sorry for the late response! And thank you for the question. So do be eligible for any OSS round, you need an active repository that is actively managed. If you don‚Äôt have that right now, I would suggest that you start maintaining one so that you‚Äôre ready for when the next round goes live!</p>

<p>I would like to apply with a hackathon project, single commit to <code>readme.md</code> makes it automatically 3 ouf of 4 and no manual review, but it doesn‚Äôt feel right. It is not morally OK in my book, I think that the hackathon round (and other rounds) should promote projects that are actively developed.

<p>Or maybe I should apply anyway and highlight in the grant application which features I intend to develop. A financial lifeline allowing to focus on a project, without worrying about other, legacy, traditional sources of income such as job. It would be a great honour and privilege to continue working on open source public goods.</p>
<p>Question about roadmaps:</p>
<ul>
<li>grant application is more like a legal contract?</li>
<li>grant application is more like sales and marketing?</li>
</ul>
<p>About roadmaps and what already has been done:</p>

            <p>Great initiative, thank you for your hard work on this. Are design-focused projects also eligible? For example, we are working on an Open Design Guide (opendesign.guide), which is meant to be an onramp for designers into the open-source ecosystem. The project is fully open-source and built in public. It‚Äôs of course harder to track, since design and content contributors often don‚Äôt commit all their work in Github, but in various shared documents, design tools, etc. Nonetheless, all these projects need good design, and designers who do that work (or it‚Äôs going to be hard for most people to use them). Just curious, thanks for letting me know.</p>
