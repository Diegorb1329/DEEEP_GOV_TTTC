The objective of this post is to describe an MVP of "better impact funding" enabled by a combo move of a few diff communities I'm involved with, and also how to achieve Greenpill.network && Gitcoin-alignment. 

# Definitions

- What is Gitcoin Grants Stack? [Gitcoin Grants Stack](https://www.gitcoin.co/grants-stack) is a toolset for doing Capital allocation for community by community.
- What are Hypercerts? [Hypercerts](https://hypercerts.org/) are impact tracking NFTs. Think of them as ‚ÄúCarbon Credits, but (1) on-chain & (2) for any impact vector‚Äù.
-  What is Greenpill.network? [Greenpill.network](https://greenpill.network/) is a network-society that exports regenerative digital infrastructure to the world, with active local chapters in 15 locations worldwide (India, Colorado, Japan, Suriname, West Africa, etc)

# 1. HyperCerts based impact funding

[Hypercerts](https://hypercerts.org/) are impact tracking NFTs. Think of them as ‚ÄúCarbon Credits, but (1) on-chain & (2) for any impact vector‚Äù. You could have a hypercert for

1. Walking 10 little old ladies across the st.
2. Feeding 10 unhoused people.
3. Cleaning up 10 lbs of trash.
4. Planting 10 trees.
5. Taking 10 tons of carbon out of the atmosphere.

Hypercerts (made by our frens at Protocol Labs) are a powerful primitive for tracking impact (and maybe eventually financializing that impact down the line).

Mint a Hypercert here:

1. https://hypercerts.org/app/create#
2. Or here: https://givegratitude.io/

Arent hypercerts purdy?

![|116x149](upload://8uq9oS1lSxKqUhQiAhhxZx8LTCx.png)![|119x153](upload://lQrbWgxc79a9LJyhpGKASAAM7vP.png)![|123x157](upload://hv9BwJqWAFWfnYCwtkKDiTfIg8v.png)![|137x172](upload://qKe0FB2Dvn0sbGT0MlMW8q33q15.png)

IMO Hypercerts could eventually revolutionize impact funding. What if instead of spending ‚Öî of their time running a giant grant application operation, NGOs and impact focused projects could just mint hypercerts for when they do good + be rewarded when Impact Funders purchase them! The goal is Impact = Profit and itd be HUGE for impact alignment :)

My vision medium term is to integrate hypercerts into [Gitcoin Grants Stack](https://www.gitcoin.co/grants-stack), such that when you‚Äôre browsing a grants round you can see how much provable on-chain tracked impact a Grant has!

[![|624x361](upload://A7YGfZotA2a29nhpEfBIQnCmrnt.jpeg)](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/)

This would help shift Gitcoin Grants funder contribution decisions in Retroactive Public Goods Funding Rounds from ‚Äúgut feel, I like this grant‚Äù based decisions to ‚Äúthis project has x provable impact, and I‚Äôm weighting that highly in my decision‚Äù. Remembering, Repeating and Working-Through

Yay for more rational decisions with trackable provenance!!!

The above software is going to be built soon(‚Ñ¢), but near term I propose that Greenpill Chapters start doing work in the areas of

1. Local educational work, eg building their local meetups or hosting regen educational programs.
2. Local humanitarian work, eg feeding the unhoused or skills based educational programs.
3. Local environmental work, eg web3beach style trash cleanups + planting trees, etc.

And capturing lots of pictures + testimonials of their work, which will be uploaded into Hypcerts. Once the Grants Stack integration is done, we will be doing QF rounds with the Hypercerts displayed, but in the near term Owocki will agree to purchase the hypercerts directly off the Greenpill chapters! I have $3k in initial funding set up to purchase hypercerts + plan to raise more on a rolling basis in the future.

# 2. Gitcoin QF Street Teams

In an effort to amplify local impact, I‚Äôd be interested in seeing local Greenpill.network chapters do their own QF rounds to activate members of their own local community towards creating Impact.

Here is what the flow of funds at scale could look like:

![|624x420](upload://j9LhNkIv2waF6JYm8OVqX3as2GE.png)

As more & more rounds are operated, the value creation by the greenpill.network would begin to grow iteratively over time (every quarter):

![|624x359](upload://oEs1Wp45PFLXfQmzoVr1eFCGxqO.png)

To do so, we would recruit 3-5 chapter leads and run them through a ‚ÄúGitcoin QF Street Team Training Cohort‚Äù, which would comprise of

1. Tutorials on how to use the software.
2. Training on the logistics of operating a round.
3. Training on how to market the round.
4. People who pass the course will receive:

  1. Some initial funding to run a small round.
  2. A ‚ÄúGitcoin QF Street Team Round Operator‚Äù certification NFT.
  3. Opportunities to earn $$$ to run Gitcoin rounds.
  4. Opportunities to earn $$$ to train future Gitcoin QF Street Teams.


To seed the network I could commit tobe running quarterly $5k greenpill rounds for chapters that are

1. Spending 80%+ of their funds on impact
2. doing

4. Local educational work, eg building their local meetups or hosting regen educational programs.
5. Local humanitarian work, eg feeding the unhoused or skills based educational programs.
6. Local environmental work, eg web3beach style trash cleanups + planting trees, etc.

* 20% 80

## Schedule

All of this is tentative/.

Q3 2023

* $5k Greenpill QF round
* $3k in Hypercerts buy backs

Q4

* TBD Greenpill QF Round
* TBD in Hypercert buy backs
* Ideally this can be done on the new Hypcerts-enabled Grants stack!
* We‚Äôll do a podcast episode about our impact.

Learn, Evolve, Grow, Repeat until Impact = Profit worldwide

## Who‚Äôs who?

Who‚Äôs doing the ___? ___

1. Hypercerts tech buildout: Raid Guild
2. Funding this all: Owocki's NewCo
3. Gitcoin Street Team
   1. Teacher: Owocki + Guest Lecturers
   2. Scheduling: Carey
   3. Artwork for graduation NFT: Octavian
4. Writing a ‚ÄúHow to QF guide‚Äù? Owocki + Gitcoin has already written some too.

# 4: Success Not Guaranteed

# ![|271x271](upload://kIYQ17sfEmzqmf2Z0RqE4ANEWXL.jpeg)

The above projects are bold experiments in creating better impact funding. Success is not Guaranteed!

We will be taking a leap of faith together. By learning to cope with this uncertainty, trust each other, sensing risks/rewards, and generally coordinate with each other, we can make them successful.

We can only do it if we all choose to coordinate.

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/bitbeckers">@bitbeckers</a> In terms of ‚Äúproper brand valued implementation,‚Äù could you be more specific? Off prima facie, I would state that the implementation can vary from group to group or brand to brand, depending on the group/brand‚Äôs core values. An example is shown <a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/hypercerts-for-the-local-level/16750">here</a> on Hypercerts for the Local Level.</p>

            <p>Thanks so much for sharing <a class="mention" href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/owocki">@owocki</a>. Looking really forward to implement this with our chapters. It‚Äôs an incredible way to visualize the impact they‚Äôre creating and ensuring alignment simultaneously.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm particularly excited about enabling chapters to run local QF rounds. This will lead to simplified explanations, especially in local languages which will reduce barriers to onboarding. Ultimately, it will encourage local NPOs/projects (to begin with) to participate and leverage the mechanism, paving the way for substantial real-world adoption.</p>

            <p>I love this idea and vision for where it could go! Ultimately we need a multiprong approach to funding public goods, so this model looks exciting. I know on a small scale the GPN Ottawa team is launching a rooftop garden program while continuing to run onboarding and educational workshops. We want to help people unlock the power of crypto for the average person and realize that often showing over-telling works.</p>
<p>We will keep this hypercerts and local QF plan in mind.</p>
<p>I know some issues in this space are always around balancing funding what is proven and what has the potential to be. Down to participate in this experiment and get our hands dirty!</p>

<p>I like the way you‚Äôre presenting this. This eliminates lots of the red tape associated with impact certs like carbon or plastic credits the same way GG eliminates the funding red tape for small projects without a legal entity. Something like ‚Äúwalking to little old ladies across the street‚Äù makes it clear that impact is impact no matter how small it is. If you live in an area with a large population of seniors, this would be very impactful.</p>

<p>I ran a <a href="https://twitter.com/web3beach/status/1596121359842955266" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">mini grants program in 2022</a> and remember thinking it would be great to do a QF round instead. This could have grown the amount distributed and given participants more visibility - making them more excited about executing on their proposals. It‚Äôs great to run it back with QF and support from GPN for the next one. I think it will coincide with the Gitcoin Citizens round so we can piggy back on that.</p>
<p>I haven‚Äôt gotten around to onboarding these communities to hypercerts, this is a great opportunity to do so now that some of them have participated in GG18.</p>
<p>Will continue experimenting with all of these tools and integrating when/ where possible. Thanks for making all of this happen.</p>

            <p>Fantastic!!! Definitely great ideas here. I feel like hypercerts are hard to understand for some grantees. Happy to see the creativity when it comes to creating Green Pill chapters and learning exactly what we can do to prepare ourselves for the future of working together with public goods related projects.</p>

<p>IMO Hypercerts could eventually revolutionize impact funding. What if instead of spending ‚Öî of their time running a giant grant application operation, NGOs and impact focused projects could just mint hypercerts for when they do good + be rewarded when Impact Funders purchase them! The goal is Impact = Profit and itd be HUGE for impact alignment <img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>My vision medium term is to integrate hypercerts into <a href="https://www.gitcoin.co/grants-stack">Gitcoin Grants Stack</a>, such that when you‚Äôre browsing a grants round you can see how much provable on-chain tracked impact a Grant has!</p>
<p><a href="https://explorer.gitcoin.co/"><img src="https://gov.gitcoin.co/uploads/db4391/original/2X/f/fd35276166f5314f55de9433fb0b5c90e61ebdeb.jpeg" alt="" data-base62-sha1="A7YGfZotA2a29nhpEfBIQnCmrnt" width="624" height="361" role="presentation"></a></p>
<p>This would help shift Gitcoin Grants funder contribution decisions in Retroactive Public Goods Funding Rounds from ‚Äúgut feel, I like this grant‚Äù based decisions to ‚Äúthis project has x provable impact, and I‚Äôm weighting that highly in my decision‚Äù. Remembering, Repeating and Working-Through</p>
<p>Yay for more rational decisions with trackable provenance!!!</p>
<p>The above software is going to be built soon(‚Ñ¢), but near term I propose that Greenpill Chapters start doing work in the areas of</p>
<ol>
<li>Local educational work, eg building their local meetups or hosting regen educational programs.</li>
<li>Local humanitarian work, eg feeding the unhoused or skills based educational programs.</li>
<li>Local environmental work, eg web3beach style trash cleanups + planting trees, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>And capturing lots of pictures + testimonials of their work, which will be uploaded into Hypcerts. Once the Grants Stack integration is done, we will be doing QF rounds with the Hypercerts displayed, but in the near term Owocki will agree to purchase the hypercerts directly off the Greenpill chapters! I have $3k in initial funding set up to purchase hypercerts + plan to raise more on a rolling basis in the future.</p>

<p>In an effort to amplify local impact, I‚Äôd be interested in seeing local Greenpill.network chapters do their own QF rounds to activate members of their own local community towards creating Impact.</p>
<p>Here is what the flow of funds at scale could look like:</p>

<p>As more &amp; more rounds are operated, the value creation by the greenpill.network would begin to grow iteratively over time (every quarter):</p>

<p>To do so, we would recruit 3-5 chapter leads and run them through a ‚ÄúGitcoin QF Street Team Training Cohort‚Äù, which would comprise of</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Tutorials on how to use the software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training on the logistics of operating a round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training on how to market the round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who pass the course will receive:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some initial funding to run a small round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A ‚ÄúGitcoin QF Street Team Round Operator‚Äù certification NFT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opportunities to earn $$$ to run Gitcoin rounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opportunities to earn $$$ to train future Gitcoin QF Street Teams.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To seed the network I could commit tobe running quarterly $5k greenpill rounds for chapters that are</p>

<p>Spending 80%+ of their funds on impact</p>
